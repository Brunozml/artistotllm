The fundamental flaw in the description of Y Combinator as a seed funding program is that it's a misnomer. The fact that we're at least two steps before VC funding is a testament to the fact that we're not just a seed program, but a bridge between the early stages of entrepreneurship and the later stages of investment. It's a mistake to imply that we're just a seed program, when in fact we're a catalyst for the next stage of investment.
