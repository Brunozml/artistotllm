...the opinion of one's parents, or even the opinion of one's own self. But what if that's not enough? What if the most powerful motivator is not the opinion of others, but the opinion of oneself? What if the most compelling reason to start a startup is not to impress others, but to impress oneself? The problem is that the path to self-improvement is not always linear, and the journey to self-discovery can be fraught with uncertainty. But what if that uncertainty is not a weakness, but a strength? What if the uncertainty of the startup journey is not a deterrent, but a catalyst for growth? I've seen it happen to many of my friends, who have started their own startups in college, only to realize that the uncertainty of the journey is not just a challenge, but an opportunity. The uncertainty of the startup journey is not just a matter of whether you'll be successful or not, but whether you'll be able to learn and grow as a person. And that's a question that's not just relevant to the startup world, but to life itself.
