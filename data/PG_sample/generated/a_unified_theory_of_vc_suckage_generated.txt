...in the company itself, but rather in the "idea" that the company is going to make. They're essentially betting on the idea, rather than the company. This is why VCs are so willing to take on huge risks, even if the company is still in its infancy. It's a classic case of "I'll take a chance on a crazy idea because I'm a visionary, not because I have a clear understanding of the market." This is why VCs are often willing to overlook fundamental flaws in a company's business plan, as long as they believe in the idea behind it. It's a classic example of the "visionary investor" phenomenon, where the investor is more interested in the idea than in the actual company. This is why VCs often have a tendency to "disrupt" companies that are already successful, simply because they believe in the idea behind the disruption. It's a classic case of "I'll take a chance on a new idea because I'm a visionary, not because I have a clear understanding of the market."
