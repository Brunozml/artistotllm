But here's the thing: the Chinese system, the one that's been emulated by so many countries, including South Korea, is actually a relic of a bygone era. It's a system that's been in place for centuries, and yet it's still a far cry from the meritocratic, self-selecting system that we're trying to create here in the US. The Chinese system is a great example of how a society can be shaped by its own values and priorities, and how those values can be used to create a system that's designed to produce the results we want. But, as we've seen, that system is not as effective as we thought it would be. It's a system that's been designed to produce results, not to create a meritocracy.
