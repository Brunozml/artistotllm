* * *The Apple bug is a classic example of the fundamental flaw in their approach to software development. If they had to submit their code to the App Store, it would be a monumental task, not just because of the sheer volume of updates they need to release, but also because of the sheer complexity of the codebase. The fact that they can't even be bothered to submit their code to the App Store is a testament to their arrogance.* * *But what's even more disturbing is that this is not just a matter of Apple's incompetence. It's a symptom of a deeper problem: their fundamental misunderstanding of the software business. They think that by treating iPhone apps like music through iTunes, they can somehow magically create a seamless user experience. But the truth is, software is a fundamentally different beast from music or books. It's a complex, dynamic system that requires constant iteration and evolution.* * *And yet, Apple continues to cling to this outdated model, refusing to adapt to the changing landscape of the software business. They're like a ship that's been stuck in the mud for decades, refusing to change course even when the world around them is moving on.* * *The problem is, this is not just a matter of Apple's internal culture. It's a matter of their fundamental approach to software development. They're trying to create a software publisher, but they don't understand the underlying principles of software development. They're trying to control the user experience, but they don't understand the user.* * *And that's why the App Store is such a mess. It's a mess because Apple is trying to create a software publisher, but they're not understanding the software business. They're trying to control the user experience, but they're not understanding the user. It's a classic case of hubris, and it's going to be a long time before they learn.*
