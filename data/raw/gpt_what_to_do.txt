What to Do

Deciding “what to do” isn’t a grand mystery; it’s about aligning your interests with the realities of the world. Most people treat decision-making as a high-stakes moment when, in fact, the best choices come from a series of small, consistent experiments.

Take entrepreneurship. Rather than waiting for a crystal-clear, “obviously best” path, successful founders start with small, iterative experiments. They pick something they’re genuinely interested in, throw themselves into it, and then adjust based on what works and what doesn’t. This isn’t reckless risk-taking—it’s a disciplined process of learning and adaptation.

Consider career choices too. Instead of obsessing over some elusive “perfect” job, focus on opportunities that let you test your strengths and grow. If you’re good at problem-solving, tackle a challenging project. If you love creativity, build something from scratch. The goal isn’t to find the ideal situation immediately; it’s to develop the skills and insights that lead to better decisions over time.

The trick is to let your interests, skills, and a dose of practical experimentation guide you. Life isn’t a single decision but a series of choices that compound. Rather than waiting for the “right” moment or the “right” plan, start now and learn from the results. In the end, doing something—anything—is better than paralysis in the face of too many possibilities.

The takeaway? Don’t overthink the big question. Start small, experiment, and allow your experiences to refine your choices. That’s how you decide what to do in a world where certainty is an illusion.
