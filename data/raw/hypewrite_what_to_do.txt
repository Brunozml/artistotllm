What to Do

The most common question people ask me is "what should I do with my life?" It's usually followed by a list of options they're considering, as if they're hoping I'll pick one for them. But that's exactly the wrong way to think about it.

The right question isn't "what should I do?" but "what should I try?" Because here's the thing most people miss: you can't know what to do until you've tried things.

This seems obvious once you point it out, but it's something most people get wrong. They treat choosing what to do with their life like choosing an item from a menu. But life doesn't work that way. It's more like cooking than ordering.

I've noticed that the most successful people I know didn't follow some grand plan. Instead, they kept trying things until they found something that worked. The trying was the plan.

When I was younger, I thought I had to figure everything out before I started. I spent countless hours thinking about what to do instead of actually doing things. Now I realize this was like trying to learn to swim by reading about it.

The other mistake people make is thinking they have to choose one thing forever. That's not how it works either. What you do at 25 doesn't have to be what you do at 35. In fact, it probably shouldn't be.

This is particularly true now. In our grandparents' time, you could choose a career and stick with it for 40 years. That world is gone. The most valuable skill now is learning how to learn new things.

So what should you do? Start somewhere. Anywhere. The specific choice matters less than you think. What matters is starting. Because once you start, you'll learn things you couldn't have learned any other way.

You'll learn what you're good at. You'll learn what you enjoy. Most importantly, you'll learn what kind of problems interest you enough to keep you going when things get hard.

Don't worry about making the wrong choice. The only truly wrong choice is not choosing at all. Because here's the counter-intuitive truth: the best way to figure out what to do is to do something.

This feels wrong to most people. We've been trained to think we should figure everything out first, then act. But that's backward. Action creates clarity. Clarity rarely comes from just thinking.

I see this pattern with startups too. The founders who succeed aren't usually the ones with the perfect plan. They're the ones who start with something small and keep adjusting based on what they learn.

The same principle applies to careers, relationships, and pretty much everything else that matters. You learn by doing, not by thinking about doing.

So here's my advice: pick something that seems interesting and start. If it works, great. If it doesn't, you'll have learned something valuable for the next thing you try.

The most successful people I know aren't the ones who made the right choice first. They're the ones who kept making choices until they found something that worked.

So stop asking what you should do. Start trying things instead. The answer will emerge from the doing, not from the asking.
