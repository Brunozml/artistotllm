copies of good things. It's not impressive to make a copy of a good novel, or a good song, or a good scientific discovery. The only thing that's impressive is to make something new, something that didn't exist before. And that's true not just in science and the arts, but in all areas of life. A new business, a new product, a new service - all of these are new things, and all of them require the same kind of thinking that makes good new things.

But why is newness essential? One reason is that it's the only way to make progress. If we only copied what existed before, we'd never get anywhere. We'd be stuck in a world where everything was the same, where there was no innovation, no improvement, no growth. And that's not just true in the abstract - it's true in our own lives. When we only copy what others have done, we're not learning, we're not growing, we're not improving. We're just repeating what's already been done.

Another reason newness is essential is that it's the only way to be truly original. When we make a copy of something, we're not being original - we're being derivative. We're taking someone else's idea and passing it off as our own. But when we make something new, we're being original. We're creating something that no one else has created before, something that's unique to us. And that's what makes it truly valuable.

But making good new things is hard. It's hard because it requires us to think in new ways, to see the world from new angles, to make connections that no one else has made. It's hard because it requires us to take risks, to venture into the unknown, to face the possibility of failure. And it's hard because it requires us to be patient, to persevere, to keep working even when the going gets tough.
