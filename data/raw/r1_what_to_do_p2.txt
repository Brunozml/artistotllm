But what counts as new? The threshold varies by field. In mathematics, a novel proof of an existing theorem can be profound. In cooking, a subtle twist on a classic dish might be celebrated. Newness isn’t binary; it’s a spectrum. The key is that the thing you make must add something that wasn’t there before, even if incrementally. The first wheel was revolutionary, but so was the addition of spokes. Both expanded what humans could do.

Some might argue that novelty is overrated—that refinement matters more. But refinement is a form of newness. To improve something is to create a new version of it. The danger lies in mistaking repetition for progress. A baker who makes the same loaf every day, however perfect, isn’t advancing the craft. But one who experiments with fermentation times or flour blends is, even if most attempts fail. The act of seeking novelty, however small, is what moves fields forward.

This raises a question: How do you judge whether something is “good”? The answer is necessarily subjective, but there’s a pattern. Good new things tend to resonate. They solve problems people didn’t realize they had, or awaken desires they hadn’t felt. The first iPhone was good not just because it worked well, but because it redefined what a phone could be. Goodness here is a combination of utility and surprise—a revelation that this new way is better than the old.

Yet making good new things is inherently risky. Most attempts fail. This is why societies often reward conservatism: it’s safer to repeat what works. But the cost of that safety is stagnation. The people who move the world forward are the ones willing to endure the awkwardness of creating something that might seem, at first, unnecessary or even absurd. The bicycle, the airplane, the internet—all were met with skepticism. Their creators persisted because they sensed a potential others couldn’t yet see.

This is why the principle isn’t “make successful new things.” Success is determined post hoc, by the messy interplay of luck and judgment. The imperative is to try. The act of creation itself is a form of optimism. It’s a bet that the future can be better, and that you can contribute to shaping it. Even failed experiments add to the collective knowledge of what’s possible. The Wright brothers’ glider crashes were as crucial as their eventual flight.

There’s also a moral dimension. To make good new things is to give others tools to improve their lives. A new scientific theory, a piece of software, a farming technique—each amplifies human capability. But this requires a certain humility. The best creators don’t assume they know what people need; they observe, experiment, and iterate. The user, the audience, the citizen—they are the ultimate judges. Making good new things isn’t about imposing your vision on the world, but offering a gift the world can choose to embrace.

What if your work isn’t “impressive” by conventional standards? The answer depends on your audience. A child’s first drawing might be a masterpiece to their parent. A local open-source tool might transform a small community. The scale doesn’t diminish the act. The point is to push beyond what’s been done before, in your context, with your resources. Not everyone can be Newton, but everyone can contribute to the fractal edge of human innovation.

So the answer to “What should one do?” isn’t just to help others or steward the planet, though those are vital. It’s also to build, to tinker, to imagine. To leave the world slightly more interesting, more useful, more beautiful than you found it. The universe tends toward entropy; humans defy it by creating islands of order. Each good new thing, however small, is a protest against stagnation. It’s a whisper that says, “We are not done yet.”
