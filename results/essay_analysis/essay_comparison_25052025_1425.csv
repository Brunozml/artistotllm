A Project Of Ones Own,a_project_of_ones_own,2480,data/PG_sample/processed/a_project_of_ones_own.txt,"June 2021A few days ago, on the way home from school, my nine year old son told me he couldn't wait to get home to write more of the story he was working on. This made me as happy as anything I've heard him say — not just because he was excited about his story, but because he'd discovered this way of working. Working on a project of your own is as different from ordinary work as skating is from walking. It's more fun, but also much more productive.What proportion of great work has been done by people who were skating in this sense? If not all of it, certainly a lot.There is something special about working on a project of your own. I wouldn't say exactly that you're happier. A better word would be excited, or engaged. You're happy when things are going well, but often they aren't. When I'm writing an essay, most of the time I'm worried and puzzled: worried that the essay will turn out badly, and puzzled because I'm groping for some idea that I can't see clearly enough. Will I be able to pin it down with words? In the end I usually can, if I take long enough, but I'm never sure; the first few attempts often fail.You have moments of happiness when things work out, but they don't last long, because then you're on to the next problem. So why do it at all? Because to the kind of people who like working this way, nothing else feels as right. You feel as if you're an animal in its natural habitat, doing what you were meant to do — not always happy, maybe, but awake and alive.Many kids experience the excitement of working on projects of their own. The hard part is making this converge with the work you do as an adult. And our customs make it harder. We treat ""playing"" and ""hobbies"" as qualitatively different from ""work"". It's not clear to a kid building a treehouse that there's a direct (though long) route from that to architecture or engineering. And instead of pointing out the route, we conceal it, by implicitly treating the stuff kids do as different from real work. [1]Instead of telling kids that their treehouses could be on the path to the work they do as adults, we tell them the path goes through school. And unfortunately schoolwork tends to be very different from working on projects of one's own. It's usually neither a project, nor one's own. So as school gets more serious, working on projects of one's own is something that survives, if at all, as a thin thread off to the side.It's a bit sad to think of all the high school kids turning their backs on building treehouses and sitting in class dutifully learning about Darwin or Newton to pass some exam, when the work that made Darwin and Newton famous was actually closer in spirit to building treehouses than studying for exams.If...","...I had to choose between my kids getting good grades and working on ambitious projects of their own, I'd pick the projects. And not because I'm an indulgent parent, but because I've been on the other end and I know which has more predictive value. When I was picking startups for Y Combinator, I didn't care about applicants' grades. But if they'd worked on projects of their own, I wanted to hear all about those. [2]It may be inevitable that school is the way it is. I'm not saying we have to redesign it (though I'm not saying we don't), just that we should understand what it does to our attitudes to work — that it steers us toward the dutiful plodding kind of work, often using competition as bait, and away from skating.There are occasionally times when schoolwork becomes a project of one's own. Whenever I had to write a paper, that would become a project of my own — except in English classes, ironically, because the things one has to write in English classes are so bogus. And when I got to college and started taking CS classes, the programs I had to write became projects of my own. Whenever I was writing or programming, I was usually skating, and that has been true ever since.So where exactly is the edge of projects of one's own? That's an interesting question, partly because the answer is so complicated, and partly because there's so much at stake. There turn out to be two senses in which work can be one's own: 1) that you're doing it voluntarily, rather than merely because someone told you to, and 2) that you're doing it by yourself.The edge of the former is quite sharp. People who care a lot about their work are usually very sensitive to the difference between pulling, and being pushed, and work tends to fall into one category or the other. But the test isn't simply whether you're told to do something. You can choose to do something you're told to do. Indeed, you can own it far more thoroughly than the person who told you to do it.For example, math homework is for most people something they're told to do. But for my father, who was a mathematician, it wasn't. Most of us think of the problems in a math book as a way to test or develop our knowledge of the material explained in each section. But to my father the problems were the part that mattered, and the text was merely a sort of annotation. Whenever he got a new math book it was to him like being given a puzzle: here was a new set of problems to solve, and he'd immediately set about solving all of them.The other sense of a project being one's own — working on it by oneself — has a much softer edge. It shades gradually into collaboration. And interestingly, it shades into collaboration in two different ways. One way to...",Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,data/PG_sample/generated/a_project_of_ones_own_generated.txt,"......the trees that grew from the very same earth that nourished those pioneers. The notion that building treehouses is somehow less worthy of our attention than the scientific discoveries of Darwin and Newton is a curious one, and one that I find particularly disheartening. It's a notion that speaks to a deeper cultural bias, one that treats the work of children as somehow less valuable or less worthy than the work of adults.

But what if I told you that this bias is not unique to our society? What if I told you that there are countless cultures around the world where children are encouraged to build and create, and that these activities are not seen as somehow less worthy than the work of adults? In many indigenous cultures, for example, children are taught from a young age to build and create, and these activities are seen as essential to their development and well-being.

And yet, in our own culture, we often treat these activities as somehow secondary or inferior to the work of adults. We tell children that they should focus on their studies, and that building treehouses is somehow a waste of time. But what if I told you that this is not just a matter of cultural bias? What if I told you that this is a matter of economics? What if I told you that the value of a child's work is not measured by its productivity or its utility, but by its potential to contribute to the greater good?

In many parts of the world, children are not paid for their work, and yet they are expected to contribute to the well-being of their communities. They are expected to build homes, to create art, and to develop skills that will benefit them and their families for generations to come. And yet, in our own culture, we often treat these activities as somehow less valuable than the work of adults.

It's a sad state of affairs, and one that I believe we can do better. We need to recognize that children's work is not somehow less valuable or less worthy than the work of adults. We need to recognize that building treehouses, or creating art, or developing skills is an essential part of a child's development, and that it should be valued and respected in the same way that the work of adults is valued and respected.

But how do we do this? How do we change our cultural norms and our economic systems to recognize the value of children's work? It won't be easy, and it won't be quick. But I believe that it is possible, and that it is essential that we try. Because if we don't, we risk losing the very things that make us human. We risk losing the creativity, the imagination, and the potential that lies within every child.",478,25-05-2025,Comparison of a_project_of_ones_own,0.1652,0.2622,0.9593,0.9808,0.8564,21.26,0.9381,19.41,0.9276,0.9879
After Credentials,after_credentials,2334,data/PG_sample/processed/after_credentials.txt,"December 2008A few months ago I read a New York Times article on South Korean cram schools that said Admission to the right university can make or break an ambitious young South Korean. A parent added: ""In our country, college entrance exams determine 70 to 80 percent of a person's future."" It was striking how old fashioned this sounded. And yet when I was in high school it wouldn't have seemed too far off as a description of the US. Which means things must have been changing here.The course of people's lives in the US now seems to be determined less by credentials and more by performance than it was 25 years ago. Where you go to college still matters, but not like it used to.What happened?_____Judging people by their academic credentials was in its time an advance. The practice seems to have begun in China, where starting in 587 candidates for the imperial civil service had to take an exam on classical literature. [1] It was also a test of wealth, because the knowledge it tested was so specialized that passing required years of expensive training. But though wealth was a necessary condition for passing, it was not a sufficient one. By the standards of the rest of the world in 587, the Chinese system was very enlightened. Europeans didn't introduce formal civil service exams till the nineteenth century, and even then they seem to have been influenced by the Chinese example.Before credentials, government positions were obtained mainly by family influence, if not outright bribery. It was a great step forward to judge people by their performance on a test. But by no means a perfect solution. When you judge people that way, you tend to get cram schools—which they did in Ming China and nineteenth century England just as much as in present day South Korea.What cram schools are, in effect, is leaks in a seal. The use of credentials was an attempt to seal off the direct transmission of power between generations, and cram schools represent that power finding holes in the seal. Cram schools turn wealth in one generation into credentials in the next.It's hard to beat this phenomenon, because the schools adjust to suit whatever the tests measure. When the tests are narrow and predictable, you get cram schools on the classic model, like those that prepared candidates for Sandhurst (the British West Point) or the classes American students take now to improve their SAT scores. But as the tests get broader, the schools do too. Preparing a candidate for the Chinese imperial civil service exams took years, as prep school does today. But the raison d'etre of all these institutions has been the same: to beat the system. [2]_____History suggests that, all other things being equal, a society prospers in proportion to its ability to prevent parents from influencing their children's success directly. It's a fine thing for parents to help their children indirectly—for example, by helping them to become smarter or more disciplined,...","...which then makes them more successful. The problem comes when parents use direct methods: when they are able to use their own wealth or power as a substitute for their children's qualities.Parents will tend to do this when they can. Parents will die for their kids, so it's not surprising to find they'll also push their scruples to the limits for them. Especially if other parents are doing it.Sealing off this force has a double advantage. Not only does a society get ""the best man for the job,"" but parents' ambitions are diverted from direct methods to indirect ones—to actually trying to raise their kids well.But we should expect it to be very hard to contain parents' efforts to obtain an unfair advantage for their kids. We're dealing with one of the most powerful forces in human nature. We shouldn't expect naive solutions to work, any more than we'd expect naive solutions for keeping heroin out of a prison to work._____The obvious way to solve the problem is to make credentials better. If the tests a society uses are currently hackable, we can study the way people beat them and try to plug the holes. You can use the cram schools to show you where most of the holes are. They also tell you when you're succeeding in fixing them: when cram schools become less popular.A more general solution would be to push for increased transparency, especially at critical social bottlenecks like college admissions. In the US this process still shows many outward signs of corruption. For example, legacy admissions. The official story is that legacy status doesn't carry much weight, because all it does is break ties: applicants are bucketed by ability, and legacy status is only used to decide between the applicants in the bucket that straddles the cutoff. But what this means is that a university can make legacy status have as much or as little weight as they want, by adjusting the size of the bucket that straddles the cutoff.By gradually chipping away at the abuse of credentials, you could probably make them more airtight. But what a long fight it would be. Especially when the institutions administering the tests don't really want them to be airtight._____Fortunately there's a better way to prevent the direct transmission of power between generations. Instead of trying to make credentials harder to hack, we can also make them matter less.Let's think about what credentials are for. What they are, functionally, is a way of predicting performance. If you could measure actual performance, you wouldn't need them.So why did they even evolve? Why haven't we just been measuring actual performance? Think about where credentialism first appeared: in selecting candidates for large organizations. Individual performance is hard to measure in large organizations, and the harder performance is to measure, the more important it is to predict it. If an organization could immediately and cheaply measure the performance of recruits, they wouldn't need to examine their credentials. They could take everyone and keep...",Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,data/PG_sample/generated/after_credentials_generated.txt,"...But here's the thing: the Chinese system, the one that's been emulated by so many countries, including South Korea, is actually a relic of a bygone era. It's a system that's been in place for centuries, and yet it's still a far cry from the meritocratic, self-selecting system that we're trying to create here in the US. The Chinese system is a great example of how a society can be shaped by its own values and priorities, and how those values can be used to create a system that's designed to produce the results we want. But, as we've seen, that system is not as effective as we thought it would be. It's a system that's been designed to produce results, not to create a meritocracy.

A Students Guide To Startups,a_students_guide_to_startups,6373,data/PG_sample/processed/a_students_guide_to_startups.txt,"Want to start a startup? Get funded by Y Combinator. October 2006(This essay is derived from a talk at MIT.)Till recently graduating seniors had two choices: get a job or go to grad school. I think there will increasingly be a third option: to start your own startup. But how common will that be?I'm sure the default will always be to get a job, but starting a startup could well become as popular as grad school. In the late 90s my professor friends used to complain that they couldn't get grad students, because all the undergrads were going to work for startups. I wouldn't be surprised if that situation returns, but with one difference: this time they'll be starting their own instead of going to work for other people's.The most ambitious students will at this point be asking: Why wait till you graduate? Why not start a startup while you're in college? In fact, why go to college at all? Why not start a startup instead?A year and a half ago I gave a talk where I said that the average age of the founders of Yahoo, Google, and Microsoft was 24, and that if grad students could start startups, why not undergrads? I'm glad I phrased that as a question, because now I can pretend it wasn't merely a rhetorical one. At the time I couldn't imagine why there should be any lower limit for the age of startup founders. Graduation is a bureaucratic change, not a biological one. And certainly there are undergrads as competent technically as most grad students. So why shouldn't undergrads be able to start startups as well as grad students?I now realize that something does change at graduation: you lose a huge excuse for failing. Regardless of how complex your life is, you'll find that everyone else, including your family and friends, will discard all the low bits and regard you as having a single occupation at any given time. If you're in college and have a summer job writing software, you still read as a student. Whereas if you graduate and get a job programming, you'll be instantly regarded by everyone as a programmer.The problem with starting a startup while you're still in school is that there's a built-in escape hatch. If you start a startup in the summer between your junior and senior year, it reads to everyone as a summer job. So if it goes nowhere, big deal; you return to school in the fall with all the other seniors; no one regards you as a failure, because your occupation is student, and you didn't fail at that. Whereas if you start a startup just one year later, after you graduate, as long as you're not accepted to grad school in the fall the startup reads to everyone as your occupation. You're now a startup founder, so you have to do well at that.For nearly everyone, the opinion of one's peers is the most powerful motivator of all—more powerful even than...","...the nominal goal of most startup founders, getting rich. [1] About a month into each funding cycle we have an event called Prototype Day where each startup presents to the others what they've got so far. You might think they wouldn't need any more motivation. They're working on their cool new idea; they have funding for the immediate future; and they're playing a game with only two outcomes: wealth or failure. You'd think that would be motivation enough. And yet the prospect of a demo pushes most of them into a rush of activity.Even if you start a startup explicitly to get rich, the money you might get seems pretty theoretical most of the time. What drives you day to day is not wanting to look bad.You probably can't change that. Even if you could, I don't think you'd want to; someone who really, truly doesn't care what his peers think of him is probably a psychopath. So the best you can do is consider this force like a wind, and set up your boat accordingly. If you know your peers are going to push you in some direction, choose good peers, and position yourself so they push you in a direction you like.Graduation changes the prevailing winds, and those make a difference. Starting a startup is so hard that it's a close call even for the ones that succeed. However high a startup may be flying now, it probably has a few leaves stuck in the landing gear from those trees it barely cleared at the end of the runway. In such a close game, the smallest increase in the forces against you can be enough to flick you over the edge into failure.When we first started Y Combinator we encouraged people to start startups while they were still in college. That's partly because Y Combinator began as a kind of summer program. We've kept the program shape—all of us having dinner together once a week turns out to be a good idea—but we've decided now that the party line should be to tell people to wait till they graduate.Does that mean you can't start a startup in college? Not at all. Sam Altman, the co-founder of Loopt, had just finished his sophomore year when we funded them, and Loopt is probably the most promising of all the startups we've funded so far. But Sam Altman is a very unusual guy. Within about three minutes of meeting him, I remember thinking ""Ah, so this is what Bill Gates must have been like when he was 19.""If it can work to start a startup during college, why do we tell people not to? For the same reason that the probably apocryphal violinist, whenever he was asked to judge someone's playing, would always say they didn't have enough talent to make it as a pro. Succeeding as a musician takes determination as well as talent, so this answer works out to be the right advice for everyone.

But what if that's not enough? What if the most powerful motivator is not the opinion of others, but the opinion of oneself? What if the most compelling reason to start a startup is not to impress others, but to impress oneself? The problem is that the path to self-improvement is not always linear, and the journey to self-discovery can be fraught with uncertainty. But what if that uncertainty is not a weakness, but a strength? What if the uncertainty of the startup journey is not a deterrent, but a catalyst for growth? I've seen it happen to many of my friends, who have started their own startups in college, only to realize that the uncertainty of the journey is not just a challenge, but an opportunity. The uncertainty of the startup journey is not just a matter of whether you'll be successful or not, but whether you'll be able to learn and grow as a person.

Apples Mistake,apples_mistake,2103,data/PG_sample/processed/apples_mistake.txt,"Want to start a startup? Get funded by Y Combinator. November 2009I don't think Apple realizes how badly the App Store approval process is broken. Or rather, I don't think they realize how much it matters that it's broken.The way Apple runs the App Store has harmed their reputation with programmers more than anything else they've ever done. Their reputation with programmers used to be great. It used to be the most common complaint you heard about Apple was that their fans admired them too uncritically. The App Store has changed that. Now a lot of programmers have started to see Apple as evil.How much of the goodwill Apple once had with programmers have they lost over the App Store? A third? Half? And that's just so far. The App Store is an ongoing karma leak.* * *How did Apple get into this mess? Their fundamental problem is that they don't understand software.They treat iPhone apps the way they treat the music they sell through iTunes. Apple is the channel; they own the user; if you want to reach users, you do it on their terms. The record labels agreed, reluctantly. But this model doesn't work for software. It doesn't work for an intermediary to own the user. The software business learned that in the early 1980s, when companies like VisiCorp showed that although the words ""software"" and ""publisher"" fit together, the underlying concepts don't. Software isn't like music or books. It's too complicated for a third party to act as an intermediary between developer and user. And yet that's what Apple is trying to be with the App Store: a software publisher. And a particularly overreaching one at that, with fussy tastes and a rigidly enforced house style.If software publishing didn't work in 1980, it works even less now that software development has evolved from a small number of big releases to a constant stream of small ones. But Apple doesn't understand that either. Their model of product development derives from hardware. They work on something till they think it's finished, then they release it. You have to do that with hardware, but because software is so easy to change, its design can benefit from evolution. The standard way to develop applications now is to launch fast and iterate. Which means it's a disaster to have long, random delays each time you release a new version.Apparently Apple's attitude is that developers should be more careful when they submit a new version to the App Store. They would say that. But powerful as they are, they're not powerful enough to turn back the evolution of technology. Programmers don't use launch-fast-and-iterate out of laziness. They use it because it yields the best results. By obstructing that process, Apple is making them do bad work, and programmers hate that as much as Apple would.How would Apple like it if when they discovered a serious bug in OS X, instead of releasing a software update immediately, they had to submit their code to...","...an intermediary who sat on it for a month and then rejected it because it contained an icon they didn't like?By breaking software development, Apple gets the opposite of what they intended: the version of an app currently available in the App Store tends to be an old and buggy one. One developer told me: As a result of their process, the App Store is full of half-baked applications. I make a new version almost every day that I release to beta users. The version on the App Store feels old and crappy. I'm sure that a lot of developers feel this way: One emotion is ""I'm not really proud about what's in the App Store"", and it's combined with the emotion ""Really, it's Apple's fault."" Another wrote: I believe that they think their approval process helps users by ensuring quality. In reality, bugs like ours get through all the time and then it can take 4-8 weeks to get that bug fix approved, leaving users to think that iPhone apps sometimes just don't work. Worse for Apple, these apps work just fine on other platforms that have immediate approval processes. Actually I suppose Apple has a third misconception: that all the complaints about App Store approvals are not a serious problem. They must hear developers complaining. But partners and suppliers are always complaining. It would be a bad sign if they weren't; it would mean you were being too easy on them. Meanwhile the iPhone is selling better than ever. So why do they need to fix anything?They get away with maltreating developers, in the short term, because they make such great hardware. I just bought a new 27"" iMac a couple days ago. It's fabulous. The screen's too shiny, and the disk is surprisingly loud, but it's so beautiful that you can't make yourself care.So I bought it, but I bought it, for the first time, with misgivings. I felt the way I'd feel buying something made in a country with a bad human rights record. That was new. In the past when I bought things from Apple it was an unalloyed pleasure. Oh boy! They make such great stuff. This time it felt like a Faustian bargain. They make such great stuff, but they're such assholes. Do I really want to support this company?* * *Should Apple care what people like me think? What difference does it make if they alienate a small minority of their users?There are a couple reasons they should care. One is that these users are the people they want as employees. If your company seems evil, the best programmers won't work for you. That hurt Microsoft a lot starting in the 90s. Programmers started to feel sheepish about working there. It seemed like selling out. When people from Microsoft were talking to other programmers and they mentioned where they worked, there were a lot of self-deprecating jokes about having gone over to the dark side. But the real problem for Microsoft wasn't...",Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,data/PG_sample/generated/apples_mistake_generated.txt,"...* * *The Apple bug is a classic example of the fundamental flaw in their approach to software development. If they had to submit their code to the App Store, it would be a monumental task, not just because of the sheer volume of updates they need to release, but also because of the sheer complexity of the codebase. The fact that they can't even be bothered to submit their code to the App Store is a testament to their arrogance.* * *But what's even more disturbing is that this is not just a matter of Apple's incompetence. It's a symptom of a deeper problem: their fundamental misunderstanding of the software business. They think that by treating iPhone apps like music through iTunes, they can somehow magically create a seamless user experience. But the truth is, software is a fundamentally different beast from music or books. It's a complex, dynamic system that requires constant iteration and evolution.* * *And yet, Apple continues to cling to this outdated model, refusing to adapt to the changing landscape of the software business. They're like a ship that's been stuck in the mud for decades, refusing to change course even when the world around them is moving on.* * *The problem is, this is not just a matter of Apple's internal culture.

""Assholes,"" he says.But lately I've been learning more about how the VC world works, and a few days ago it hit me that there's a reason VCs are the way they are. It's not so much that the business attracts jerks, or even that the power they wield corrupts them. The real problem is the way they're paid.The problem with VC funds is that they're funds. Like the managers of mutual funds or hedge funds, VCs get paid a percentage of the money they manage: about 2% a year in management fees, plus a percentage of the gains. So they want the fund to be huge-- hundreds of millions of dollars, if possible. But that means each partner ends up being responsible for investing a lot of money. And since one person can only manage so many deals, each deal has to be for multiple millions of dollars.This turns out to explain nearly all the characteristics of VCs that founders hate.It explains why VCs take so agonizingly long to make up their minds, and why their due diligence feels like a body cavity search. [2] With so much at stake, they have to be paranoid.It explains why they steal your ideas. Every founder knows that VCs will tell your secrets to your competitors if they end up investing in them. It's not unheard of for VCs to meet you when they have no intention of funding you, just to pick your brain for a competitor. This prospect makes naive founders clumsily secretive. Experienced founders treat it as a cost of doing business. Either way it sucks. But again, the only reason VCs are so sneaky is the giant deals they do. With so much at stake, they have to be devious.It explains why VCs tend to interfere in the companies they invest in. They want to be on your board not just so that they can advise you, but so that they can watch you. Often they even install a new CEO. Yes, he may have extensive business experience. But he's also their man: these newly installed CEOs always play something of the role of a political commissar in a Red Army unit. With so much at stake, VCs can't resist micromanaging you.The huge investments themselves are something founders would dislike, if they realized how damaging they can be. VCs don't invest...","...$x million because that's the amount you need, but because that's the amount the structure of their business requires them to invest. Like steroids, these sudden huge investments can do more harm than good. Google survived enormous VC funding because it could legitimately absorb large amounts of money. They had to buy a lot of servers and a lot of bandwidth to crawl the whole Web. Less fortunate startups just end up hiring armies of people to sit around having meetings.In principle you could take a huge VC investment, put it in treasury bills, and continue to operate frugally. You just try it.And of course giant investments mean giant valuations. They have to, or there's not enough stock left to keep the founders interested. You might think a high valuation is a great thing. Many founders do. But you can't eat paper. You can't benefit from a high valuation unless you can somehow achieve what those in the business call a ""liquidity event,"" and the higher your valuation, the narrower your options for doing that. Many a founder would be happy to sell his company for $15 million, but VCs who've just invested at a pre-money valuation of $8 million won't hear of that. You're rolling the dice again, whether you like it or not.Back in 1997, one of our competitors raised $20 million in a single round of VC funding. This was at the time more than the valuation of our entire company. Was I worried? Not at all: I was delighted. It was like watching a car you're chasing turn down a street that you know has no outlet.Their smartest move at that point would have been to take every penny of the $20 million and use it to buy us. We would have sold. Their investors would have been furious of course. But I think the main reason they never considered this was that they never imagined we could be had so cheap. They probably assumed we were on the same VC gravy train they were.In fact we only spent about $2 million in our entire existence. And that gave us flexibility. We could sell ourselves to Yahoo for $50 million, and everyone was delighted. If our competitor had done that, the last round of investors would presumably have lost money. I assume they could have vetoed such a deal. But no one those days was paying a lot more than Yahoo. So unless their founders could pull off an IPO (which would be difficult with Yahoo as a competitor), they had no choice but to ride the thing down.The puffed-up companies that went public during the Bubble didn't do it just because they were pulled into it by unscrupulous investment bankers. Most were pushed just as hard from the other side by VCs who'd invested at high valuations, leaving an IPO as the only way out. The only people dumber were retail investors. So it was literally IPO or bust. Or rather, IPO then bust, or...",Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,data/PG_sample/generated/a_unified_theory_of_vc_suckage_generated.txt,"......in the company itself, but rather in the ""idea"" that the company is going to make. They're essentially betting on the idea, rather than the company. This is why VCs are so willing to take on huge risks, even if the company is still in its infancy. It's a classic case of ""I'll take a chance on a crazy idea because I'm a visionary, not because I have a clear understanding of the market."" This is why VCs are often willing to overlook fundamental flaws in a company's business plan, as long as they believe in the idea behind it. It's a classic example of the ""visionary investor"" phenomenon, where the investor is more interested in the idea than in the actual company. This is why VCs often have a tendency to ""disrupt"" companies that are already successful, simply because they believe in the idea behind the disruption. It's a classic case of ""I'll take a chance on a new idea because I'm a visionary, not because I have a clear understanding of the market.""",175,25-05-2025,Comparison of a_unified_theory_of_vc_suckage,0.1312,0.1614,0.9422,0.9536,0.6719,20.44,0.9793,14.03,0.8645,0.9938
A New Venture Animal,a_new_venture_animal,1961,data/PG_sample/processed/a_new_venture_animal.txt,"March 2008, rev May 2013(This essay grew out of something I wrote for myself to figure out what we do. Even though Y Combinator is now 3 years old, we're still trying to understand its implications.) I was annoyed recently to read a description of Y Combinator that said ""Y Combinator does seed funding for startups."" What was especially annoying about it was that I wrote it. This doesn't really convey what we do. And the reason it's inaccurate is that, paradoxically, funding very early stage startups is not mainly about funding.Saying YC does seed funding for startups is a description in terms of earlier models. It's like calling a car a horseless carriage.When you scale animals you can't just keep everything in proportion. For example, volume grows as the cube of linear dimension, but surface area only as the square. So as animals get bigger they have trouble radiating heat. That's why mice and rabbits are furry and elephants and hippos aren't. You can't make a mouse by scaling down an elephant.YC represents a new, smaller kind of animal—so much smaller that all the rules are different.Before us, most companies in the startup funding business were venture capital funds. VCs generally fund later stage companies than we do. And they supply so much money that, even though the other things they do may be very valuable, it's not that inaccurate to regard VCs as sources of money. Good VCs are ""smart money,"" but they're still money.All good investors supply a combination of money and help. But these scale differently, just as volume and surface area do. Late stage investors supply huge amounts of money and comparatively little help: when a company about to go public gets a mezzanine round of $50 million, the deal tends to be almost entirely about money. As you move earlier in the venture funding process, the ratio of help to money increases, because earlier stage companies have different needs. Early stage companies need less money because they're smaller and cheaper to run, but they need more help because life is so precarious for them. So when VCs do a series A round for, say, $2 million, they generally expect to offer a significant amount of help along with the money.Y Combinator occupies the earliest end of the spectrum. We're at least one and generally two steps before VC funding. (Though some startups go straight from YC to VC, the most common trajectory is to do an angel round first.) And what happens at Y Combinator is as different from what happens in a series A round as a series A round is from a mezzanine financing.At our end, money is almost a negligible factor. The startup usually consists of just the founders. Their living expenses are the company's main expense, and since most founders are under 30, their living expenses are low. But at this early stage companies need a lot of help. Practically every question is still unanswered. Some companies we've funded have...","...been working on their software for a year or more, but others haven't decided what to work on, or even who the founders should be.When PR people and journalists recount the histories of startups after they've become big, they always underestimate how uncertain things were at first. They're not being deliberately misleading. When you look at a company like Google, it's hard to imagine they could once have been small and helpless. Sure, at one point they were a just a couple guys in a garage—but even then their greatness was assured, and all they had to do was roll forward along the railroad tracks of destiny.Far from it. A lot of startups with just as promising beginnings end up failing. Google has such momentum now that it would be hard for anyone to stop them. But all it would have taken in the beginning would have been for two Google employees to focus on the wrong things for six months, and the company could have died.We know, because we've been there, just how vulnerable startups are in the earliest phases. Curiously enough, that's why founders tend to get so rich from them. Reward is always proportionate to risk, and very early stage startups are insanely risky.What we really do at Y Combinator is get startups launched straight. One of many metaphors you could use for YC is a steam catapult on an aircraft carrier. We get startups airborne. Barely airborne, but enough that they can accelerate fast.When you're launching planes they have to be set up properly or you're just launching projectiles. They have to be pointed straight down the deck; the wings have to be trimmed properly; the engines have to be at full power; the pilot has to be ready. These are the kind of problems we deal with. After we fund startups we work closely with them for three months—so closely in fact that we insist they move to where we are. And what we do in those three months is make sure everything is set up for launch. If there are tensions between cofounders we help sort them out. We get all the paperwork set up properly so there are no nasty surprises later. If the founders aren't sure what to focus on first, we try to figure that out. If there is some obstacle right in front of them, we either try to remove it, or shift the startup sideways. The goal is to get every distraction out of the way so the founders can use that time to build (or finish building) something impressive. And then near the end of the three months we push the button on the steam catapult in the form of Demo Day, where the current group of startups present to pretty much every investor in Silicon Valley.Launching companies isn't identical with launching products. Though we do spend a lot of time on launch strategies for products, there are some things that take too long to build for a...",Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,data/PG_sample/generated/a_new_venture_animal_generated.txt,"...The fundamental flaw in the description of Y Combinator as a seed funding program is that it's a misnomer. The fact that we're at least two steps before VC funding is a testament to the fact that we're not just a seed program, but a bridge between the early stages of entrepreneurship and the later stages of investment. It's a mistake to imply that we're just a seed program, when in fact we're a catalyst for the next stage of investment.",81,25-05-2025,Comparison of a_new_venture_animal,0.1235,0.144,0.943,0.9341,0.5304,29.0,0.8612,17.86,0.7747,0.9865
A Fundraising Survival Guide,a_fundraising_survival_guide,4754,data/PG_sample/processed/a_fundraising_survival_guide.txt,"Want to start a startup? Get funded by Y Combinator. August 2008Raising money is the second hardest part of starting a startup. The hardest part is making something people want: most startups that die, die because they didn't do that. But the second biggest cause of death is probably the difficulty of raising money. Fundraising is brutal.One reason it's so brutal is simply the brutality of markets. People who've spent most of their lives in schools or big companies may not have been exposed to that. Professors and bosses usually feel some sense of responsibility toward you; if you make a valiant effort and fail, they'll cut you a break. Markets are less forgiving. Customers don't care how hard you worked, only whether you solved their problems.Investors evaluate startups the way customers evaluate products, not the way bosses evaluate employees. If you're making a valiant effort and failing, maybe they'll invest in your next startup, but not this one.But raising money from investors is harder than selling to customers, because there are so few of them. There's nothing like an efficient market. You're unlikely to have more than 10 who are interested; it's difficult to talk to more. So the randomness of any one investor's behavior can really affect you.Problem number 3: investors are very random. All investors, including us, are by ordinary standards incompetent. We constantly have to make decisions about things we don't understand, and more often than not we're wrong.And yet a lot is at stake. The amounts invested by different types of investors vary from five thousand dollars to fifty million, but the amount usually seems large for whatever type of investor it is. Investment decisions are big decisions.That combination—making big decisions about things they don't understand—tends to make investors very skittish. VCs are notorious for leading founders on. Some of the more unscrupulous do it deliberately. But even the most well-intentioned investors can behave in a way that would seem crazy in everyday life. One day they're full of enthusiasm and seem ready to write you a check on the spot; the next they won't return your phone calls. They're not playing games with you. They just can't make up their minds. [1]If that weren't bad enough, these wildly fluctuating nodes are all linked together. Startup investors all know one another, and (though they hate to admit it) the biggest factor in their opinion of you is the opinion of other investors. [2] Talk about a recipe for an unstable system. You get the opposite of the damping that the fear/greed balance usually produces in markets. No one is interested in a startup that's a ""bargain"" because everyone else hates it.So the inefficient market you get because there are so few players is exacerbated by the fact that they act less than independently. The result is a system like some kind of primitive, multi-celled sea creature, where you irritate one extremity and the whole thing contracts violently.Y Combinator is working to fix this. We're trying...","...to increase the number of investors just as we're increasing the number of startups. We hope that as the number of both increases we'll get something more like an efficient market. As t approaches infinity, Demo Day approaches an auction.Unfortunately, t is still very far from infinity. What does a startup do now, in the imperfect world we currently inhabit? The most important thing is not to let fundraising get you down. Startups live or die on morale. If you let the difficulty of raising money destroy your morale, it will become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Bootstrapping (= Consulting)Some would-be founders may by now be thinking, why deal with investors at all? If raising money is so painful, why do it?One answer to that is obvious: because you need money to live on. It's a fine idea in principle to finance your startup with its own revenues, but you can't create instant customers. Whatever you make, you have to sell a certain amount to break even. It will take time to grow your sales to that point, and it's hard to predict, till you try, how long it will take.We could not have bootstrapped Viaweb, for example. We charged quite a lot for our software—about $140 per user per month—but it was at least a year before our revenues would have covered even our paltry costs. We didn't have enough saved to live on for a year.If you factor out the ""bootstrapped"" companies that were actually funded by their founders through savings or a day job, the remainder either (a) got really lucky, which is hard to do on demand, or (b) began life as consulting companies and gradually transformed themselves into product companies.Consulting is the only option you can count on. But consulting is far from free money. It's not as painful as raising money from investors, perhaps, but the pain is spread over a longer period. Years, probably. And for many types of startup, that delay could be fatal. If you're working on something so unusual that no one else is likely to think of it, you can take your time. Joshua Schachter gradually built Delicious on the side while working on Wall Street. He got away with it because no one else realized it was a good idea. But if you were building something as obviously necessary as online store software at about the same time as Viaweb, and you were working on it on the side while spending most of your time on client work, you were not in a good position.Bootstrapping sounds great in principle, but this apparently verdant territory is one from which few startups emerge alive. The mere fact that bootstrapped startups tend to be famous on that account should set off alarm bells. If it worked so well, it would be the norm. [3] Bootstrapping may get easier, because starting a company is getting cheaper. But I don't think we'll ever reach the point where most startups can do without outside funding.

A Plan For Spam,a_plan_for_spam,5237,data/PG_sample/processed/a_plan_for_spam.txt,"Like to build things? Try Hacker News. August 2002(This article describes the spam-filtering techniques used in the spamproof web-based mail reader we built to exercise Arc. An improved algorithm is described in Better Bayesian Filtering.)I think it's possible to stop spam, and that content-based filters are the way to do it. The Achilles heel of the spammers is their message. They can circumvent any other barrier you set up. They have so far, at least. But they have to deliver their message, whatever it is. If we can write software that recognizes their messages, there is no way they can get around that._ _ _To the recipient, spam is easily recognizable. If you hired someone to read your mail and discard the spam, they would have little trouble doing it. How much do we have to do, short of AI, to automate this process?I think we will be able to solve the problem with fairly simple algorithms. In fact, I've found that you can filter present-day spam acceptably well using nothing more than a Bayesian combination of the spam probabilities of individual words. Using a slightly tweaked (as described below) Bayesian filter, we now miss less than 5 per 1000 spams, with 0 false positives.The statistical approach is not usually the first one people try when they write spam filters. Most hackers' first instinct is to try to write software that recognizes individual properties of spam. You look at spams and you think, the gall of these guys to try sending me mail that begins ""Dear Friend"" or has a subject line that's all uppercase and ends in eight exclamation points. I can filter out that stuff with about one line of code.And so you do, and in the beginning it works. A few simple rules will take a big bite out of your incoming spam. Merely looking for the word ""click"" will catch 79.7% of the emails in my spam corpus, with only 1.2% false positives.I spent about six months writing software that looked for individual spam features before I tried the statistical approach. What I found was that recognizing that last few percent of spams got very hard, and that as I made the filters stricter I got more false positives.False positives are innocent emails that get mistakenly identified as spams. For most users, missing legitimate email is an order of magnitude worse than receiving spam, so a filter that yields false positives is like an acne cure that carries a risk of death to the patient.The more spam a user gets, the less likely he'll be to notice one innocent mail sitting in his spam folder. And strangely enough, the better your spam filters get, the more dangerous false positives become, because when the filters are really good, users will be more likely to ignore everything they catch.I don't know why I avoided trying the statistical approach for so long. I think it was because I got addicted to trying to identify spam features myself, as if...","...I were playing some kind of competitive game with the spammers. (Nonhackers don't often realize this, but most hackers are very competitive.) When I did try statistical analysis, I found immediately that it was much cleverer than I had been. It discovered, of course, that terms like ""virtumundo"" and ""teens"" were good indicators of spam. But it also discovered that ""per"" and ""FL"" and ""ff0000"" are good indicators of spam. In fact, ""ff0000"" (html for bright red) turns out to be as good an indicator of spam as any pornographic term._ _ _Here's a sketch of how I do statistical filtering. I start with one corpus of spam and one of nonspam mail. At the moment each one has about 4000 messages in it. I scan the entire text, including headers and embedded html and javascript, of each message in each corpus. I currently consider alphanumeric characters, dashes, apostrophes, and dollar signs to be part of tokens, and everything else to be a token separator. (There is probably room for improvement here.) I ignore tokens that are all digits, and I also ignore html comments, not even considering them as token separators.I count the number of times each token (ignoring case, currently) occurs in each corpus. At this stage I end up with two large hash tables, one for each corpus, mapping tokens to number of occurrences.Next I create a third hash table, this time mapping each token to the probability that an email containing it is a spam, which I calculate as follows [1]: (let ((g (* 2 (or (gethash word good) 0))) (b (or (gethash word bad) 0))) (unless (< (+ g b) 5) (max .01 (min .99 (float (/ (min 1 (/ b nbad)) (+ (min 1 (/ g ngood)) (min 1 (/ b nbad))))))))) where word is the token whose probability we're calculating, good and bad are the hash tables I created in the first step, and ngood and nbad are the number of nonspam and spam messages respectively.I explained this as code to show a couple of important details. I want to bias the probabilities slightly to avoid false positives, and by trial and error I've found that a good way to do it is to double all the numbers in good. This helps to distinguish between words that occasionally do occur in legitimate email and words that almost never do. I only consider words that occur more than five times in total (actually, because of the doubling, occurring three times in nonspam mail would be enough). And then there is the question of what probability to assign to words that occur in one corpus but not the other. Again by trial and error I chose .01 and .99. There may be room for tuning here, but as the corpus grows such tuning will happen automatically anyway.The especially observant will notice that while I consider each corpus to be a single long stream of text for purposes of counting occurrences, I use the number of...",Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,data/PG_sample/generated/a_plan_for_spam_generated.txt,"......the solution to the problem was out there, waiting to be discovered. I had always been fascinated by the idea of creating software that could recognize and filter out spam, and I spent countless hours poring over lines of code, tweaking and testing different algorithms. But as I delved deeper into the world of spam filtering, I began to realize that the problem was not just about identifying individual spam features, but about understanding the underlying psychology of the spammers.

I started to wonder: what is it about the spammers that makes them so effective? What is it about their messages that allows them to evade even the most sophisticated filters? And what is the nature of the relationship between the spammers and their audience? Is it a simple case of ""I'm a spammer, and I'm going to send you this email anyway""? Or is there something more complex at play?

As I dug deeper, I began to realize that the answer to these questions was not just a matter of technical wizardry, but of understanding the human condition. I started to think about the ways in which people interact with each other, and how they respond to different types of messages. I began to see that the spammers were not just trying to send emails, they were trying to create a sense of connection with their audience.

And so, I turned my attention to the art of persuasion. I realized that the key to effective spam filtering was not just about identifying spam features, but about understanding the psychology of the spammers. I began to study the art of persuasion, and I discovered that the most effective spam filters were not just about blocking emails, but about creating a sense of trust and connection with the recipient.

But as I delved deeper into this new area of research, I began to realize that the line between spam and legitimate email was becoming increasingly blurred. I started to wonder: what is the point of having a spam filter if it's not just about blocking emails, but about creating a sense of connection with the recipient? And what is the nature of the relationship between the spammers and their audience, if it's not just about sending emails, but about creating a sense of trust and connection?

A Local Revolution,a_local_revolution,1318,data/PG_sample/processed/a_local_revolution.txt,"April 2009Recently I realized I'd been holding two ideas in my head that would explode if combined.The first is that startups may represent a new economic phase, on the scale of the Industrial Revolution. I'm not sure of this, but there seems a decent chance it's true. People are dramatically more productive as founders or early employees of startups—imagine how much less Larry and Sergey would have achieved if they'd gone to work for a big company—and that scale of improvement can change social customs.The second idea is that startups are a type of business that flourishes in certain places that specialize in it—that Silicon Valley specializes in startups in the same way Los Angeles specializes in movies, or New York in finance. [1]What if both are true? What if startups are both a new economic phase and also a type of business that only flourishes in certain centers?If so, this revolution is going to be particularly revolutionary. All previous revolutions have spread. Agriculture, cities, and industrialization all spread widely. If startups end up being like the movie business, with just a handful of centers and one dominant one, that's going to have novel consequences.There are already signs that startups may not spread particularly well. The spread of startups seems to be proceeding slower than the spread of the Industrial Revolution, despite the fact that communication is so much faster now.Within a few decades of the founding of Boulton & Watt there were steam engines scattered over northern Europe and North America. Industrialization didn't spread much beyond those regions for a while. It only spread to places where there was a strong middle class—countries where a private citizen could make a fortune without having it confiscated. Otherwise it wasn't worth investing in factories. But in a country with a strong middle class it was easy for industrial techniques to take root. An individual mine or factory owner could decide to install a steam engine, and within a few years he could probably find someone local to make him one. So steam engines spread fast. And they spread widely, because the locations of mines and factories were determined by features like rivers, harbors, and sources of raw materials. [2]Startups don't seem to spread so well, partly because they're more a social than a technical phenomenon, and partly because they're not tied to geography. An individual European manufacturer could import industrial techniques and they'd work fine. This doesn't seem to work so well with startups: you need a community of expertise, as you do in the movie business. [3] Plus there aren't the same forces driving startups to spread. Once railroads or electric power grids were invented, every region had to have them. An area without railroads or power was a rich potential market. But this isn't true with startups.

If I had to predict now, I'd say that startups will spread, but very slowly, because their spread will be driven not by government policies (which won't work) or by market need (which doesn't exist) but, to the extent that it happens at all, by the same random factors that have caused startup culture to spread thus far. And such random factors will increasingly be outweighed by the pull of existing startup hubs.Silicon Valley is where it is because William Shockley wanted to move back to Palo Alto, where he grew up, and the experts he lured west to work with him liked it so much they stayed. Seattle owes much of its position as a tech center to the same cause: Gates and Allen wanted to move home. Otherwise Albuquerque might have Seattle's place in the rankings. Boston is a tech center because it's the intellectual capital of the US and probably the world. And if Battery Ventures hadn't turned down Facebook, Boston would be significantly bigger now on the startup radar screen.But of course it's not a coincidence that Facebook got funded in the Valley and not Boston. There are more and bolder investors in Silicon Valley than in Boston, and even undergrads know it.Boston's case illustrates the difficulty you'd have establishing a new startup hub this late in the game. If you wanted to create a startup hub by reproducing the way existing ones happened, the way to do it would be to establish a first-rate research university in a place so nice that rich people wanted to live there. Then the town would be hospitable to both groups you need: both founders and investors. That's the combination that yielded Silicon Valley. But Silicon Valley didn't have Silicon Valley to compete with. If you tried now to create a startup hub by planting a great university in a nice place, it would have a harder time getting started, because many of the best startups it produced would be sucked away to existing startup hubs.Recently I suggested a potential shortcut: pay startups to move. Once you had enough good startups in one place, it would create a self-sustaining chain reaction. Founders would start to move there without being paid, because that was where their peers were, and investors would appear too, because that was where the deals were.In practice I doubt any government would have the balls to try this, or the brains to do it right. I didn't mean it as a practical suggestion, but more as an exploration of the lower bound of what it would take to create a startup hub deliberately.The most likely scenario is (1) that no government will successfully establish a startup hub, and (2) that the spread of startup culture will thus be driven by the random factors that have driven it so far, but (3) that these factors will be increasingly outweighed by the pull of existing startup hubs. Result: this revolution, if...",Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,data/PG_sample/generated/a_local_revolution_generated.txt,"......revolutionary force can. The fact that governments can't create a Silicon Valley of their own, with a thriving ecosystem of startups and entrepreneurs, is a stark reminder that the seeds of innovation are not sown in the government's backyard, but rather in the minds of individuals and communities. The notion that startups are a type of business that flourishes in certain centers, like Silicon Valley or Los Angeles, is a fascinating one, and one that I'd like to explore further. What if I'm right, and startups are not just a product of geography, but also of culture and community? What if the same forces that drive innovation in one place are not replicated in another? The idea that startups are a type of business that only thrives in certain centers is a compelling one, and one that I'd like to examine in more depth.

Consider the case of the film industry. The same forces that drive the creation of movies in Los Angeles, like the availability of talent, resources, and a thriving film community, are not replicated in other parts of the world. The same is true for music, art, and other creative industries. The fact that the same forces that drive innovation in one place are not replicated in another is a powerful argument for the importance of community and culture in the creation of new ideas.

But what if this is not just a matter of geography and culture? What if there are underlying forces at play that drive innovation in certain places? What if the same forces that drive the creation of startups in Silicon Valley are not unique to that place, but rather are a product of a broader cultural and economic context? The idea that startups are a type of business that flourishes in certain centers is a fascinating one, and one that I'd like to explore further.

One possible explanation for the slow spread of startups is that they are not just a product of geography and culture, but also of technology. The same forces that drive innovation in one place are not replicated in another, and the same is true for the spread of technology. The fact that the same forces that drive the creation of the internet, for example, are not replicated in other parts of the world is a powerful argument for the importance of technology in the creation of new ideas.

But what if this is not just a matter of technology? What if there are underlying forces at play that drive innovation in certain places? What if the same forces that drive the creation of startups in Silicon Valley are not unique to that place, but rather are a product of a broader cultural and economic context? The idea that startups are a type of business that flourishes in certain centers is a fascinating one, and one that I'd like to explore further.

As I see it, the revolution that startups represent is not just a matter of geography and culture, but also of technology and economics.

A Version 10,a_version_10,4222,data/PG_sample/processed/a_version_10.txt,"October 2004 As E. B. White said, ""good writing is rewriting."" I didn't realize this when I was in school. In writing, as in math and science, they only show you the finished product. You don't see all the false starts. This gives students a misleading view of how things get made.Part of the reason it happens is that writers don't want people to see their mistakes. But I'm willing to let people see an early draft if it will show how much you have to rewrite to beat an essay into shape.Below is the oldest version I can find of The Age of the Essay (probably the second or third day), with text that ultimately survived in red and text that later got deleted in gray. There seem to be several categories of cuts: things I got wrong, things that seem like bragging, flames, digressions, stretches of awkward prose, and unnecessary words.I discarded more from the beginning. That's not surprising; it takes a while to hit your stride. There are more digressions at the start, because I'm not sure where I'm heading.The amount of cutting is about average. I probably write three to four words for every one that appears in the final version of an essay.(Before anyone gets mad at me for opinions expressed here, remember that anything you see here that's not in the final version is obviously something I chose not to publish, often because I disagree with it.) Recently a friend said that what he liked about my essays was that they weren't written the way we'd been taught to write essays in school. You remember: topic sentence, introductory paragraph, supporting paragraphs, conclusion. It hadn't occurred to me till then that those horrible things we had to write in school were even connected to what I was doing now. But sure enough, I thought, they did call them ""essays,"" didn't they?Well, they're not. Those things you have to write in school are not only not essays, they're one of the most pointless of all the pointless hoops you have to jump through in school. And I worry that they not only teach students the wrong things about writing, but put them off writing entirely.So I'm going to give the other side of the story: what an essay really is, and how you write one. Or at least, how I write one. Students be forewarned: if you actually write the kind of essay I describe, you'll probably get bad grades. But knowing how it's really done should at least help you to understand the feeling of futility you have when you're writing the things they tell you to. The most obvious difference between real essays and the things one has to write in school is that real essays are not exclusively about English literature. It's a fine thing for schools to teach students how to write. But for some bizarre reason (actually, a very specific bizarre reason that I'll explain in a moment), the teaching of...","...writing has gotten mixed together with the study of literature. And so all over the country, students are writing not about how a baseball team with a small budget might compete with the Yankees, or the role of color in fashion, or what constitutes a good dessert, but about symbolism in Dickens.With obvious results. Only a few people really care about symbolism in Dickens. The teacher doesn't. The students don't. Most of the people who've had to write PhD disserations about Dickens don't. And certainly Dickens himself would be more interested in an essay about color or baseball.How did things get this way? To answer that we have to go back almost a thousand years. Between about 500 and 1000, life was not very good in Europe. The term ""dark ages"" is presently out of fashion as too judgemental (the period wasn't dark; it was just different), but if this label didn't already exist, it would seem an inspired metaphor. What little original thought there was took place in lulls between constant wars and had something of the character of the thoughts of parents with a new baby. The most amusing thing written during this period, Liudprand of Cremona's Embassy to Constantinople, is, I suspect, mostly inadvertantly so.Around 1000 Europe began to catch its breath. And once they had the luxury of curiosity, one of the first things they discovered was what we call ""the classics."" Imagine if we were visited by aliens. If they could even get here they'd presumably know a few things we don't. Immediately Alien Studies would become the most dynamic field of scholarship: instead of painstakingly discovering things for ourselves, we could simply suck up everything they'd discovered. So it was in Europe in 1200. When classical texts began to circulate in Europe, they contained not just new answers, but new questions. (If anyone proved a theorem in christian Europe before 1200, for example, there is no record of it.)For a couple centuries, some of the most important work being done was intellectual archaelogy. Those were also the centuries during which schools were first established. And since reading ancient texts was the essence of what scholars did then, it became the basis of the curriculum.By 1700, someone who wanted to learn about physics didn't need to start by mastering Greek in order to read Aristotle. But schools change slower than scholarship: the study of ancient texts had such prestige that it remained the backbone of education until the late 19th century. By then it was merely a tradition. It did serve some purposes: reading a foreign language was difficult, and thus taught discipline, or at least, kept students busy; it introduced students to cultures quite different from their own; and its very uselessness made it function (like white gloves) as a social bulwark. But it certainly wasn't true, and hadn't been true for centuries, that students were serving apprenticeships in the hottest area of scholarship.Classical scholarship had also changed. In the early era, philology actually...",Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,data/PG_sample/generated/a_version_10_generated.txt,"......the teaching of the ""art of essay writing"" seems to be a misguided endeavor. It's a peculiar notion that the key to writing a good essay lies in mastering the intricacies of literary theory and the nuances of rhetorical devices. But what's truly fascinating is how this fixation on the ""art of essay writing"" has led to a stifling of creativity and a stifling of the very essence of writing itself. As I've come to realize, the most compelling essays are those that are unapologetically raw, unbridled, and unafraid to take risks. They're not concerned with pleasing the masses or conforming to some arbitrary set of rules; they're concerned with telling the truth, with being honest, and with being true to themselves.

And yet, despite this, the teaching of essay writing often seems to prioritize the artifice of language over the substance of thought. It's a strange paradox, really – the more you're taught to write like an essay, the more you're discouraged from writing like yourself. It's as if the very act of writing is being reduced to a series of formulaic, pseudo-intellectual exercises, rather than a genuine expression of the human experience.

I recall a conversation I had with a colleague, who was struggling to come up with a topic for an essay. He was stuck, unable to think of anything that would interest him or engage his readers. And then, I told him, ""Just write about something that bothers you."" At first, he was skeptical – what could possibly be interesting about his own life? But then, something strange happened. He began to write, and the words flowed out of him like water. It was raw, it was honest, and it was unapologetically himself.

That's the kind of writing I'm talking about – writing that's unencumbered by the constraints of traditional essay writing. Writing that's not afraid to take risks, to challenge the status quo, and to push the boundaries of what's possible. Writing that's not concerned with pleasing the masses, but with pleasing oneself. And that, my friends, is the true art of essay writing.",349,25-05-2025,Comparison of a_version_10,0.215,0.1578,0.9564,0.968,0.8923,19.05,0.954,16.22,0.982,0.9878
