THE MAN THAT CORRUPTED HADLEYBURG

I


It was many years ago. Hadleyburg was the most honest and upright town
in all the region round about. It had kept that reputation unsmirched
during three generations, and was prouder of it than of any other of
its possessions. It was so proud of it, and so anxious to insure its
perpetuation, that it began to teach the principles of honest dealing
to its babies in the cradle, and made the like teachings the staple
of their culture thenceforward through all the years devoted to their
education. Also, throughout the formative years temptations were kept
out of the way of the young people, so that their honesty could have
every chance to harden and solidify, and become a part of their very
bone. The neighbouring towns were jealous of this honourable supremacy,
and affected to sneer at Hadleyburg's pride in it and call it vanity;
but all the same they were obliged to acknowledge that Hadleyburg was
in reality an incorruptible town; and if pressed they would also
acknowledge that the mere fact that a young man hailed from Hadleyburg
was all the recommendation he needed when he went forth from his natal
town to seek for responsible employment. But at last, in the drift of time, Hadleyburg had the ill luck to offend
a passing stranger--possibly without knowing it, certainly without
caring, for Hadleyburg was sufficient unto itself, and cared not a rap
for strangers or their opinions. Still, it would have been well to
make an exception in this one's case, for he was a bitter man, and
revengeful. All through his wanderings during a whole year he kept his
injury in mind, and gave all his leisure moments to trying to invent a
compensating satisfaction for it. He contrived many plans, and all of
them were good, but none of them was quite sweeping enough: the poorest
of them would hurt a great many individuals, but what he wanted was a
plan which would comprehend the entire town, and not let so much as one
person escape unhurt. At last he had a fortunate idea, and when it fell
into his brain it lit up his whole head with an evil joy.","joy. He began to form a plan at once, saying to himself “That is the thing to do--I will corrupt the town.” Six months later he went to Hadleyburg, and arrived in a buggy at the house of the old cashier of the bank about ten at night. He got a sack out of the buggy, shouldered it, and staggered with it through the cottage yard, and knocked at the door. A woman's voice said “Come in,” and he entered, and set his sack behind the stove in the parlour, saying politely to the old lady who sat reading the “Missionary Herald” by the lamp: “Pray keep your seat, madam, I will not disturb you. There--now it is pretty well concealed; one would hardly know it was there. Can I see your husband a moment, madam?” No, he was gone to Brixton, and might not return before morning. “Very well, madam, it is no matter. I merely wanted to leave that sack in his care, to be delivered to the rightful owner when he shall be found. I am a stranger; he does not know me; I am merely passing through the town to-night to discharge a matter which has been long in my mind. My errand is now completed, and I go pleased and a little proud, and you will never see me again. There is a paper attached to the sack which will explain everything. Good-night, madam.” The old lady was afraid of the mysterious big stranger, and was glad to see him go. But her curiosity was roused, and she went straight to the sack and brought away the paper. It began as follows: “TO BE PUBLISHED, or, the right man sought out by private inquiry--either will answer. This sack contains gold coin weighing a hundred and sixty pounds four ounces--” “Mercy on us, and the door not locked!” Mrs. Richards flew to it all in a tremble and locked it, then pulled down the window-shades and stood frightened, worried, and wondering if there was anything else she could do toward making herself and the money more safe. She listened awhile for burglars, then surrendered to curiosity, and went back to the lamp and finished reading the paper: “I am a foreigner, and am presently going back to my own country, to remain there permanently. I am grateful to America for what I have received at her hands during my long stay under her flag; and to one of her citizens--a citizen of Hadleyburg--I am especially grateful for a great kindness done me a year or two ago. Two great kindnesses in fact. I will explain. I was a gambler. I say I WAS. I was a ruined gambler. I arrived in this village at night, hungry and without a penny. I asked for help--in the dark; I was ashamed to beg in the light. I begged of the right man. He gave me twenty dollars--that is to say, he gave me life, as I considered it.","He made a
trip to Hadleyburg and found it the same as ever, with the same old
people, and the same old ways, and the same old honest ways. He
determined to make the town a place of corruption. He had no idea of
being a corrupter, but he had the idea of making it corrupt, and that
was enough for him.

II


The man was a widower. He had a daughter, a young woman of twenty,
and he had a son, a young man of twenty-two. He had a house in
Hadleyburg, and he had a good many friends there. He had been in the
town for some years, and was known to all the people in it, and had
become something of a character. He had a peculiar way of talking, and
a peculiar way of looking at things, and he had a habit of making
remarks on the most unimportant matters that would cause a ripple of
laughter or a wave of amusement. He had the habit of being a bit of a
sneaker, and of being a bit of a joker. But in the town, where people
were so honest, and where people were so easily led, he found that his
sneaker ways and his joker ways were very effective in producing the
sort of effect he wanted. He was a man of the world, and he had the
cunning of a man of the world, and he knew how to make things
happen. He had not come to Hadleyburg for the purpose of being a
corrupter, but he had come to be a corrupter. He had no other idea in
his mind but to corrupt the town. He had no other object in life but
to corrupt the town. He had no other wish in his heart but to corrupt
the town.

                               MARK TWAIN

 REPRINTED BY PERMISSION FROM THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW, FEBRUARY, 1901




                   TO THE PERSON SITTING IN DARKNESS. BY MARK TWAIN. Extending the Blessings of Civilization to our Brother who Sits in
Darkness has been a good trade and has paid well, on the whole; and
there is money in it yet, if carefully worked—but not enough, in my
judgment, to make any considerable risk advisable. The People that Sit
in Darkness are getting to be too scarce—too scarce and too shy. And
such darkness as is now left is really of but an indifferent quality,
and not dark enough for the game. The most of those People that Sit in
Darkness have been furnished with more light than was good for them or
profitable for us. We have been injudicious. The Blessings-of-Civilization Trust, wisely and cautiously administered,
is a Daisy. There is more money in it, more territory, more sovereignty
and other kinds of emolument, than there is in any other game that is
played. But Christendom has been playing it badly of late years, and
must certainly suffer by it, in my opinion. She has been so eager to get
every stake that appeared on the green cloth, that the People who Sit in
Darkness have noticed it—they have noticed it, and have begun to show
alarm. They have become suspicious of the Blessings of Civilization. More—they have begun to examine them. This is not well. The Blessings of
Civilization are all right, and a good commercial property; there could
not be a better, in a dim light. In the right kind of a light, and at a
proper distance, with the goods a little out of focus, they furnish this
desirable exhibit to the Gentlemen who Sit in Darkness:

LOVE, JUSTICE, GENTLENESS, CHRISTIANITY, PROTECTION TO THE WEAK,
TEMPERANCE, LAW AND ORDER, LIBERTY, EQUALITY, HONORABLE DEALING, MERCY,
EDUCATION,

—and so on. There. Is it good? Sir, it is pie. It will bring into camp any idiot
that sits in darkness anywhere. But not if we adulterate it. It is
proper to be emphatic upon that point. This brand is strictly for
Export—apparently. Apparently. Privately and confidentially, it is
nothing of the kind. Privately and confidentially, it is merely an
outside cover, gay and pretty and attractive, displaying the special
patterns of our Civilization which we reserve for Home Consumption,
while inside the bale is the Actual Thing that the Customer Sitting in
Darkness buys with his blood and tears and land and liberty. That Actual
Thing is, indeed, Civilization, but it is only for Export. Is there a
difference between the two brands? In some of the details, yes. We all know that the Business is being ruined. The reason is not far to
seek. It is because our Mr. McKinley, and Mr. Chamberlain, and the
Kaiser, and the Czar, and the French have been exporting the Actual
Thing with the outside cover left off. This is bad for the Game.","Game. It shows that these new players of it are not sufficiently acquainted with it. It is a distress to look on and note the mismoves, they are so strange and so awkward. Mr. Chamberlain manufactures a war out of materials so inadequate and so fanciful that they make the boxes grieve and the gallery laugh, and he tries hard to persuade himself that it isn’t purely a private raid for cash, but has a sort of dim, vague respectability about it somewhere, if he could only find the spot; and that, by and by, he can scour the flag clean again after he has finished dragging it through the mud, and make it shine and flash in the vault of heaven once more as it had shone and flashed there a thousand years in the world’s respect until he laid his unfaithful hand upon it. It is bad play—bad. For it exposes the Actual Thing to Them that Sit in Darkness, and they say: “What! Christian against Christian? And only for money? Is this a case of magnanimity, forbearance, love, gentleness, mercy, protection of the weak—this strange and over-showy onslaught of an elephant upon a nest of field-mice, on the pretext that the mice had squeaked an insolence at him—conduct which ‘no self-respecting government could allow to pass unavenged?’ as Mr. Chamberlain said. Was that a good pretext in a small case, when it had not been a good pretext in a large one?—for only recently Russia had affronted the elephant three times and survived alive and unsmitten. Is this Civilization and Progress? Is it something better than we already possess? These harryings and burnings and desert-makings in the Transvaal—is this an improvement on our darkness? Is it, perhaps, possible that there are two kinds of Civilization—one for home consumption and one for the heathen market?” Then They that Sit in Darkness are troubled, and shake their heads; and they read this extract from a letter of a British private, recounting his exploits in one of Methuen’s victories, some days before the affair of Magersfontein, and they are troubled again: “We tore up the hill and into the intrenchments, and the Boers saw we had them; so they dropped their guns and went down on their knees and put up their hands clasped, and begged for mercy. And we gave it them—_with the long spoon_.” The long spoon is the bayonet. See _Lloyd’s Weekly_, London, of those days. The same number—and the same column—contains some quite unconscious satire in the form of shocked and bitter upbraidings of the Boers for their brutalities and inhumanities! Next to our heavy damage, the Kaiser went to playing the game without first mastering it. He lost a couple of missionaries in a riot in Shantung, and in his account he made an overcharge for them. China had to pay a hundred thousand dollars apiece for them, in money; twelve miles of territory, containing several millions of inhabitants and worth twenty million dollars, and","And
there is more of it. The People who Sit in Darkness have been
told that the outside cover is for the Customer’s comfort. That is not
the case. The outside cover is for the Customer’s protection. It is
for the Customer’s protection that the outside cover is. The Customer
is not in the habit of taking the Actual Thing, as it is, without
some kind of a cover. It is the Customer who is in the habit of
taking the Actual Thing with a cover. The cover is the Customer’s
protection. But the Customer is not in the habit of taking the cover
with the Actual Thing. The cover is for the Customer’s protection. It
is for the Customer’s protection that the cover is. The cover is for
the Customer’s protection. The Customer is not in the habit of
taking the cover with the Actual Thing. The cover is for the Customer’s
protection. The Customer is not in the habit of taking the cover with

Although I have had several opportunities to see a bull-fight, I have
never seen one; but I needed a bull-fight in this book, and a trustworthy
one will be found in it. I got it out of John Hay’s _Castilian Days_,
reducing and condensing it to fit the requirements of this small story. Mr. Hay and I were friends from early times, and if he were still with us
he would not rebuke me for the liberty I have taken. The knowledge of military minutiæ exhibited in this book will be found to
be correct, but it is not mine; I took it from _Army Regulations_, ed. 1904; _Hardy’s Tactics_—_Cavalry_, revised ed., 1861; and _Jomini’s
Handbook of Military Etiquette_, West Point ed., 1905. It would not be honest in me to encourage by silence the inference that I
composed the Horse’s private bugle-call, for I did not. I lifted it, as
Aristotle says. It is the opening strain in _The Pizzicato_ in _Sylvia_,
by Delibes. When that master was composing it he did not know it was a
bugle-call, it was I that found it out. Along through the book I have distributed a few anachronisms and unborn
historical incidents and such things, so as to help the tale over the
difficult places. This idea is not original with me; I got it out of
Herodotus. Herodotus says, “Very few things happen at the right time,
and the rest do not happen at all: the conscientious historian will
correct these defects.”

I have spent my life under his saddle—with him in it, too, and he is good for two hundred pounds, without his clothes; and there is no telling how much he does weigh when he is out on the war-path and has his batteries belted on. He is over six feet, is young, hasn’t an ounce of waste flesh, is straight, graceful, springy in his motions, quick as a cat, and has a handsome face, and black hair dangling down on his shoulders, and is beautiful to look at; and nobody is braver than he is, and nobody is stronger, except myself. Yes, a person that doubts that he is fine to see should see him in his beaded buck-skins, on my back and his rifle peeping above his shoulder, chasing a hostile trail, with me going like the wind and his hair streaming out behind from the shelter of his broad slouch. Yes, he is a sight to look at then—and I’m part of it myself. I am his favorite horse, out of dozens. Big as he is, I have carried him eighty-one miles between nightfall and sunrise on the scout; and I am good for fifty, day in and day out, and all the time. I am not large, but I am built on a business basis. I have carried him thousands and thousands of miles on scout duty for the army, and there’s not a gorge, nor a pass, nor a valley, nor a fort, nor a trading post, nor a buffalo-range in the whole sweep of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Plains that we don’t know as well as we know the bugle-calls. He is Chief of Scouts to the Army of the Frontier, and it makes us very important. In such a position as I hold in the military service one needs to be of good family and possess an education much above the common to be worthy of the place. I am the best-educated horse outside of the hippodrome, everybody says, and the best-mannered. It may be so, it is not for me to say; modesty is the best policy, I think. Buffalo Bill taught me the most of what I know, my mother taught me much, and I taught myself the rest. Lay a row of moccasins before me—Pawnee, Sioux, Shoshone, Cheyenne, Blackfoot, and as many other tribes as you please—and I can name the tribe every moccasin belongs to by the make of it. Name it in horse-talk, and could do it in American if I had speech. I know some of the Indian signs—the signs they make with their hands, and by signal-fires at night and columns","* * * * *


A Horse’s Tale

CHAP. I.
SOLDIER BOY—PRIVATELY TO HIMSELF

I was born in a stable, as I have no recollection of being born in any
other place. I was born in the year 1861, and the year was a very
merry one, for the United States was at war with the South. The
people were in a great excitement over the war, and I had a very
good time in that respect, for I was not in the war, but I was
dancing on the straw in the stable. The people were in a great
excitement, and I was in a great excitement, for I was not in the war,
but I was dancing on the straw in the stable. I was a young horse

be a soldier, and I had a great mind to be a soldier, and I was
determined to be a soldier.

Conversation as it was by the Social Fireside in the Time of the Tudors


By Mark Twain




INTRODUCTION

“Born irreverent,” scrawled Mark Twain on a scratch pad, “--like all
other people I have ever known or heard of--I am hoping to remain
so while there are any reverent irreverences left to make fun of.”
 --[Holograph manuscript of Samuel L. Clemens, in the collection of the
F. J. Meine]

Mark Twain was just as irreverent as he dared be, and 1601 reveals
his richest expression of sovereign contempt for overstuffed language,
genteel literature, and conventional idiocies. Later, when a magazine
editor apostrophized, “O that we had a Rabelais!” Mark impishly
and anonymously--submitted 1601; and that same editor, a praiser of
Rabelais, scathingly abused it and the sender. In this episode, as in
many others, Mark Twain, the “bad boy” of American literature, revealed
his huge delight in blasting the shams of contemporary hypocrisy. Too,
there was always the spirit of Tom Sawyer deviltry in Mark's make-up
that prompted him, as he himself boasted, to see how much holy
indignation he could stir up in the world. WHO WROTE 1601? The correct and complete title of 1601, as first issued, was: [Date,
1601.] 'Conversation, as it was by the Social Fireside, in the Time of
the Tudors.' For many years after its anonymous first issue in 1880,
its authorship was variously conjectured and widely disputed. In Boston,
William T. Ball, one of the leading theatrical critics during the late
90's, asserted that it was originally written by an English actor (name
not divulged) who gave it to him. Ball's original, it was said, looked
like a newspaper strip in the way it was printed, and may indeed have
been a proof pulled in some newspaper office. In St. Louis, William
Marion Reedy, editor of the St. Louis Mirror, had seen this famous tour
de force circulated in the early 80's in galley-proof form; he first
learned from Eugene Field that it was from the pen of Mark Twain. “Many people,” said Reedy, “thought the thing was done by Field and
attributed, as a joke, to Mark Twain. Field had a perfect genius for
that sort of thing, as many extant specimens attest, and for that sort
of practical joke; but to my thinking the humor of the piece is too
mellow--not hard and bright and bitter--to be Eugene Field's.” Reedy's
opinion hits off the fundamental difference between these two great
humorists; one half suspects that Reedy was thinking of Field's French
Crisis. But Twain first claimed his bantling from the fog of anonymity in 1906,
in a letter addressed to Mr. Charles Orr, librarian of Case Library,
Cleveland. Said Clemens, in the course of his letter, dated July 30,
1906, from Dublin, New Hampshire:

“The title of the piece is 1601.","601. The piece is a supposititious conversation which takes place in Queen Elizabeth's closet in that year, between the Queen, Ben Jonson, Beaumont, Sir Walter Raleigh, the Duchess of Bilgewater, and one or two others, and is not, as John Hay mistakenly supposes, a serious effort to bring back our literature and philosophy to the sober and chaste Elizabeth's time; if there is a decent word findable in it, it is because I overlooked it. I hasten to assure you that it is not printed in my published writings.” TWITTING THE REV. JOSEPH TWICHELL The circumstances of how 1601 came to be written have since been officially revealed by Albert Bigelow Paine in 'Mark Twain, A Bibliography' (1912), and in the publication of Mark Twain's Notebook (1935). 1601 was written during the summer of 1876 when the Clemens family had retreated to Quarry Farm in Elmira County, New York. Here Mrs. Clemens enjoyed relief from social obligations, the children romped over the countryside, and Mark retired to his octagonal study, which, perched high on the hill, looked out upon the valley below. It was in the famous summer of 1876, too, that Mark was putting the finishing touches to Tom Sawyer. Before the close of the same year he had already begun work on 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn', published in 1885. It is interesting to note the use of the title, the “Duke of Bilgewater,” in Huck Finn when the “Duchess of Bilgewater” had already made her appearance in 1601. Sandwiched between his two great masterpieces, Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn, the writing of 1601 was indeed a strange interlude. During this prolific period Mark wrote many minor items, most of them rejected by Howells, and read extensively in one of his favorite books, Pepys' Diary. Like many another writer Mark was captivated by Pepys' style and spirit, and “he determined,” says Albert Bigelow Paine in his 'Mark Twain, A Biography', “to try his hand on an imaginary record of conversation and court manners of a bygone day, written in the phrase of the period. The result was 'Fireside Conversation in the Time of Queen Elizabeth', or as he later called it, '1601'. The 'conversation' recorded by a supposed Pepys of that period, was written with all the outspoken coarseness and nakedness of that rank day, when fireside sociabilities were limited only to the loosened fancy, vocabulary, and physical performance, and not by any bounds of convention.” “It was written as a letter,” continues Paine, “to that robust divine, Rev. Joseph Twichell, who, unlike Howells, had no scruples about Mark's 'Elizabethan breadth of parlance.'” The Rev. Joseph Twichell, Mark's most intimate friend for over forty years, was pastor of the Asylum Hill Congregational Church of Hartford, which Mark facetiously called the “Church of the Holy Speculators,” because of its wealthy parishioners. Here Mark had first met “Joe” at a social, and their meeting ripened into a glorious, life long friendship. Twichell was a man of about Mark's own age,","The first edition of it was published
in 1880, but was not known to the public until 1881. It was a very
wonderful piece, and was published in that time as a ‘conversation
as it was by the Social Fireside in the Time of the Tudors.’ The
authorship was a mystery for a long time, and was variously
suspected, but in the course of the years I have come to believe that
it is my own. I have no doubt of it. I have read the whole thing,
and I am satisfied. The editor of the Boston Transcript, Mr. H. T.
Barnes, has written to me that he has read it, and is satisfied that it is
my own.”

Twain, however, had not yet been able to get the editor to recognize
it, but the editor, who had not read it, was not in a position to
recognize it. So the authorship was not yet settled, and the work
remained in the hands of the editor. The editor was then, however,
a very young man, and had not yet acquired the wisdom to understand
that it was not the author's work. But, in 1908, he was to be
compelled by a letter from Twain, and the evidence of the text, to
acknowledge the authorship of the piece. In the year 1913, the work
was published in a new edition, with the author's name given, and
with the original title. The new edition, published in New York by
Scribner's, was the first time that the authorship was recognized.
The work has since been reprinted many times, and is still in print.

So the story of 1601 is a story of a work that was anonymous, then
a mystery, then an open secret,",470,500,291,0.2464,0.1635,0.9899,0.9386,0.84,0.8951,3.68,-2.0259,0.3332,0.3668,0.0513,0.0799,0.0064,0.0385,0.6073,0.6245,0.9876,0.9696,0.3623693379790941,0.371900826446281,0.5222551928783383,9,9,0.944,0.9459,0.225531914893617,0.202,0.16838487972508592,0.9953,0.5931,29-05-2025

PREFATORY. This book is merely a personal narrative, and not a pretentious history
or a philosophical dissertation. It is a record of several years of
variegated vagabondizing, and its object is rather to help the resting
reader while away an idle hour than afflict him with metaphysics, or
goad him with science. Still, there is information in the volume;
information concerning an interesting episode in the history of the Far
West, about which no books have been written by persons who were on the
ground in person, and saw the happenings of the time with their own
eyes. I allude to the rise, growth and culmination of the silver-mining
fever in Nevada—a curious episode, in some respects; the only one, of
its peculiar kind, that has occurred in the land; and the only one,
indeed, that is likely to occur in it. Yes, take it all around, there is quite a good deal of information in
the book. I regret this very much; but really it could not be helped:
information appears to stew out of me naturally, like the precious ottar
of roses out of the otter. Sometimes it has seemed to me that I would
give worlds if I could retain my facts; but it cannot be. The more I
calk up the sources, and the tighter I get, the more I leak wisdom. Therefore, I can only claim indulgence at the hands of the reader, not
justification. THE AUTHOR. CONTENTS. CHAPTER I. My Brother appointed Secretary of Nevada—I Envy His

PART I

     “We ought never to do wrong when people are looking.”




I

The first scene is in the country, in Virginia; the time, 1880. There
has been a wedding, between a handsome young man of slender means and
a rich young girl--a case of love at first sight and a precipitate
marriage; a marriage bitterly opposed by the girl's widowed father. Jacob Fuller, the bridegroom, is twenty-six years old, is of an old but
unconsidered family which had by compulsion emigrated from Sedgemoor,
and for King James's purse's profit, so everybody said--some maliciously--
the rest merely because they believed it. The bride is nineteen and
beautiful. She is intense, high-strung, romantic, immeasurably proud of
her Cavalier blood, and passionate in her love for her young husband. For its sake she braved her father's displeasure, endured his
reproaches, listened with loyalty unshaken to his warning predictions,
and went from his house without his blessing, proud and happy in the
proofs she was thus giving of the quality of the affection which had
made its home in her heart. The morning after the marriage there was a sad surprise for her. Her
husband put aside her proffered caresses, and said:

“Sit down. I have something to say to you. I loved you. That was
before I asked your father to give you to me. His refusal is not my
grievance--I could have endured that. But the things he said of me to
you--that is a different matter. There--you needn't speak; I know quite
well what they were; I got them from authentic sources. Among other
things he said that my character was written in my face; that I was
treacherous, a dissembler, a coward, and a brute without sense of
pity or compassion: the 'Sedgemoor trade-mark,' he called it--and
'white-sleeve badge.' Any other man in my place would have gone to his
house and shot him down like a dog. I wanted to do it, and was minded
to do it, but a better thought came to me: to put him to shame; to break
his heart; to kill him by inches. How to do it? Through my treatment
of you, his idol! I would marry you; and then--Have patience. You will
see.”

From that moment onward, for three months, the young wife suffered all
the humiliations, all the insults, all the miseries that the diligent
and inventive mind of the husband could contrive, save physical injuries
only. Her strong pride stood by her, and she kept the secret of her
troubles. Now and then the husband said, “Why don't you go to your
father and tell him?” Then he invented new tortures, applied them, and
asked again.",". She always answered, “He shall never know by my mouth,” and taunted him with his origin; said she was the lawful slave of a scion of slaves, and must obey, and would--up to that point, but no further; he could kill her if he liked, but he could not break her; it was not in the Sedgemoor breed to do it. At the end of the three months he said, with a dark significance in his manner, “I have tried all things but one”--and waited for her reply. “Try that,” she said, and curled her lip in mockery. That night he rose at midnight and put on his clothes, then said to her, “Get up and dress!” She obeyed--as always, without a word. He led her half a mile from the house, and proceeded to lash her to a tree by the side of the public road; and succeeded, she screaming and struggling. He gagged her then, struck her across the face with his cowhide, and set his bloodhounds on her. They tore the clothes off her, and she was naked. He called the dogs off, and said: “You will be found--by the passing public. They will be dropping along about three hours from now, and will spread the news--do you hear? Good-by. You have seen the last of me.” He went away then. She moaned to herself: “I shall bear a child--to him! God grant it may be a boy!” The farmers released her by-and-by--and spread the news, which was natural. They raised the country with lynching intentions, but the bird had flown. The young wife shut herself up in her father's house; he shut himself up with her, and thenceforth would see no one. His pride was broken, and his heart; so he wasted away, day by day, and even his daughter rejoiced when death relieved him. Then she sold the estate and disappeared. II In 1886 a young woman was living in a modest house near a secluded New England village, with no company but a little boy about five years old. She did her own work, she discouraged acquaintanceships, and had none. The butcher, the baker, and the others that served her could tell the villagers nothing about her further than that her name was Stillman, and that she called the child Archy. Whence she came they had not been able to find out, but they said she talked like a Southerner. The child had no playmates and no comrade, and no teacher but the mother. She taught him diligently and intelligently, and was satisfied with the results--even a little proud of them. One day Archy said, “Mamma, am I different from other children?” “Well, I suppose not. Why?” “There was a child going along out there and asked me if the postman had been by and I said yes, and she said how long since I saw him and I said I hadn't seen him at all, and she said how did I know","At last, after a few weeks, the wife, in the depth of her
suffering, was driven to the verge of madness. She had been a
romantic, a poet, a dreamer, and she was now the opposite. She
saw the world in black and white, and could not think of anything but
the way to get rid of her husband. The question was, how to do it in
the most effective and most convenient way.

She had a plan. She would write a letter to her father, and send it
to him by a certain messenger, and then she would go to the city and
see a doctor, and then return home, and the letter would be delivered.
But that would not do. The husband would be suspicious. He would
notice that she was in a hurry to go to the city, and would think she had
some secret purpose. She had to be more careful. She must not be seen
to go to the city. She must be seen to be doing something else. She
must make it look as if she were going to the city to take care of her
health, but not to see a doctor. She must be seen to be doing
something else. She must be seen to be doing something else. She must
be seen to be doing something else. She must be seen to be doing
something else. She must be seen to be doing something else. She must
be seen to be doing something else. She must be seen to be doing
something else. She must be seen to be doing something else.

She was a woman of strong will and high spirit, and she had a
plan, and she had a plan, and she had a plan, and she had a plan, and she

PREFACE

Book I of this volume occupies a quarter or a third of the volume,
and consists of matter written about four years ago, but not hitherto
published in book form. It contained errors of judgment and of fact. I
have now corrected these to the best of my ability and later knowledge. Book II was written at the beginning of 1903, and has not until
now appeared in any form. In it my purpose has been to present a
character-portrait of Mrs. Eddy, drawn from her own acts and words
solely, not from hearsay and rumor; and to explain the nature and scope
of her Monarchy, as revealed in the Laws by which she governs it, and
which she wrote herself. MARK TWAIN

     “It is the first time since the dawn-days of Creation that
     a Voice has gone crashing through space with such
     placid and complacent confidence and command.”



CHAPTER I

VIENNA 1899. This last summer, when I was on my way back to Vienna from the
Appetite-Cure in the mountains, I fell over a cliff in the twilight, and
broke some arms and legs and one thing or another, and by good luck was
found by some peasants who had lost an ass, and they carried me to the
nearest habitation, which was one of those large, low, thatch-roofed
farm-houses, with apartments in the garret for the family, and a cunning
little porch under the deep gable decorated with boxes of bright colored
flowers and cats; on the ground floor a large and light sitting-room,
separated from the milch-cattle apartment by a partition; and in the
front yard rose stately and fine the wealth and pride of the house, the
manure-pile. That sentence is Germanic, and shows that I am acquiring
that sort of mastery of the art and spirit of the language which enables
a man to travel all day in one sentence without changing cars. There was a village a mile away, and a horse doctor lived there, but
there was no surgeon. It seemed a bad outlook; mine was distinctly
a surgery case. Then it was remembered that a lady from Boston was
summering in that village, and she was a Christian Science doctor and
could cure anything. So she was sent for. It was night by this time, and
she could not conveniently come, but sent word that it was no matter,
there was no hurry, she would give me “absent treatment” now, and come
in the morning; meantime she begged me to make myself tranquil and
comfortable and remember that there was nothing the matter with me. I
thought there must be some mistake.","mistake. “Did you tell her I walked off a cliff seventy-five feet high?” “Yes.” “And struck a boulder at the bottom and bounced?” “Yes.” “And struck another one and bounced again?” “Yes.” “And struck another one and bounced yet again?” “Yes.” “And broke the boulders?” “Yes.” “That accounts for it; she is thinking of the boulders. Why didn't you tell her I got hurt, too?” “I did. I told her what you told me to tell her: that you were now but an incoherent series of compound fractures extending from your scalp-lock to your heels, and that the comminuted projections caused you to look like a hat-rack.” “And it was after this that she wished me to remember that there was nothing the matter with me?” “Those were her words.” “I do not understand it. I believe she has not diagnosed the case with sufficient care. Did she look like a person who was theorizing, or did she look like one who has fallen off precipices herself and brings to the aid of abstract science the confirmations of personal experience?” “Bitte?” It was too large a contract for the Stubenmadchen's vocabulary; she couldn't call the hand. I allowed the subject to rest there, and asked for something to eat and smoke, and something hot to drink, and a basket to pile my legs in; but I could not have any of these things. “Why?” “She said you would need nothing at all.” “But I am hungry and thirsty, and in desperate pain.” “She said you would have these delusions, but must pay no attention to them. She wants you to particularly remember that there are no such things as hunger and thirst and pain.'' “She does does she?” “It is what she said.” “Does she seem to be in full and functionable possession of her intellectual plant, such as it is?” “Bitte?” “Do they let her run at large, or do they tie her up?” “Tie her up?” “There, good-night, run along, you are a good girl, but your mental Geschirr is not arranged for light and airy conversation. Leave me to my delusions.” CHAPTER II It was a night of anguish, of course--at least, I supposed it was, for it had all the symptoms of it--but it passed at last, and the Christian Scientist came, and I was glad She was middle-aged, and large and bony, and erect, and had an austere face and a resolute jaw and a Roman beak and was a widow in the third degree, and her name was Fuller. I was eager to get to business and find relief, but she was distressingly deliberate. She unpinned and unhooked and uncoupled her upholsteries one by one, abolished the wrinkles with a flirt of her hand, and hung the articles up; peeled off her gloves and disposed of them, got a book out of her hand-bag, then drew a chair to the bedside, descended into it without hurry, and I hung out my tongue. She said,","I was in a very bad way, and I
could not imagine that any one could say there was nothing the matter.
But she was very confident, and I had no choice but to believe her. I
was carried in a basket, as it were, by the peasants, up the narrow
staircase, and put in a little room at the top of the house, which was
furnished with a very small bed, and a small table and chair, and a
little window with a narrow frame, and a very small window. She
entered with a light, and I saw that she was a woman of very moderate
height, with a very plain face, but with a look that was very calm and
untroubled, as if she had not only been through many such cases, but
had seen that the thing was not so bad as it looked. She had on a
black dress, and a white apron, and a very small hat, and her hands were
very white and very gentle, and her voice was very calm, and her manner
was very gentle, and I thought that she was a very kind and gentle
woman. She said that she had come to see me, and that she would be
with me for some time. Then she began to talk to me. She was a lady
of fifty or so, and I thought she was quite a woman of the world. She
had a very clear, very distinct, very clear and distinct voice, and she
said that she had come from Boston to be with me, and that she was a
Christian Scientist, and that she was here to help me recover. She
told me that I was not sick, and that I was not hurt, but that I was in a
state of what she called “mental suffering,” which she believed was
caused by an evil spirit. She said that this evil spirit had come into me

THE MYSTERIOUS STRANGER



Chapter 1

It was in 1590--winter. Austria was far away from the world, and asleep;
it was still the Middle Ages in Austria, and promised to remain so
forever. Some even set it away back centuries upon centuries and said
that by the mental and spiritual clock it was still the Age of Belief
in Austria. But they meant it as a compliment, not a slur, and it was so
taken, and we were all proud of it. I remember it well, although I was
only a boy; and I remember, too, the pleasure it gave me. Yes, Austria was far from the world, and asleep, and our village was in
the middle of that sleep, being in the middle of Austria. It drowsed in
peace in the deep privacy of a hilly and woodsy solitude where news from
the world hardly ever came to disturb its dreams, and was infinitely
content. At its front flowed the tranquil river, its surface painted
with cloud-forms and the reflections of drifting arks and stone-boats;
behind it rose the woody steeps to the base of the lofty precipice;
from the top of the precipice frowned a vast castle, its long stretch of
towers and bastions mailed in vines; beyond the river, a league to the
left, was a tumbled expanse of forest-clothed hills cloven by winding
gorges where the sun never penetrated; and to the right a precipice
overlooked the river, and between it and the hills just spoken of lay a
far-reaching plain dotted with little homesteads nested among orchards
and shade trees. The whole region for leagues around was the hereditary property of a
prince, whose servants kept the castle always in perfect condition for
occupancy, but neither he nor his family came there oftener than once
in five years. When they came it was as if the lord of the world had
arrived, and had brought all the glories of its kingdoms along; and when
they went they left a calm behind which was like the deep sleep which
follows an orgy. Eseldorf was a paradise for us boys. We were not overmuch pestered with
schooling. Mainly we were trained to be good Christians; to revere
the Virgin, the Church, and the saints above everything. Beyond these
matters we were not required to know much; and, in fact, not allowed
to. Knowledge was not good for the common people, and could make them
discontented with the lot which God had appointed for them, and God
would not endure discontentment with His plans.","plans. We had two priests. One of them, Father Adolf, was a very zealous and strenuous priest, much considered. There may have been better priests, in some ways, than Father Adolf, but there was never one in our commune who was held in more solemn and awful respect. This was because he had absolutely no fear of the Devil. He was the only Christian I have ever known of whom that could be truly said. People stood in deep dread of him on that account; for they thought that there must be something supernatural about him, else he could not be so bold and so confident. All men speak in bitter disapproval of the Devil, but they do it reverently, not flippantly; but Father Adolf's way was very different; he called him by every name he could lay his tongue to, and it made everyone shudder that heard him; and often he would even speak of him scornfully and scoffingly; then the people crossed themselves and went quickly out of his presence, fearing that something fearful might happen. Father Adolf had actually met Satan face to face more than once, and defied him. This was known to be so. Father Adolf said it himself. He never made any secret of it, but spoke it right out. And that he was speaking true there was proof in at least one instance, for on that occasion he quarreled with the enemy, and intrepidly threw his bottle at him; and there, upon the wall of his study, was the ruddy splotch where it struck and broke. But it was Father Peter, the other priest, that we all loved best and were sorriest for. Some people charged him with talking around in conversation that God was all goodness and would find a way to save all his poor human children. It was a horrible thing to say, but there was never any absolute proof that Father Peter said it; and it was out of character for him to say it, too, for he was always good and gentle and truthful. He wasn't charged with saying it in the pulpit, where all the congregation could hear and testify, but only outside, in talk; and it is easy for enemies to manufacture that. Father Peter had an enemy and a very powerful one, the astrologer who lived in a tumbled old tower up the valley, and put in his nights studying the stars. Every one knew he could foretell wars and famines, though that was not so hard, for there was always a war, and generally a famine somewhere. But he could also read any man's life through the stars in a big book he had, and find lost property, and every one in the village except Father Peter stood in awe of him. Even Father Adolf, who had defied the Devil, had a wholesome respect for the astrologer when he came through our village wearing his tall, pointed hat and his long, flowing robe with","We were taught to

CHAPTER I


Well, when I had been dead about thirty years I begun to get a little
anxious. Mind you, had been whizzing through space all that time, like a
comet. _Like_ a comet! Why, Peters, I laid over the lot of them! Of
course there warn’t any of them going my way, as a steady thing, you
know, because they travel in a long circle like the loop of a lasso,
whereas I was pointed as straight as a dart for the Hereafter; but I
happened on one every now and then that was going my way for an hour or
so, and then we had a bit of a brush together. But it was generally
pretty one-sided, because I sailed by them the same as if they were
standing still. An ordinary comet don’t make more than about 200,000
miles a minute. Of course when I came across one of that sort—like
Encke’s and Halley’s comets, for instance—it warn’t anything but just a
flash and a vanish, you see. You couldn’t rightly call it a race. It
was as if the comet was a gravel-train and I was a telegraph despatch. But after I got outside of our astronomical system, I used to flush a
comet occasionally that was something _like_. _We_ haven’t got any such
comets—ours don’t begin. One night I was swinging along at a good round
gait, everything taut and trim, and the wind in my favor—I judged I was
going about a million miles a minute—it might have been more, it couldn’t
have been less—when I flushed a most uncommonly big one about three
points off my starboard bow. By his stern lights I judged he was bearing
about northeast-and-by-north-half-east. Well, it was so near my course
that I wouldn’t throw away the chance; so I fell off a point, steadied my
helm, and went for him. You should have heard me whiz, and seen the
electric fur fly! In about a minute and a half I was fringed out with an
electrical nimbus that flamed around for miles and miles and lit up all
space like broad day. The comet was burning blue in the distance, like a
sickly torch, when I first sighted him, but he begun to grow bigger and
bigger as I crept up on him. I slipped up on him so fast that when I had
gone about 150,000,000 miles I was close enough to be swallowed up in the
phosphorescent glory of his wake, and I couldn’t see anything for the
glare. Thinks I, it won’t do to run into him, so I shunted to one side
and tore along.","e and tore along. By and by I closed up abreast of his tail. Do you know what it was like? It was like a gnat closing up on the continent of America. I forged along. By and by I had sailed along his coast for a little upwards of a hundred and fifty million miles, and then I could see by the shape of him that I hadn’t even got up to his waistband yet. Why, Peters, _we_ don’t know anything about comets, down here. If you want to see comets that _are_ comets, you’ve got to go outside of our solar system—where there’s room for them, you understand. My friend, I’ve seen comets out there that couldn’t even lay down inside the _orbits_ of our noblest comets without their tails hanging over. Well, I boomed along another hundred and fifty million miles, and got up abreast his shoulder, as you may say. I was feeling pretty fine, I tell you; but just then I noticed the officer of the deck come to the side and hoist his glass in my direction. Straight off I heard him sing out—“Below there, ahoy! Shake her up, shake her up! Heave on a hundred million billion tons of brimstone!” “Ay-ay, sir!” “Pipe the stabboard watch! All hands on deck!” “Ay-ay, sir!” “Send two hundred thousand million men aloft to shake out royals and sky-scrapers!” “Ay-ay, sir!” “Hand the stuns’ls! Hang out every rag you’ve got! Clothe her from stem to rudder-post!” “Ay-ay, sir!” In about a second I begun to see I’d woke up a pretty ugly customer, Peters. In less than ten seconds that comet was just a blazing cloud of red-hot canvas. It was piled up into the heavens clean out of sight—the old thing seemed to swell out and occupy all space; the sulphur smoke from the furnaces—oh, well, nobody can describe the way it rolled and tumbled up into the skies, and nobody can half describe the way it smelt. Neither can anybody begin to describe the way that monstrous craft begun to crash along. And such another powwow—thousands of bo’s’n’s whistles screaming at once, and a crew like the populations of a hundred thousand worlds like ours all swearing at once. Well, I never heard the like of it before. We roared and thundered along side by side, both doing our level best, because I’d never struck a comet before that could lay over me, and so I was bound to beat this one or break something. I judged I had some reputation in space, and I calculated to keep it. I noticed I wasn’t gaining as fast, now, as I was before, but still I was gaining. There was a power of excitement on board the comet. Upwards of a hundred billion passengers swarmed up from below and rushed to the side and begun to bet on the race. Of course this careened her and damaged her speed. My, but wasn’t the mate mad! He jumped","I came to a point where the space was all lit up with
the phosphorescence of the comet’s wake, and I thought I was going to
have to go through that. I was in a state of excitement, and I was
hurrying, so I just gave a sort of a _whack_ and the space cleared up.
I was going so fast that I hadn’t time to think about the thing. I just
made a sort of a _whack_ and the space cleared up. I was going so fast
that I hadn’t time to think about the thing. I just made a sort of a
_whack_ and the space cleared up. I was going so fast that I hadn’t
time to think about the thing. I just made a sort of a _whack_ and the
space cleared up.

It was like that, and I think I was right glad to get out of that
business. I was going to be in the Hereafter now, and I had the idea that
I was going to be a very fine, smart, and stylish person, and I was
going to get a good, well-fitted, and elegant looking car and a
beautifully dressed driver. I was going to be a very fine, smart, and
stylish person, and I was going to get a good, well-fitted, and
elegant looking car and a beautifully dressed driver. I was going to
be a very fine, smart, and stylish person, and I was going to get a
good, well-fitted, and elegant looking car and a beautifully dressed
driver.

But, you see, I had not been in the Hereafter long when I had a
collision. I was going along, you see, in a beautiful, well-fitted,
elegant looking car, driven by a beautiful, well-dressed driver, and I
had just got out of the gate,",497,500,303,0.2393,0.1437,0.9711,0.9421,0.5633,0.9052,-10.7506,-2.3333,0.3774,0.3103,0.0395,0.0533,0.0021,0.0041,0.6666,0.4404,0.9788,0.9777,0.4641638225255973,0.4343598055105348,0.5282485875706214,7,8,0.9524,0.9825,0.1448692152917505,0.154,0.15841584158415842,0.9097,0.4728,29-05-2025

Mark_Twain,The Man That Corrupted Hadleyburg (2).txt,"THE MAN THAT CORRUPTED HADLEYBURG


I. It was many years ago. Hadleyburg was the most honest and upright town
in all the region round about. It had kept that reputation unsmirched
during three generations, and was prouder of it than of any other of its
possessions. It was so proud of it, and so anxious to insure its
perpetuation, that it began to teach the principles of honest dealing to
its babies in the cradle, and made the like teachings the staple of
their culture thenceforward through all the years devoted to their
education. Also, throughout the formative years temptations were kept
out of the way of the young people, so that their honesty could have
every chance to harden and solidify, and become a part of their very
bone. The neighbouring towns were jealous of this honourable supremacy,
and affected to sneer at Hadleyburg’s pride in it and call it vanity;
but all the same they were obliged to acknowledge that Hadleyburg was in
reality an incorruptible town; and if pressed they would also
acknowledge that the mere fact that a young man hailed from Hadleyburg
was all the recommendation he needed when he went forth from his natal
town to seek for responsible employment. But at last, in the drift of time, Hadleyburg had the ill luck to offend
a passing stranger--possibly without knowing it, certainly without
caring, for Hadleyburg was sufficient unto itself, and cared not a rap
for strangers or their opinions. Still, it would have been well to make
an exception in this one’s case, for he was a bitter man, and
revengeful. All through his wanderings during a whole year he kept his
injury in mind, and gave all his leisure moments to trying to invent a
compensating satisfaction for it. He contrived many plans, and all of
them were good, but none of them was quite sweeping enough: the poorest
of them would hurt a great many individuals, but what he wanted was a
plan which would comprehend the entire town, and not let so much as one
person escape unhurt. At last he had a fortunate idea, and when it fell
into his brain it lit up his whole head with an evil joy. He began to
form a plan at once, saying to himself “That is the thing to do--I will
corrupt the town.”

Six months later he went to Hadleyburg, and arrived in a buggy at the
house of the old cashier of the bank about ten at night. He got a sack
out of the buggy, shouldered it, and staggered with it through the
cottage yard, and knocked at the door. A woman’s voice said “Come in,”
and he entered, and set his sack behind the stove in the parlour, saying
politely to the old lady who sat reading the “Missionary Herald” by the
lamp:

“Pray keep your seat, madam, I will not disturb you. There--now it is
pretty well concealed; one would hardly know it was there.","e. Can I see your husband a moment, madam?” No, he was gone to Brixton, and might not return before morning. “Very well, madam, it is no matter. I merely wanted to leave that sack in his care, to be delivered to the rightful owner when he shall be found. I am a stranger; he does not know me; I am merely passing through the town to-night to discharge a matter which has been long in my mind. My errand is now completed, and I go pleased and a little proud, and you will never see me again. There is a paper attached to the sack which will explain everything. Good-night, madam.” The old lady was afraid of the mysterious big stranger, and was glad to see him go. But her curiosity was roused, and she went straight to the sack and brought away the paper. It began as follows: “TO BE PUBLISHED, or, the right man sought out by private inquiry--either will answer. This sack contains gold coin weighing a hundred and sixty pounds four ounces--” “Mercy on us, and the door not locked!” Mrs. Richards flew to it all in a tremble and locked it, then pulled down the window-shades and stood frightened, worried, and wondering if there was anything else she could do toward making herself and the money more safe. She listened awhile for burglars, then surrendered to curiosity, and went back to the lamp and finished reading the paper: “I am a foreigner, and am presently going back to my own country, to remain there permanently. I am grateful to America for what I have received at her hands during my long stay under her flag; and to one of her citizens--a citizen of Hadleyburg--I am especially grateful for a great kindness done me a year or two ago. Two great kindnesses in fact. I will explain. I was a gambler. I say I WAS. I was a ruined gambler. I arrived in this village at night, hungry and without a penny. I asked for help--in the dark; I was ashamed to beg in the light. I begged of the right man. He gave me twenty dollars--that is to say, he gave me life, as I considered it. He also gave me fortune; for out of that money I have made myself rich at the gaming-table. And finally, a remark which he made to me has remained with me to this day, and has at last conquered me; and in conquering has saved the remnant of my morals: I shall gamble no more. Now I have no idea who that man was, but I want him found, and I want him to have this money, to give away, throw away, or keep, as he pleases. It is merely my way of testifying my gratitude to him. If I could stay, I would find him myself; but no matter, he will be found. This is an honest town, an incorruptible town, and I know I can","I have
brought a sack of money, and I am going to give it to you. I hope you
will not be offended, but it is for the purpose of helping you to
support your family, and I think you are in a hard position.”

The old lady looked up with a puzzled expression, and said:

“Why, sir, I am not in any hard position. I have the most comfortable
home, and the most prosperous family. I have never known the
miseries of want, and I would not have you think that I am in want of
any assistance. I am not at all offended, but I am not in want of any
assistance. I think, sir, that you are mistaken in your idea of me.”

The stranger looked at her, and said, “I see that I am mistaken. I
thought you were in want, but I see that you are not. I had a different
idea of you. I thought you were poor, but I see that you are not. I
thought you were a woman in want of assistance, but I see that you are
not. I had a wrong idea of you, and I am sorry for that. But I have
brought the money for a reason. I thought that you were in want, but I
see that you are not. I have a different idea of you now, and I will
not trouble you further. I have brought the money, and I will take it
back.”

He took the sack from the corner, and started toward the door. The
old lady said:

“Wait, sir. I do not know why I am not in want, but I am not in want.
I am not in want of any assistance, and I will not take it. I think that
you have made a mistake, and that you are not a good man. I think that
you are a very bad man, and I",499,500,325,0.1684,0.0556,0.9549,0.8864,0.5355,0.4757,-13.7996,-15.5754,0.3392,0.2903,0.0425,0.0173,0.0032,0.0022,0.3506,0.1703,0.958,0.9145,0.47368421052631576,0.4772344013490725,0.58994708994709,7,6,0.9595,0.9622,0.12024048096192384,0.186,0.15384615384615385,0.8928,0.5268,29-05-2025
Mark_Twain,Some Rambling Notes of an Idle Excursion.txt,"SOME RAMBLING NOTES OF AN IDLE EXCURSION

by Mark Twain






I. All the journeyings I had ever done had been purely in the way of
business. The pleasant May weather suggested a novelty namely, a trip
for pure recreation, the bread-and-butter element left out. The Reverend
said he would go, too; a good man, one of the best of men, although a
clergyman. By eleven at night we were in New Haven and on board the New
York boat. We bought our tickets, and then went wandering around here
and there, in the solid comfort of being free and idle, and of putting
distance between ourselves and the mails and telegraphs. After a while I went to my stateroom and undressed, but the night
was too enticing for bed. We were moving down the bay now, and it was
pleasant to stand at the window and take the cool night breeze and watch
the gliding lights on shore. Presently, two elderly men sat down
under that window and began a conversation. Their talk was properly
no business of mine, yet I was feeling friendly toward the world and
willing to be entertained. I soon gathered that they were brothers, that
they were from a small Connecticut village, and that the matter in hand
concerned the cemetery. Said one:

“Now, John, we talked it all over amongst ourselves, and this is what
we've done. You see, everybody was a-movin' from the old buryin'-ground,
and our folks was 'most about left to theirselves, as you may say. They
was crowded, too, as you know; lot wa'n't big enough in the first place;
and last year, when Seth's wife died, we couldn't hardly tuck her in. She sort o' overlaid Deacon Shorb's lot, and he soured on her, so to
speak, and on the rest of us, too. So we talked it over, and I was for
a lay out in the new simitery on the hill. They wa'n't unwilling, if
it was cheap. Well, the two best and biggest plots was No. 8 and No. 9--both of a size; nice comfortable room for twenty-six--twenty-six
full-growns, that is; but you reckon in children and other shorts, and
strike an average, and I should say you might lay in thirty, or maybe
thirty-two or three, pretty genteel--no crowdin' to signify.”

“That's a plenty, William. Which one did you buy?”

“Well, I'm a-comin' to that, John. You see, No. 8 was thirteen dollars,
No. 9 fourteen--”

“I see. So's't you took No. 8.”

“You wait. I took No. 9. And I'll tell you for why. In the first place,
Deacon Shorb wanted it. Well, after the way he'd gone on about Seth's
wife overlappin' his prem'ses, I'd 'a' beat him out of that No. 9 if I'd
'a' had to stand two dollars extra, let alone one. That's the way I felt
about it. Says I, what's a dollar, anyway?","? Life's on'y a pilgrimage, says I; we ain't here for good, and we can't take it with us, says I. So I just dumped it down, knowin' the Lord don't suffer a good deed to go for nothin', and cal'latin' to take it out o' somebody in the course o' trade. Then there was another reason, John. No. 9's a long way the handiest lot in the simitery, and the likeliest for situation. It lays right on top of a knoll in the dead center of the buryin' ground; and you can see Millport from there, and Tracy's, and Hopper Mount, and a raft o' farms, and so on. There ain't no better outlook from a buryin'-plot in the state. Si Higgins says so, and I reckon he ought to know. Well, and that ain't all. 'Course Shorb had to take No. 8; wa'n't no help for 't. Now, No. 8 jines onto No. 9, but it's on the slope of the hill, and every time it rains it 'll soak right down onto the Shorbs. Si Higgins says 't when the deacon's time comes, he better take out fire and marine insurance both on his remains.” Here there was the sound of a low, placid, duplicate chuckle of appreciation and satisfaction. “Now, John, here's a little rough draft of the ground that I've made on a piece of paper. Up here in the left-hand corner we've bunched the departed; took them from the old graveyard and stowed them one alongside o' t'other, on a first-come-first-served plan, no partialities, with Gran'ther Jones for a starter, on'y because it happened so, and windin' up indiscriminate with Seth's twins. A little crowded towards the end of the lay-out, maybe, but we reckoned 'twa'n't best to scatter the twins. Well, next comes the livin'. Here, where it's marked A, we're goin' to put Mariar and her family, when they're called; B, that's for Brother Hosea and hisn; C, Calvin and tribe. What's left is these two lots here--just the gem of the whole patch for general style and outlook; they're for me and my folks, and you and yourn. Which of them would you ruther be buried in?” “I swan, you've took me mighty unexpected, William! It sort of started the shivers. Fact is, I was thinkin' so busy about makin' things comfortable for the others, I hadn't thought about being buried myself.” “Life's on'y a fleetin' show, John, as the sayin' is. We've all got to go, sooner or later. To go with a clean record's the main thing. Fact is, it's the on'y thing worth strivin' for, John.” “Yes, that's so, William, that's so; there ain't no getting around it. Which of these lots would you recommend?” “Well, it depends, John. Are you particular about outlook?” “I don't say I am, William, I don't say I ain't. Reely, I don't know. But mainly, I reckon, I'd set store by a south exposure.” “That's easy fixed, John. They're both south exposure.","It's but a dollar, and it's
a thing that can be put away and not be missed. But I'm a-tryin' to be
a good man, and I'm a-tryin' to be a Christian. So, in the matter of
the cemetery, I took the more expensive one, and I'm a-sayin' it with
a clear conscience, and I've not only paid the extra dollar, but I've
put a dollar more in for the future. I took the more expensive one,
and I've paid for it. That's the way I feel, and I've no more to say
about it.”

This was the talk of the two brothers. It was not very long, but it
was a talk that had its own kind of interest. I found it a pleasant
thing to listen to. I was not in the least afraid of being heard. I
was not in the least afraid of being seen. I was not in the least
afraid of being known. I was not in the least afraid of being
understood. I was not in the least afraid of being mistaken. I was not
in the least afraid of being laughed at. I was not in the least
afraid of being thought a fool. I was not in the least afraid of being
thought a scoundrel. I was not in the least afraid of being thought a
moralist. I was not in the least afraid of being thought a cynic. I
was not in the least afraid of being thought a fool, or a scoundrel, or
a moralist, or a cynic. I was not in the least afraid of being thought

28 Joan Foretells Her Doom

THE TROOPS must have a rest. Two days would be allowed for this. The
morning of the 14th I was writing from Joan's dictation in a small room
which she sometimes used as a private office when she wanted to get away
from officials and their interruptions. Catherine Boucher came in and
sat down and said:

“Joan, dear, I want you to talk to me.”

“Indeed, I am not sorry for that, but glad. What is in your mind?”

“This. I scarcely slept last night, for thinking of the dangers you are
running. The Paladin told me how you made the duke stand out of the way
when the cannon-balls were flying all about, and so saved his life.”

“Well, that was right, wasn't it?”

“Right? Yes; but you stayed there yourself. Why will you do like that? It seems such a wanton risk.”

“Oh, no, it was not so. I was not in any danger.”

“How can you say that, Joan, with those deadly things flying all about
you?”

Joan laughed, and tried to turn the subject, but Catherine persisted. She said:

“It was horribly dangerous, and it could not be necessary to stay
in such a place.","And you led an assault again. Joan, it is tempting Providence. I want you to make me a promise. I want you to promise me that you will let others lead the assaults, if there must be assaults, and that you will take better care of yourself in those dreadful battles. Will you?” But Joan fought away from the promise and did not give it. Catherine sat troubled and discontented awhile, then she said: “Joan, are you going to be a soldier always? These wars are so long--so long. They last forever and ever and ever.” There was a glad flash in Joan's eye as she cried: “This campaign will do all the really hard work that is in front of it in the next four days. The rest of it will be gentler--oh, far less bloody. Yes, in four days France will gather another trophy like the redemption of Orleans and make her second long step toward freedom!” Catherine started (and so did I); then she gazed long at Joan like one in a trance, murmuring “four days--four days,” as if to herself and unconsciously. Finally she asked, in a low voice that had something of awe in it: “Joan, tell me--how is it that you know that? For you do know it, I think.” “Yes,” said Joan, dreamily, “I know--I know. I shall strike--and strike again. And before the fourth day is finished I shall strike yet again.” She became silent. We sat wondering and still. This was for a whole minute, she looking at the floor and her lips moving but uttering nothing. Then came these words, but hardly audible: “And in a thousand years the English power in France will not rise up from that blow.” It made my flesh creep. It was uncanny. She was in a trance again--I could see it--just as she was that day in the pastures of Domremy when she prophesied about us boys in the war and afterward did not know that she had done it. She was not conscious now; but Catherine did not know that, and so she said, in a happy voice: “Oh, I believe it, I believe it, and I am so glad! Then you will come back and bide with us all your life long, and we will love you so, and honor you!” A scarcely perceptible spasm flitted across Joan's face, and the dreamy voice muttered: “Before two years are sped I shall die a cruel death!” I sprang forward with a warning hand up. That is why Catherine did not scream. She was going to do that--I saw it plainly. Then I whispered her to slip out of the place, and say nothing of what had happened. I said Joan was asleep--asleep and dreaming. Catherine whispered back, and said: “Oh, I am so grateful that it is only a dream! It sounded like prophecy.” And she was gone. Like prophecy! I knew it was prophecy; and I sat down crying, as knowing we","I think you have been very foolish.”

Joan said, “I was not foolish. I was not afraid of danger. I have always
known that I was chosen to be the instrument of God. I am not afraid of
the cannon, nor of anything else. I am not afraid of the devil, either. I
believe he is only a man. I believe that God is the only true God, and
that I am His instrument, and that He will not let me be harmed. I have
always known that.”

Catherine looked at her, and then said:

“Joan, you are going to be killed. I know that. I have seen the signs.
I have seen the omens. I have seen the stars. I have seen the winds.
They all show that you are going to die.”

Joan said, “I know that. I have been told that I am going to die. I have
been told that I am going to be burned. But I am not afraid. I do not
know what is going to happen. I do not know if I will live or die. But I
believe that God will not let me be harmed. I have always known that.”

Catherine looked at her, and said, “You are a very good girl, Joan, but
you are a very foolish girl, too.”

Then Joan said, “I have no fear. I have always known that I was chosen
by God. I am not afraid of the devil, nor of anything. I believe that
God will not let me be harmed. I have always known that.”

Catherine, after a long pause, said, “You will be burned, Joan, and
that is the only thing I can say to you.”

Joan said, “I do not fear that. I have always known that I was chosen by
God. I am not afraid of the devil, nor of anything.

CHAPTER I

[The Knighted Knave of Bergen]


One day it occurred to me that it had been many years since the world
had been afforded the spectacle of a man adventurous enough to undertake
a journey through Europe on foot. After much thought, I decided that
I was a person fitted to furnish to mankind this spectacle. So I
determined to do it. This was in March, 1878. I looked about me for the right sort of person to accompany me in the
capacity of agent, and finally hired a Mr. Harris for this service. It was also my purpose to study art while in Europe. Mr.","purpose to study art while in Europe. Mr. Harris was in sympathy with me in this. He was as much of an enthusiast in art as I was, and not less anxious to learn to paint. I desired to learn the German language; so did Harris. Toward the middle of April we sailed in the HOLSATIA, Captain Brandt, and had a very pleasant trip, indeed. After a brief rest at Hamburg, we made preparations for a long pedestrian trip southward in the soft spring weather, but at the last moment we changed the program, for private reasons, and took the express-train. We made a short halt at Frankfort-on-the-Main, and found it an interesting city. I would have liked to visit the birthplace of Gutenburg, but it could not be done, as no memorandum of the site of the house has been kept. So we spent an hour in the Goethe mansion instead. The city permits this house to belong to private parties, instead of gracing and dignifying herself with the honor of possessing and protecting it. Frankfort is one of the sixteen cities which have the distinction of being the place where the following incident occurred. Charlemagne, while chasing the Saxons (as HE said), or being chased by them (as THEY said), arrived at the bank of the river at dawn, in a fog. The enemy were either before him or behind him; but in any case he wanted to get across, very badly. He would have given anything for a guide, but none was to be had. Presently he saw a deer, followed by her young, approach the water. He watched her, judging that she would seek a ford, and he was right. She waded over, and the army followed. So a great Frankish victory or defeat was gained or avoided; and in order to commemorate the episode, Charlemagne commanded a city to be built there, which he named Frankfort--the ford of the Franks. None of the other cities where this event happened were named for it. This is good evidence that Frankfort was the first place it occurred at. Frankfort has another distinction--it is the birthplace of the German alphabet; or at least of the German word for alphabet --BUCHSTABEN. They say that the first movable types were made on birch sticks--BUCHSTABE--hence the name. I was taught a lesson in political economy in Frankfort. I had brought from home a box containing a thousand very cheap cigars. By way of experiment, I stepped into a little shop in a queer old back street, took four gaily decorated boxes of wax matches and three cigars, and laid down a silver piece worth 48 cents. The man gave me 43 cents change. In Frankfort everybody wears clean clothes, and I think we noticed that this strange thing was the case in Hamburg, too, and in the villages along the road. Even in the narrowest and poorest and most ancient quarters of Frankfort neat and clean clothes were the rule. The","Harris, I suppose, thought that I was not very clear in my purpose, and perhaps it was his intention to have me travel in a more
careful and systematic way, but I had made up my mind to be a tramp, and that was my way of traveling. I had also made up my mind to make a book of my experiences, and I had already decided on a title, ""A Tramp Abroad."" The book, I thought, would be a great success, and I was very hopeful that it would be.

So I set out for the Holsatia, which is a province of Germany, and I was to travel by that country to the Rhine, and from the Rhine to the rest of Europe. The Holsatia is a very good and well-organized country, and the people are as honest as any I have known. I had a small bag of money, and a little leather satchel, and a pack of cards, and a small dog, which I had named ""Peggy,"" and I had a small dog. I had a small dog. I had a small dog.

Mark_Twain,The Facts Concerning the Recent Carnival of Crime in Connecticut.txt,"THE FACTS CONCERNING THE RECENT CARNIVAL OF CRIME IN CONNECTICUT

by Mark Twain



I was feeling blithe, almost jocund. I put a match to my cigar, and
just then the morning's mail was handed in. The first superscription I
glanced at was in a handwriting that sent a thrill of pleasure through
and through me. It was Aunt Mary's; and she was the person I loved and
honored most in all the world, outside of my own household. She had been
my boyhood's idol; maturity, which is fatal to so many enchantments,
had not been able to dislodge her from her pedestal; no, it had only
justified her right to be there, and placed her dethronement permanently
among the impossibilities. To show how strong her influence over me was,
I will observe that long after everybody else's “do-stop-smoking” had
ceased to affect me in the slightest degree, Aunt Mary could still stir
my torpid conscience into faint signs of life when she touched upon the
matter. But all things have their limit in this world. A happy day came
at last, when even Aunt Mary's words could no longer move me. I was
not merely glad to see that day arrive; I was more than glad--I was
grateful; for when its sun had set, the one alloy that was able to mar
my enjoyment of my aunt's society was gone. The remainder of her stay
with us that winter was in every way a delight. Of course she pleaded
with me just as earnestly as ever, after that blessed day, to quit my
pernicious habit, but to no purpose whatever; the moment she opened
the subject I at once became calmly, peacefully, contentedly
indifferent--absolutely, adamantinely indifferent. Consequently the
closing weeks of that memorable visit melted away as pleasantly as a
dream, they were so freighted for me with tranquil satisfaction. I could
not have enjoyed my pet vice more if my gentle tormentor had been a
smoker herself, and an advocate of the practice. Well, the sight of her
handwriting reminded me that I way getting very hungry to see her again. I easily guessed what I should find in her letter. I opened it. Good! just as I expected; she was coming! Coming this very day, too, and by
the morning train; I might expect her any moment. I said to myself, “I am thoroughly happy and content now. If my most
pitiless enemy could appear before me at this moment, I would freely
right any wrong I may have done him.”

Straightway the door opened, and a shriveled, shabby dwarf entered. He
was not more than two feet high. He seemed to be about forty years old.","Every feature and every inch of him was a trifle out of shape; and so, while one could not put his finger upon any particular part and say, “This is a conspicuous deformity,” the spectator perceived that this little person was a deformity as a whole--a vague, general, evenly blended, nicely adjusted deformity. There was a fox-like cunning in the face and the sharp little eyes, and also alertness and malice. And yet, this vile bit of human rubbish seemed to bear a sort of remote and ill-defined resemblance to me! It was dully perceptible in the mean form, the countenance, and even the clothes, gestures, manner, and attitudes of the creature. He was a farfetched, dim suggestion of a burlesque upon me, a caricature of me in little. One thing about him struck me forcibly and most unpleasantly: he was covered all over with a fuzzy, greenish mold, such as one sometimes sees upon mildewed bread. The sight of it was nauseating. He stepped along with a chipper air, and flung himself into a doll's chair in a very free-and-easy way, without waiting to be asked. He tossed his hat into the waste-basket. He picked up my old chalk pipe from the floor, gave the stem a wipe or two on his knee, filled the bowl from the tobacco-box at his side, and said to me in a tone of pert command: “Gimme a match!” I blushed to the roots of my hair; partly with indignation, but mainly because it somehow seemed to me that this whole performance was very like an exaggeration of conduct which I myself had sometimes been guilty of in my intercourse with familiar friends--but never, never with strangers, I observed to myself. I wanted to kick the pygmy into the fire, but some incomprehensible sense of being legally and legitimately under his authority forced me to obey his order. He applied the match to the pipe, took a contemplative whiff or two, and remarked, in an irritatingly familiar way: “Seems to me it's devilish odd weather for this time of year.” I flushed again, and in anger and humiliation as before; for the language was hardly an exaggeration of some that I have uttered in my day, and moreover was delivered in a tone of voice and with an exasperating drawl that had the seeming of a deliberate travesty of my style. Now there is nothing I am quite so sensitive about as a mocking imitation of my drawling infirmity of speech. I spoke up sharply and said: “Look here, you miserable ash-cat! you will have to give a little more attention to your manners, or I will throw you out of the window!” The manikin smiled a smile of malicious content and security, puffed a whiff of smoke contemptuously toward me, and said, with a still more elaborate drawl: “Come--go gently now; don't put on too many airs with your betters.” This cool snub rasped me all over, but it seemed to subjugate","He had a face that was not at all unlike the face of a
hunchback, but with the addition of a peculiarly sharp, angular
contour to the chin, giving it the look of a sharp, intelligent face. He
was dressed in a threadbare, ragged suit of dark blue, and his shoes were
old, worn-out, and soiled. He had a small, black, flat, round hat on his
head, with a wide brim, which he pulled down over his eyes. He looked
like a street peddler, and I thought that he looked rather forlorn than
forlorn. He was very tall, but not very tall, for he was only two feet
high. He had a kind of a thin, sallow, sallow face, and his eyes were
black, but they were not bright. They were very dull, very
expressionless. He was not a very pleasant-looking man, but he was not
a very unpleasant-looking man. He had the air of a man who had been
through much, and had not been very much helped by it. He was very
quiet, very subdued, and very unassuming. I could not see any
triumph in his eyes, nor any satisfaction, nor any kind of joy. He had
the air of a man who had been through some trouble, and was not yet
ready to get over it. He had a very quiet, very serious expression,
and he had a very quiet, very subdued manner of speaking. He did not
seem to be in the least bit of a hurry to say anything, and yet he did
not seem to be in the least bit of a hurry to get away. He was very
dignified, and very composed, and very quiet. He was not a very
good-looking man, but he was not a very bad-looking man. He had a

CHAPTER I

Lakeside was a pleasant little town of five or six thousand inhabitants,
and a rather pretty one, too, as towns go in the Far West. It had church
accommodations for thirty-five thousand, which is the way of the Far
West and the South, where everybody is religious, and where each of the
Protestant sects is represented and has a plant of its own. Rank was
unknown in Lakeside--unconfessed, anyway; everybody knew everybody and
his dog, and a sociable friendliness was the prevailing atmosphere. Saladin Foster was book-keeper in the principal store, and the only
high-salaried man of his profession in Lakeside. He was thirty-five
years old, now; he had served that store for fourteen years; he had
begun in his marriage-week at four hundred dollars a year, and had
climbed steadily up, a hundred dollars a year, for four years; from
that time forth his wage had remained eight hundred--a handsome figure
indeed, and everybody conceded that he was worth it. His wife, Electra, was a capable helpmeet, although--like himself--a
dreamer of dreams and a private dabbler in romance. The first thing she
did, after her marriage--child as she was, aged only nineteen--was to
buy an acre of ground on the edge of the town, and pay down the cash for
it--twenty-five dollars, all her fortune. Saladin had less, by fifteen. She instituted a vegetable garden there, got it farmed on shares by the
nearest neighbor, and made it pay her a hundred per cent. a year. Out of
Saladin's first year's wage she put thirty dollars in the savings-bank,
sixty out of his second, a hundred out of his third, a hundred and fifty
out of his fourth.","th. His wage went to eight hundred a year, then, and meantime two children had arrived and increased the expenses, but she banked two hundred a year from the salary, nevertheless, thenceforth. When she had been married seven years she built and furnished a pretty and comfortable two-thousand-dollar house in the midst of her garden-acre, paid half of the money down and moved her family in. Seven years later she was out of debt and had several hundred dollars out earning its living. Earning it by the rise in landed estate; for she had long ago bought another acre or two and sold the most of it at a profit to pleasant people who were willing to build, and would be good neighbors and furnish a general comradeship for herself and her growing family. She had an independent income from safe investments of about a hundred dollars a year; her children were growing in years and grace; and she was a pleased and happy woman. Happy in her husband, happy in her children, and the husband and the children were happy in her. It is at this point that this history begins. The youngest girl, Clytemnestra--called Clytie for short--was eleven; her sister, Gwendolen--called Gwen for short--was thirteen; nice girls, and comely. The names betray the latent romance-tinge in the parental blood, the parents' names indicate that the tinge was an inheritance. It was an affectionate family, hence all four of its members had pet names, Saladin's was a curious and unsexing one--Sally; and so was Electra's--Aleck. All day long Sally was a good and diligent book-keeper and salesman; all day long Aleck was a good and faithful mother and housewife, and thoughtful and calculating business woman; but in the cozy living-room at night they put the plodding world away, and lived in another and a fairer, reading romances to each other, dreaming dreams, comrading with kings and princes and stately lords and ladies in the flash and stir and splendor of noble palaces and grim and ancient castles. CHAPTER II Now came great news! Stunning news--joyous news, in fact. It came from a neighboring state, where the family's only surviving relative lived. It was Sally's relative--a sort of vague and indefinite uncle or second or third cousin by the name of Tilbury Foster, seventy and a bachelor, reputed well off and corresponding sour and crusty. Sally had tried to make up to him once, by letter, in a bygone time, and had not made that mistake again. Tilbury now wrote to Sally, saying he should shortly die, and should leave him thirty thousand dollars, cash; not for love, but because money had given him most of his troubles and exasperations, and he wished to place it where there was good hope that it would continue its malignant work. The bequest would be found in his will, and would be paid over. PROVIDED, that Sally should be able to prove to the executors that he had _Taken no notice of the","Then, after that, she made the same arrangement with
the savings-bank as she had with the garden, and paid herself a hundred
per cent. a year. So, in ten years, she had saved up a good sum. She
had a good, bright, clever, and pretty face, and a voice that could
carry a hundred yards, and a body that would make the most of a
gallipot. She was not tall, but she was a perfect picture of health,
and she had the best of health, and the best of eyes. She was a
lady of the world, and had been in the world a long time. She had
slept with more men than any woman in the town, and had a reputation
for being a thorough, competent, and pretty woman, but she had never
married again, and was not in love with any man. She was a lady who
knew what she wanted, and had a sense of humor, and could keep a
joke. She had the kind of a mind that could be used for any purpose,
and had the kind of a heart that could be used for any purpose, and
was not in the least afraid of a man. She was a very smart woman, and
the kind of a woman that would not have been in the world if she had
not been smart.

Saladin and Electra had been married for ten years, and had no
children. They had not tried to have any, and had not found the
means. They were not poor, but they were not rich. They had a small
house, a comfortable one, and a good deal of good things in it. The
house was not much more than the house of a man who was a little
rich, and the family was not much more than the family of a man who
was a little rich. They had a small, neat, and",486,500,321,0.1136,0.0542,0.9229,0.8717,0.7529,0.585,-8.5,-14.275,0.3084,0.2212,0.0399,0.034,0.0017,0.0052,0.3386,0.2904,0.9431,0.9434,0.36460176991150445,0.42710120068610635,0.5597826086956522,9,7,0.974,0.7797,0.18106995884773663,0.178,0.14953271028037382,0.8826,0.7502,29-05-2025

America, whose precious privilege it is to call herself the Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave. We and all that are about us here look over the waves longingly, contrasting the privations of this our birthplace with the opulent comfort of that happy refuge. We know how America has welcomed the Germans and the Frenchmen and the stricken and sorrowing Irish, and we know how she has given them bread and work, and liberty, and how grateful they are. And we know that America stands ready to welcome all other oppressed peoples and offer her abundance to all that come, without asking what their nationality is, or their creed or color. And, without being told it, we know that the foreign sufferers she has rescued from oppression and starvation are the most eager of her children to welcome us, because, having suffered themselves, they know what suffering is, and having been generously succored, they long to be generous to other unfortunates and thus show that magnanimity is not wasted upon them.

                                                  AT SEA, 18--. DEAR CHING-FOO: We are far away at sea now; on our way to the beautiful Land of the Free and Home of the Brave. We shall soon be where all men are alike, and where sorrow is not known. The good American who hired me to go to his country is to pay me $12 a month, which is immense wages, you know--twenty times as much as one gets in China. My passage in the ship is a very large sum--indeed, it is a fortune--and this I must pay myself eventually, but I am allowed ample time to make it good to my employer in, he advancing it now. For a mere form, I have turned over my wife, my boy, and my two daughters to my employer's partner for security for the payment of the ship fare. But my employer says they are in no danger of being sold, for he knows I will be faithful to him, and that is the main security. I thought I would have twelve dollars to begin life with in America, but the American Consul took two of them for making a certificate that I was shipped on the steamer.","or making a certificate that I was shipped on the steamer. He has no right to do more than charge the ship two dollars for one certificate for the ship, with the number of her Chinese passengers set down in it; but he chooses to force a certificate upon each and every Chinaman and put the two dollars in his pocket. As 1,300 of my countrymen are in this vessel, the Consul received $2,600 for certificates. My employer tells me that the Government at Washington know of this fraud, and are so bitterly opposed to the existence of such a wrong that they tried hard to have the extor--the fee, I mean, legalised by the last Congress;--[Pacific and Mediterranean steamship bills.(Ed. Mem.)]--but as the bill did not pass, the Consul will have to take the fee dishonestly until next Congress makes it legitimate. It is a great and good and noble country, and hates all forms of vice and chicanery. We are in that part of the vessel always reserved for my countrymen. It is called the steerage. It is kept for us, my employer says, because it is not subject to changes of temperature and dangerous drafts of air. It is only another instance of the loving unselfishness of the Americans for all unfortunate foreigners. The steerage is a little crowded, and rather warm and close, but no doubt it is best for us that it should be so. Yesterday our people got to quarrelling among themselves, and the captain turned a volume of hot steam upon a mass of them and scalded eighty or ninety of them more or less severely. Flakes and ribbons of skin came off some of them. There was wild shrieking and struggling while the vapour enveloped the great throng, and so some who were not scalded got trampled upon and hurt. We do not complain, for my employer says this is the usual way of quieting disturbances on board the ship, and that it is done in the cabins among the Americans every day or two. Congratulate me, Ching-Foo In ten days more I shall step upon the shore of America, and be received by her great-hearted people; and I shall straighten myself up and feel that I am a free man among freemen.

To arrive at a just estimate of a renowned man’s character one must
judge it by the standards of his time, not ours.","ards of his time, not ours. Judged by the standards of one century, the noblest characters of an earlier one lose much of their luster; judged by the standards of to-day, there is probably no illustrious man of four or five centuries ago whose character could meet the test at all points. But the character of Joan of Arc is unique. It can be measured by the standards of all times without misgiving or apprehension as to the result. Judged by any of them, it is still flawless, it is still ideally perfect; it still occupies the loftiest place possible to human attainment, a loftier one than has been reached by any other mere mortal. When we reflect that her century was the brutalest, the wickedest, the rottenest in history since the darkest ages, we are lost in wonder at the miracle of such a product from such a soil. The contrast between her and her century is the contrast between day and night. She was truthful when lying was the common speech of men; she was honest when honesty was become a lost virtue; she was a keeper of promises when the keeping of a promise was expected of no one; she gave her great mind to great thoughts and great purposes when other great minds wasted themselves upon pretty fancies or upon poor ambitions; she was modest, and fine, and delicate when to be loud and coarse might be said to be universal; she was full of pity when a merciless cruelty was the rule; she was steadfast when stability was unknown, and honorable in an age which had forgotten what honor was; she was a rock of convictions in a time when men believed in nothing and scoffed at all things; she was unfailingly true to an age that was false to the core; she maintained her personal dignity unimpaired in an age of fawnings and servilities; she was of a dauntless courage when hope and courage had perished in the hearts of her nation; she was spotlessly pure in mind and body when society in the highest places was foul in both—she was all these things in an age when crime was the common business of lords and princes, and when the highest personages in Christendom were able to astonish even that infamous era and make it stand aghast at the spectacle of their atrocious lives black with unimaginable treacheries, butcheries, and beastialities. She was perhaps the only entirely unselfish person whose name has a place in profane history. No vestige or suggestion of self-seeking can be found in any word or deed of hers. When she had rescued her King from his vagabondage, and set his crown upon his head, she was offered rewards and honors, but she refused them all, and would take nothing. All she would take for herself—if the King would grant it—was leave to go back to her village home, and tend her sheep again, and feel her mother’s arms about","But the standards of
the time of Joan of Arc were not the standards of the time of
Mark Twain. So, for the sake of a proper comparison, I have
translated this work of Twain’s into the English language, and
have made a commentary to the effect that the book is a
contemporary account of Joan of Arc, written in the style of
Twain, and that it is the only known account of her life that is
not a hagiographic or polemical work. I have also included a
short biography of Joan of Arc, as an introduction, and a
discussion of a particular peculiarity of her history, which is
that she was the only woman ever to have commanded the armies
of a nation at seventeen. In the commentary, I have also
attempted to show the truth of the narrative by examining the
works of various authorities, including the works of some of
the most important historians of Joan of Arc. It is not my
intention to make a new work, but to present the work of Twain
as it is, as it was originally written, and to give an
explanation of the text in order to make it more understandable
to modern readers. I have also included a short biography of Joan
of Arc in the text, to serve as a guide for the reader, and to
help in understanding the narrative. This is the first volume
of the two-volume work, which is to be published in the near
future. The second volume will be published after the first
volume has been issued, and it will contain the second half of
the story, including the trial, the condemnation, the
imprisonment, and the execution of Joan. The second volume will
also contain the posthumous rehabilitation of Joan, including
the posthumous canonization of her, and the events that
followed.

     WHAT PAUL BOURGET THINKS OF US

     A LITTLE NOTE TO M. PAUL BOURGET




WHAT PAUL BOURGET THINKS OF US

He reports the American joke correctly. In Boston they ask, How much
does he know? in New York, How much is he worth? in Philadelphia, Who
were his parents? And when an alien observer turns his telescope upon
us--advertisedly in our own special interest--a natural apprehension
moves us to ask, What is the diameter of his reflector? I take a great interest in M. Bourget's chapters, for I know by the
newspapers that there are several Americans who are expecting to get
a whole education out of them; several who foresaw, and also foretold,
that our long night was over, and a light almost divine about to break
upon the land. “His utterances concerning us are bound to be weighty and well
          timed.”

          “He gives us an object-lesson which should be thoughtfully and
          profitably studied.”

These well-considered and important verdicts were of a nature to restore
public confidence, which had been disquieted by questionings as to
whether so young a teacher would be qualified to take so large a class
as 70,000,000, distributed over so extensive a schoolhouse as America,
and pull it through without assistance. I was even disquieted myself, although I am of a cold, calm temperament,
and not easily disturbed. I feared for my country. And I was not wholly
tranquilized by the verdicts rendered as above. It seemed to me that
there was still room for doubt. In fact, in looking the ground over I
became more disturbed than I was before. Many worrying questions came
up in my mind. Two were prominent. Where had the teacher gotten his
equipment? What was his method? He had gotten his equipment in France. Then as to his method! I saw by his own intimations that he was
an Observer, and had a System that used by naturalists and other
scientists. The naturalist collects many bugs and reptiles and
butterflies and studies their ways a long time patiently. By this
means he is presently able to group these creatures into families and
subdivisions of families by nice shadings of differences observable in
their characters. Then he labels all those shaded bugs and things with
nicely descriptive group names, and is now happy, for his great work is
completed, and as a result he intimately knows every bug and shade of
a bug there, inside and out. It may be true, but a person who was not a
naturalist would feel safer about it if he had the opinion of the bug. I
think it is a pleasant System, but subject to error. The Observer of Peoples has to be a Classifier, a Grouper, a Deducer, a
Generalizer, a Psychologizer; and, first and last, a Thinker. He has
to be all these, and when he is at home, observing his own folk, he is
often able to prove competency.","ove competency. But history has shown that when he is abroad observing unfamiliar peoples the chances are heavily against him. He is then a naturalist observing a bug, with no more than a naturalist's chance of being able to tell the bug anything new about itself, and no more than a naturalist's chance of being able to teach it any new ways which it will prefer to its own. To return to that first question. M. Bourget, as teacher, would simply be France teaching America. It seemed to me that the outlook was dark--almost Egyptian, in fact. What would the new teacher, representing France, teach us? Railroading? No. France knows nothing valuable about railroading. Steamshipping? No. France has no superiorities over us in that matter. Steamboating? No. French steamboating is still of Fulton's date--1809. Postal service? No. France is a back number there. Telegraphy? No, we taught her that ourselves. Journalism? No. Magazining? No, that is our own specialty. Government? No; Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, Nobility, Democracy, Adultery the system is too variegated for our climate. Religion? No, not variegated enough for our climate. Morals? No, we cannot rob the poor to enrich ourselves. Novel-writing? No. M. Bourget and the others know only one plan, and when that is expurgated there is nothing left of the book. I wish I could think what he is going to teach us. Can it be Deportment? But he experimented in that at Newport and failed to give satisfaction, except to a few. Those few are pleased. They are enjoying their joy as well as they can. They confess their happiness to the interviewer. They feel pretty striped, but they remember with reverent recognition that they had sugar between the cuts. True, sugar with sand in it, but sugar. And true, they had some trouble to tell which was sugar and which was sand, because the sugar itself looked just like the sand, and also had a gravelly taste; still, they knew that the sugar was there, and would have been very good sugar indeed if it had been screened. Yes, they are pleased; not noisily so, but pleased; invaded, or streaked, as one may say, with little recurrent shivers of joy--subdued joy, so to speak, not the overdone kind. And they commune together, these, and massage each other with comforting sayings, in a sweet spirit of resignation and thankfulness, mixing these elements in the same proportions as the sugar and the sand, as a memorial, and saying, the one to the other, and to the interviewer: “It was severe--yes, it was bitterly severe; but oh, how true it was; and it will do us so much good!” If it isn't Deportment, what is left? It was at this point that I seemed to get on the right track at last. M. Bourget would teach us to know ourselves; that was it: he would reveal us to ourselves. That would be an education. He would explain us to ourselves. Then we should understand ourselves; and","But the moment he goes out to observe
other peoples, and in the process of his observations he is in danger
of being misunderstood, or even of being misused. The observer is
therefore always in danger of being misunderstood, or even of being
misused. The observer is always in danger of being misunderstood, or
even of being misused. And when he is in the danger, he has to be on his
guard. He must be on his guard. He must be on his guard. Now, what is this teacher's method, this M. Bourget? I am not sure that he
is not an Observer, but I am not sure that he is not a naturalist. I
am not sure that he is not an Observer, but I am not sure that he is not
a naturalist. I am not sure that he is not an Observer, but I am not sure that he is
not a naturalist. There is the danger. There is the danger. There is the danger. The naturalist is a cautious, methodical worker, but the Observer is a
man of more varied and flexible methods. The naturalist, in the
process of his work, is always careful, methodical, and cautious, but
the Observer is a man of more varied and flexible methods. The naturalist is a cautious, methodical worker, but the Observer is a
man of more varied and flexible methods. I have no doubt that the teacher is an Observer, but I am not sure that he
is not a naturalist. I have no doubt that the teacher is an Observer, but I am not sure that he
is not a naturalist. I have no doubt that the teacher is an Observer, but I am not sure that he

CHAPTER I. TOM SEEKS NEW ADVENTURES


Do you reckon Tom Sawyer was satisfied after all them adventures? I
mean the adventures we had down the river, and the time we set the
darky Jim free and Tom got shot in the leg. No, he wasn’t. It only just
p’isoned him for more. That was all the effect it had. You see, when we
three came back up the river in glory, as you may say, from that long
travel, and the village received us with a torchlight procession and
speeches, and everybody hurrah’d and shouted, it made us heroes, and
that was what Tom Sawyer had always been hankering to be. For a while he _was_ satisfied. Everybody made much of him, and he
tilted up his nose and stepped around the town as though he owned it. Some called him Tom Sawyer the Traveler, and that just swelled him up
fit to bust. You see he laid over me and Jim considerable, because we
only went down the river on a raft and came back by the steamboat, but
Tom went by the steamboat both ways. The boys envied me and Jim a good
deal, but land! they just knuckled to the dirt before TOM. Well, I don’t know; maybe he might have been satisfied if it hadn’t
been for old Nat Parsons, which was postmaster, and powerful long and
slim, and kind o’ good-hearted and silly, and bald-headed, on account
of his age, and about the talkiest old cretur I ever see. For as much
as thirty years he’d been the only man in the village that had a
reputation—I mean a reputation for being a traveler, and of course he
was mortal proud of it, and it was reckoned that in the course of that
thirty years he had told about that journey over a million times and
enjoyed it every time. And now comes along a boy not quite fifteen, and
sets everybody admiring and gawking over _his_ travels, and it just
give the poor old man the high strikes. It made him sick to listen to
Tom, and to hear the people say “My land!” “Did you ever!” “My goodness
sakes alive!” and all such things; but he couldn’t pull away from it,
any more than a fly that’s got its hind leg fast in the molasses.",". And always when Tom come to a rest, the poor old cretur would chip in on _his_ same old travels and work them for all they were worth; but they were pretty faded, and didn’t go for much, and it was pitiful to see. And then Tom would take another innings, and then the old man again—and so on, and so on, for an hour and more, each trying to beat out the other. You see, Parsons’ travels happened like this: When he first got to be postmaster and was green in the business, there come a letter for somebody he didn’t know, and there wasn’t any such person in the village. Well, he didn’t know what to do, nor how to act, and there the letter stayed and stayed, week in and week out, till the bare sight of it gave him a conniption. The postage wasn’t paid on it, and that was another thing to worry about. There wasn’t any way to collect that ten cents, and he reckon’d the gov’ment would hold him responsible for it and maybe turn him out besides, when they found he hadn’t collected it. Well, at last he couldn’t stand it any longer. He couldn’t sleep nights, he couldn’t eat, he was thinned down to a shadder, yet he da’sn’t ask anybody’s advice, for the very person he asked for advice might go back on him and let the gov’ment know about the letter. He had the letter buried under the floor, but that did no good; if he happened to see a person standing over the place it’d give him the cold shivers, and loaded him up with suspicions, and he would sit up that night till the town was still and dark, and then he would sneak there and get it out and bury it in another place. Of course, people got to avoiding him and shaking their heads and whispering, because, the way he was looking and acting, they judged he had killed somebody or done something terrible, they didn’t know what, and if he had been a stranger they would’ve lynched him. Well, as I was saying, it got so he couldn’t stand it any longer; so he made up his mind to pull out for Washington, and just go to the President of the United States and make a clean breast of the whole thing, not keeping back an atom, and then fetch the letter out and lay it before the whole gov’ment, and say, “Now, there she is—do with me what you’re a mind to; though as heaven is my judge I am an innocent man and not deserving of the full penalties of the law and leaving behind me a family that must starve and yet hadn’t had a thing to do with it, which is the whole truth and I can swear to it.” So he did it. He had a little wee bit of steamboating, and some stage-coaching, but all the rest","And so, one day, he went out and said to Tom: “I don’t know what you’re
thinking of, boy, but I do know that you’re not going to make me feel
like this any more.” Then he added, “I don’t want to be called a
traveler, and I don’t want to be called anything else but what I am, and
I don’t want to be talked about, and I don’t want to be admired, and I
don’t want to be envied. I don’t want to be thought of at all.” So Tom, he said, “I don’t want to be thought of at all.” Then he said, “But I want to be
admired, and I want to be envied, and I want to be called the
Traveler, and I want to be made the subject of speeches and
processions and things like that.” Then old Nat said, “You don’t
know what you are saying, boy. You don’t know the position you are in.
You are the most popular boy in the village, and you are not going to
make me feel like this any more.” Then Tom said, “I don’t know what
you mean. I don’t know what you are talking about.” Then old Nat said, “You don’t know what you are talking about. You are not
the only boy in the village, and you are not the only boy who has
traveled. There are plenty of others who have done the same and
haven’t been made the subject of speeches and processions and things
like that.” Then Tom said, “I don’t know what you are talking about. I
don’t know what you mean. I don’t know what you are trying to say.”
Then old Nat said, “I don’t know what you are trying to say, and I
don’t know what you mean.

CHAPTER I. AN INVITATION FOR TOM AND HUCK


[Note: Strange as the incidents of this story are, they are not
inventions, but facts—even to the public confession of the accused. I
take them from an old-time Swedish criminal trial, change the actors,
and transfer the scenes to America. I have added some details, but
only a couple of them are important ones. — M. T.]


Well, it was the next spring after me and Tom Sawyer set our old nigger
Jim free, the time he was chained up for a runaway slave down there on
Tom’s uncle Silas’s farm in Arkansaw. The frost was working out of the
ground, and out of the air, too, and it was getting closer and closer
onto barefoot time every day; and next it would be marble time, and
next mumbletypeg, and next tops and hoops, and next kites, and then
right away it would be summer and going in a-swimming. It just makes a
boy homesick to look ahead like that and see how far off summer is. Yes, and it sets him to sighing and saddening around, and there’s
something the matter with him, he don’t know what. But anyway, he gets
out by himself and mopes and thinks; and mostly he hunts for a lonesome
place high up on the hill in the edge of the woods, and sets there and
looks away off on the big Mississippi down there a-reaching miles and
miles around the points where the timber looks smoky and dim it’s so
far off and still, and everything’s so solemn it seems like everybody
you’ve loved is dead and gone, and you ’most wish you was dead and gone
too, and done with it all. Don’t you know what that is? It’s spring fever. That is what the name
of it is. And when you’ve got it, you want—oh, you don’t quite know
what it is you _do_ want, but it just fairly makes your heart ache, you
want it so! It seems to you that mainly what you want is to get away;
get away from the same old tedious things you’re so used to seeing and
so tired of, and set something new. That is the idea; you want to go
and be a wanderer; you want to go wandering far away to strange
countries where everything is mysterious and wonderful and romantic.","c. And if you can’t do that, you’ll put up with considerable less; you’ll go anywhere you _can_ go, just so as to get away, and be thankful of the chance, too. Well, me and Tom Sawyer had the spring fever, and had it bad, too; but it warn’t any use to think about Tom trying to get away, because, as he said, his Aunt Polly wouldn’t let him quit school and go traipsing off somers wasting time; so we was pretty blue. We was setting on the front steps one day about sundown talking this way, when out comes his aunt Polly with a letter in her hand and says: “Tom, I reckon you’ve got to pack up and go down to Arkansaw—your aunt Sally wants you.” I ’most jumped out of my skin for joy. I reckoned Tom would fly at his aunt and hug her head off; but if you believe me he set there like a rock, and never said a word. It made me fit to cry to see him act so foolish, with such a noble chance as this opening up. Why, we might lose it if he didn’t speak up and show he was thankful and grateful. But he set there and studied and studied till I was that distressed I didn’t know what to do; then he says, very ca’m, and I could a shot him for it: “Well,” he says, “I’m right down sorry, Aunt Polly, but I reckon I got to be excused—for the present.” His aunt Polly was knocked so stupid and so mad at the cold impudence of it that she couldn’t say a word for as much as a half a minute, and this gave me a chance to nudge Tom and whisper: “Ain’t you got any sense? Sp’iling such a noble chance as this and throwing it away?” But he warn’t disturbed. He mumbled back: “Huck Finn, do you want me to let her _see_ how bad I want to go? Why, she’d begin to doubt, right away, and imagine a lot of sicknesses and dangers and objections, and first you know she’d take it all back. You lemme alone; I reckon I know how to work her.” Now I never would ’a’ thought of that. But he was right. Tom Sawyer was always right—the levelest head I ever see, and always _at_ himself and ready for anything you might spring on him. By this time his aunt Polly was all straight again, and she let fly. She says: [Illustration: I reckon I got to be excused] “You’ll be excused! _you_ will! Well, I never heard the like of it in all my days! The idea of you talking like that to _me!_ Now take yourself off and pack your traps; and if I hear another word out of you about what you’ll be excused from and what you won’t, I lay _I’ll_ excuse you—with a hickory!” She hit his head a thump with her thimble","You don’t want to be a boy, you don’t want to be a man, you don’t want to be
a dog or a cat or anything, you don’t want to be anything. You want to be
a ghost, or a fairy, or a thing that you can’t be, and that you can’t
see. You want to be something that you can’t be, but you want to be it
all the same. You want to be a thing that’s not real. But, of course, you
can’t, and that is the saddest thing of all. So, you get up and you go
and you walk around, and you go to places that are strange and
mysterious, and you try to find out things. You try to find out
what is happening in the world, and you try to find out who is
responsible for it, and who is doing it. You get a notion that
there is something mysterious and secret going on, and that the world
is a mystery, and that you are a mystery, and that there is a mystery
in you, and that you are a mystery. So, the next thing is that you want
to find out who is doing the things, and why they are done, and how
they are done. You want to be a detective. You want to be a detective,
and you want to solve a mystery. You want to be a detective, and you
want to find out who did it, and who is doing it. So, you get a notion
that there is a mystery in the world, and that you can solve it, and
that you can be the man who solves it. That is the idea, and that is the
beginning of the detective. And so, when I was a boy, and when I was
in the city, and I was walking around in the streets, and I saw some

THE LOVES OF ALONZO FITZ CLARENCE AND ROSANNAH ETHELTON

It was well along in the forenoon of a bitter winter's day. The town of
Eastport, in the state of Maine, lay buried under a deep snow that was
newly fallen. The customary bustle in the streets was wanting. One
could look long distances down them and see nothing but a dead-white
emptiness, with silence to match. Of course I do not mean that you could
see the silence--no, you could only hear it. The sidewalks were merely
long, deep ditches, with steep snow walls on either side. Here and there
you might hear the faint, far scrape of a wooden shovel, and if you
were quick enough you might catch a glimpse of a distant black figure
stooping and disappearing in one of those ditches, and reappearing the
next moment with a motion which you would know meant the heaving out of
a shovelful of snow. But you needed to be quick, for that black figure
would not linger, but would soon drop that shovel and scud for the
house, thrashing itself with its arms to warm them. Yes, it was too
venomously cold for snow-shovelers or anybody else to stay out long. Presently the sky darkened; then the wind rose and began to blow in
fitful, vigorous gusts, which sent clouds of powdery snow aloft, and
straight ahead, and everywhere. Under the impulse of one of these gusts,
great white drifts banked themselves like graves across the streets; a
moment later another gust shifted them around the other way, driving a
fine spray of snow from their sharp crests, as the gale drives the spume
flakes from wave-crests at sea; a third gust swept that place as clean
as your hand, if it saw fit. This was fooling, this was play; but each
and all of the gusts dumped some snow into the sidewalk ditches, for
that was business. Alonzo Fitz Clarence was sitting in his snug and elegant little parlor,
in a lovely blue silk dressing-gown, with cuffs and facings of crimson
satin, elaborately quilted. The remains of his breakfast were before
him, and the dainty and costly little table service added a harmonious
charm to the grace, beauty, and richness of the fixed appointments of
the room. A cheery fire was blazing on the hearth. A furious gust of wind shook the windows, and a great wave of snow
washed against them with a drenching sound, so to speak. The handsome
young bachelor murmured:

“That means, no going out to-day. Well, I am content. But what to do for
company?","y? Mother is well enough, Aunt Susan is well enough; but these, like the poor, I have with me always. On so grim a day as this, one needs a new interest, a fresh element, to whet the dull edge of captivity. That was very neatly said, but it doesn't mean anything. One doesn't want the edge of captivity sharpened up, you know, but just the reverse.” He glanced at his pretty French mantel-clock. “That clock's wrong again. That clock hardly ever knows what time it is; and when it does know, it lies about it--which amounts to the same thing. Alfred!” There was no answer. “Alfred!... Good servant, but as uncertain as the clock.” Alonzo touched an electric bell button in the wall. He waited a moment, then touched it again; waited a few moments more, and said: “Battery out of order, no doubt. But now that I have started, I will find out what time it is.” He stepped to a speaking-tube in the wall, blew its whistle, and called, “Mother!” and repeated it twice. “Well, that's no use. Mother's battery is out of order, too. Can't raise anybody down-stairs--that is plain.” He sat down at a rosewood desk, leaned his chin on the left-hand edge of it and spoke, as if to the floor: “Aunt Susan!” A low, pleasant voice answered, “Is that you, Alonzo?' “Yes. I'm too lazy and comfortable to go downstairs; I am in extremity, and I can't seem to scare up any help.” “Dear me, what is the matter?” “Matter enough, I can tell you!” “Oh, don't keep me in suspense, dear! What is it?” “I want to know what time it is.” “You abominable boy, what a turn you did give me! Is that all?” “All--on my honor. Calm yourself. Tell me the time, and receive my blessing.” “Just five minutes after nine. No charge--keep your blessing.” “Thanks. It wouldn't have impoverished me, aunty, nor so enriched you that you could live without other means.” He got up, murmuring, “Just five minutes after nine,” and faced his clock. “Ah,” said he, “you are doing better than usual. You are only thirty-four minutes wrong. Let me see... let me see.... Thirty-three and twenty-one are fifty-four; four times fifty-four are two hundred and thirty-six. One off, leaves two hundred and thirty-five. That's right.” He turned the hands of his clock forward till they marked twenty-five minutes to one, and said, “Now see if you can't keep right for a while--else I'll raffle you!” He sat down at the desk again, and said, “Aunt Susan!” “Yes, dear.” “Had breakfast?” “Yes, indeed, an hour ago.” “Busy?” “No--except sewing. Why?” “Got any company?” “No, but I expect some at half past nine.” “I wish I did. I'm lonesome. I want to talk to somebody.” “Very well, talk to me.” “But this is very private.” “Don't be afraid--talk right along, there's nobody here but me.” “I hardly know whether to venture or not, but--” “But what? Oh, don't","I can't stand being alone. I can't stand the thought of being
alone. I have been alone for two hours. I can't bear it. I can't bear it.”

He got up and walked slowly to the door, and stood there a moment, his
face in the shade of the door, and his eyes on the snow-strewn
sidewalks. Then he turned and walked back again, and sat down again.
He was very still. Then he got up again, and walked slowly to the door
once more, and stood there a moment, and then turned and walked back.
He did this several times. He had a peculiar habit of this sort, which
he called ""going through the house."" It was a way of getting the blood
moving, of getting out of the house, of getting out of the house, of
getting out of the house, and of getting back again, of getting back
again. He had a peculiar habit of this sort, which he called ""going
through the house.""

He was a young man of about twenty-four, and of a very refined and
elegant appearance. He had a tall, sinewy frame, and a face that was
clearly the face of a young man who had lived in the country, but he
had the manners of a city man. He was not very tall, but he had the
height of a man who had been in the city, and he had the look of a man
who had been in the city. He was a bachelor, and lived alone in a
comfortable house, with a large parlor, a good-sized dining room, and
a good-sized study. He had a large, well-stocked library. He had a
gymnasium, a billiard room, a music room, a smoking room, and a
dining room.

by Mark Twain




I

I have committed sins, of course; but I have not committed enough of
them to entitle me to the punishment of reduction to the bread and water
of ordinary literature during six years when I might have been living
on the fat diet spread for the righteous in Professor Dowden's Life of
Shelley, if I had been justly dealt with. During these six years I have been living a life of peaceful ignorance. I was not aware that Shelley's first wife was unfaithful to him, and
that that was why he deserted her and wiped the stain from his sensitive
honor by entering into soiled relations with Godwin's young daughter. This was all new to me when I heard it lately, and was told that the
proofs of it were in this book, and that this book's verdict is accepted
in the girls' colleges of America and its view taught in their literary
classes. In each of these six years multitudes of young people in our country
have arrived at the Shelley-reading age. Are these six multitudes
unacquainted with this life of Shelley? Perhaps they are; indeed, one
may feel pretty sure that the great bulk of them are. To these, then,
I address myself, in the hope that some account of this romantic
historical fable and the fabulist's manner of constructing and adorning
it may interest them. First, as to its literary style. Our negroes in America have several
ways of entertaining themselves which are not found among the whites
anywhere. Among these inventions of theirs is one which is particularly
popular with them. It is a competition in elegant deportment. They hire
a hall and bank the spectators' seats in rising tiers along the two
sides, leaving all the middle stretch of the floor free. A cake is
provided as a prize for the winner in the competition, and a bench of
experts in deportment is appointed to award it. Sometimes there are as
many as fifty contestants, male and female, and five hundred spectators. One at a time the contestants enter, clothed regardless of expense in
what each considers the perfection of style and taste, and walk down the
vacant central space and back again with that multitude of critical eyes
on them. All that the competitor knows of fine airs and graces he throws
into his carriage, all that he knows of seductive expression he
throws into his countenance. He may use all the helps he can devise:
watch-chain to twirl with his fingers, cane to do graceful things with,
snowy handkerchief to flourish and get artful effects out of, shiny new
stovepipe hat to assist in his courtly bows; and the colored lady may
have a fan to work up her effects with, and smile over and blush behind,
and she may add other helps, according to her judgment.","t. When the review by individual detail is over, a grand review of all the contestants in procession follows, with all the airs and graces and all the bowings and smirkings on exhibition at once, and this enables the bench of experts to make the necessary comparisons and arrive at a verdict. The successful competitor gets the prize which I have before mentioned, and an abundance of applause and envy along with it. The negroes have a name for this grave deportment-tournament; a name taken from the prize contended for. They call it a Cake-walk. This Shelley biography is a literary cake-walk. The ordinary forms of speech are absent from it. All the pages, all the paragraphs, walk by sedately, elegantly, not to say mincingly, in their Sunday-best, shiny and sleek, perfumed, and with boutonnieres in their button-holes; it is rare to find even a chance sentence that has forgotten to dress. If the book wishes to tell us that Mary Godwin, child of sixteen, had known afflictions, the fact saunters forth in this nobby outfit: “Mary was herself not unlearned in the lore of pain”--meaning by that that she had not always traveled on asphalt; or, as some authorities would frame it, that she had “been there herself,” a form which, while preferable to the book's form, is still not to be recommended. If the book wishes to tell us that Harriet Shelley hired a wet-nurse, that commonplace fact gets turned into a dancing-master, who does his professional bow before us in pumps and knee-breeches, with his fiddle under one arm and his crush-hat under the other, thus: “The beauty of Harriet's motherly relation to her babe was marred in Shelley's eyes by the introduction into his house of a hireling nurse to whom was delegated the mother's tenderest office.” This is perhaps the strangest book that has seen the light since Frankenstein. Indeed, it is a Frankenstein itself; a Frankenstein with the original infirmity supplemented by a new one; a Frankenstein with the reasoning faculty wanting. Yet it believes it can reason, and is always trying. It is not content to leave a mountain of fact standing in the clear sunshine, where the simplest reader can perceive its form, its details, and its relation to the rest of the landscape, but thinks it must help him examine it and understand it; so its drifting mind settles upon it with that intent, but always with one and the same result: there is a change of temperature and the mountain is hid in a fog. Every time it sets up a premise and starts to reason from it, there is a surprise in store for the reader. It is strangely nearsighted, cross-eyed, and purblind. Sometimes when a mastodon walks across the field of its vision it takes it for a rat; at other times it does not see it at all. The materials of this biographical fable are facts, rumors, and poetry. They are connected together and harmonized by the","The judges
are the most critical of the spectators, and they have been trained to be
so, and they are the ones who decide the prize. They are the ones
who are supposed to be the most expert in the art of being good, and
the one who has the most points is the one who wins the cake. The
prize is a large cake, and the judges are supposed to be the most
experts in the art of being good. Now, I have no doubt that the most
experts in the art of being good are the professors of literature, and
the most experts in the art of being fine are the authors of books that
are supposed to be fine. So I will take this competition for the prize of
cake, and the judges of the contest will be the professors of literature
and the authors of books that are supposed to be fine. I will
take the subject of the contest to be the life of Percy Bysshe Shelley, and
I will submit the candidates for the prize to be the various books that
have been written on the life of Shelley, and the prize will be the
reputation that the authors of these books have, and the judges will be
the professors of literature and the authors of books that are supposed
to be fine. The competition will be, then, a contest in the art of being
fine, in which the candidates for the prize will be the books that have
been written on the life of Shelley, and the prize will be the reputation
that these books have. The judges will be the professors of literature and the authors of books that are
supposed to be fine. And this is the way I have come to the conclusion
that the book I have written, ""The Life of Harriet Shelley,"" is the
winner of the competition. I have not been able to find a single book that has been written on the life of
Shelley that",483,500,340,0.1025,0.1231,0.9669,0.8966,0.9957,0.8007,-0.117,6.7778,0.3469,0.2863,0.0407,0.0595,0.0021,0.0054,0.5914,0.3743,0.9723,0.9554,0.4803738317757009,0.4738675958188153,0.6185286103542235,8,7,0.9494,0.9477,0.11180124223602485,0.16,0.07941176470588235,0.9606,0.4665,29-05-2025

by Mark Twain




     [Left out of A Tramp Abroad, because it was feared that some
     of the particulars had been exaggerated, and that others
     were not true. Before these suspicions had been proven
     groundless, the book had gone to press. --M. T.]





I. The following curious history was related to me by a chance railway
acquaintance. He was a gentleman more than seventy years of age, and his
thoroughly good and gentle face and earnest and sincere manner imprinted
the unmistakable stamp of truth upon every statement which fell from his
lips. He said:

You know in what reverence the royal white elephant of Siam is held by
the people of that country. You know it is sacred to kings, only kings
may possess it, and that it is, indeed, in a measure even superior to
kings, since it receives not merely honor but worship. Very well; five
years ago, when the troubles concerning the frontier line arose between
Great Britain and Siam, it was presently manifest that Siam had been in
the wrong. Therefore every reparation was quickly made, and the British
representative stated that he was satisfied and the past should be
forgotten. This greatly relieved the King of Siam, and partly as a token
of gratitude, but partly also, perhaps, to wipe out any little remaining
vestige of unpleasantness which England might feel toward him, he wished
to send the Queen a present--the sole sure way of propitiating an enemy,
according to Oriental ideas. This present ought not only to be a royal
one, but transcendently royal. Wherefore, what offering could be so meet
as that of a white elephant? My position in the Indian civil service was
such that I was deemed peculiarly worthy of the honor of conveying the
present to her Majesty. A ship was fitted out for me and my servants and
the officers and attendants of the elephant, and in due time I arrived
in New York harbor and placed my royal charge in admirable quarters in
Jersey City. It was necessary to remain awhile in order to recruit the
animal's health before resuming the voyage. All went well during a fortnight--then my calamities began. The white
elephant was stolen! I was called up at dead of night and informed
of this fearful misfortune. For some moments I was beside myself with
terror and anxiety; I was helpless. Then I grew calmer and collected
my faculties. I soon saw my course--for, indeed, there was but the one
course for an intelligent man to pursue. Late as it was, I flew to
New York and got a policeman to conduct me to the headquarters of the
detective force. Fortunately I arrived in time, though the chief of the
force, the celebrated Inspector Blunt was just on the point of leaving
for his home.","me. He was a man of middle size and compact frame, and when he was thinking deeply he had a way of kniting his brows and tapping his forehead reflectively with his finger, which impressed you at once with the conviction that you stood in the presence of a person of no common order. The very sight of him gave me confidence and made me hopeful. I stated my errand. It did not flurry him in the least; it had no more visible effect upon his iron self-possession than if I had told him somebody had stolen my dog. He motioned me to a seat, and said, calmly: “Allow me to think a moment, please.” So saying, he sat down at his office table and leaned his head upon his hand. Several clerks were at work at the other end of the room; the scratching of their pens was all the sound I heard during the next six or seven minutes. Meantime the inspector sat there, buried in thought. Finally he raised his head, and there was that in the firm lines of his face which showed me that his brain had done its work and his plan was made. Said he--and his voice was low and impressive: “This is no ordinary case. Every step must be warily taken; each step must be made sure before the next is ventured. And secrecy must be observed--secrecy profound and absolute. Speak to no one about the matter, not even the reporters. I will take care of them; I will see that they get only what it may suit my ends to let them know.” He touched a bell; a youth appeared. “Alaric, tell the reporters to remain for the present.” The boy retired. “Now let us proceed to business--and systematically. Nothing can be accomplished in this trade of mine without strict and minute method.” He took a pen and some paper. “Now--name of the elephant?” “Hassan Ben Ali Ben Selim Abdallah Mohammed Moisé Alhammal Jamsetjejeebhoy Dhuleep Sultan Ebu Bhudpoor.” “Very well. Given name?” “Jumbo.” “Very well. Place of birth?” “The capital city of Siam.” “Parents living?” “No--dead.” “Had they any other issue besides this one?” “None. He was an only child.” “Very well. These matters are sufficient under that head. Now please describe the elephant, and leave out no particular, however insignificant--that is, insignificant from your point of view. To men in my profession there are no insignificant particulars; they do not exist.” I described, he wrote. When I was done, he said: “Now listen. If I have made any mistakes, correct me.” He read as follows: “Height, 19 feet; length from apex of forehead to insertion of tail, 26 feet; length of trunk, 16 feet; length of tail, 6 feet; total length, including trunk, and tail, 48 feet; length of tusks, 9 1/2 feet; ears keeping with these dimensions; footprint resembles the mark left when one up-ends a barrel in the snow; color of the elephant, a dull white; has a","I had to wait for him, and then we took a walk through the
streets of the city. The streets were quiet and dark, and the
moonlight poured in through the windows of the city buildings, which
were in the old, quaint, quaint style, and the street lamps were in a
state of decay, and the whole city was in a very peaceful and
serene condition. The police were very much in the dark as to the
nature of the crime, and I had to explain the situation to them, and
they were quite unable to see the importance of it. They were quite
unaccustomed to such a case. They could not conceive of a thief who
would steal a white elephant. They said that such a thing could not be
possible, that the animal was a white elephant, and that no one could
have taken it. I had to explain that it was not the color of the
elephant which was the matter, but the fact that it was a white
elephant, and that the animal was the subject of royal law, and that it
was an offense to steal it, and that the thieves had committed a
capital offense. They could not understand why it was a crime to steal
a white elephant. Then I explained that in Siam it is not only a crime
to steal a white elephant, but that it is a crime to even speak of it,
and that the animal is held in such reverence that the very mention of
its name is a crime. They could not understand this, and were
convinced that the thief was a man of imagination. But I was not
so easily discredited. I had the support of the British Government,
and, in the end, the detective force, after some time, became more
convinced that the case was serious. Then the detective force
took the matter into their hands, and, after some time, they found",474,500,327,0.094,0.1826,0.9615,0.9658,0.6338,0.7601,-7.001,6.0338,0.3203,0.3408,0.0326,0.072,0.0029,0.0086,0.3093,0.692,0.9773,0.9828,0.44672897196261685,0.40064620355411956,0.5643835616438356,8,9,0.9303,0.9283,0.1371308016877637,0.198,0.1162079510703364,0.9577,0.5944,29-05-2025
Mark_Twain,A Dog's Tale.txt,"A DOG'S TALE

by Mark Twain




CHAPTER I

My father was a St. Bernard, my mother was a collie, but I am a
Presbyterian. This is what my mother told me, I do not know these nice
distinctions myself. To me they are only fine large words meaning
nothing. My mother had a fondness for such; she liked to say them, and
see other dogs look surprised and envious, as wondering how she got so
much education. But, indeed, it was not real education; it was only
show: she got the words by listening in the dining-room and drawing-room
when there was company, and by going with the children to Sunday-school
and listening there; and whenever she heard a large word she said it over
to herself many times, and so was able to keep it until there was a
dogmatic gathering in the neighborhood, then she would get it off, and
surprise and distress them all, from pocket-pup to mastiff, which
rewarded her for all her trouble. If there was a stranger he was nearly
sure to be suspicious, and when he got his breath again he would ask her
what it meant. And she always told him. He was never expecting this but
thought he would catch her; so when she told him, he was the one that
looked ashamed, whereas he had thought it was going to be she. The
others were always waiting for this, and glad of it and proud of her, for
they knew what was going to happen, because they had had experience. When she told the meaning of a big word they were all so taken up with
admiration that it never occurred to any dog to doubt if it was the right
one; and that was natural, because, for one thing, she answered up so
promptly that it seemed like a dictionary speaking, and for another
thing, where could they find out whether it was right or not? for she was
the only cultivated dog there was. By and by, when I was older, she
brought home the word Unintellectual, one time, and worked it pretty hard
all the week at different gatherings, making much unhappiness and
despondency; and it was at this time that I noticed that during that week
she was asked for the meaning at eight different assemblages, and flashed
out a fresh definition every time, which showed me that she had more
presence of mind than culture, though I said nothing, of course. She had
one word which she always kept on hand, and ready, like a life-preserver,
a kind of emergency word to strap on when she was likely to get washed
overboard in a sudden way--that was the word Synonymous.","nonymous. When she happened to fetch out a long word which had had its day weeks before and its prepared meanings gone to her dump-pile, if there was a stranger there of course it knocked him groggy for a couple of minutes, then he would come to, and by that time she would be away down wind on another tack, and not expecting anything; so when he'd hail and ask her to cash in, I (the only dog on the inside of her game) could see her canvas flicker a moment--but only just a moment--then it would belly out taut and full, and she would say, as calm as a summer's day, “It's synonymous with supererogation,” or some godless long reptile of a word like that, and go placidly about and skim away on the next tack, perfectly comfortable, you know, and leave that stranger looking profane and embarrassed, and the initiated slatting the floor with their tails in unison and their faces transfigured with a holy joy. And it was the same with phrases. She would drag home a whole phrase, if it had a grand sound, and play it six nights and two matinees, and explain it a new way every time--which she had to, for all she cared for was the phrase; she wasn't interested in what it meant, and knew those dogs hadn't wit enough to catch her, anyway. Yes, she was a daisy! She got so she wasn't afraid of anything, she had such confidence in the ignorance of those creatures. She even brought anecdotes that she had heard the family and the dinner-guests laugh and shout over; and as a rule she got the nub of one chestnut hitched onto another chestnut, where, of course, it didn't fit and hadn't any point; and when she delivered the nub she fell over and rolled on the floor and laughed and barked in the most insane way, while I could see that she was wondering to herself why it didn't seem as funny as it did when she first heard it. But no harm was done; the others rolled and barked too, privately ashamed of themselves for not seeing the point, and never suspecting that the fault was not with them and there wasn't any to see. You can see by these things that she was of a rather vain and frivolous character; still, she had virtues, and enough to make up, I think. She had a kind heart and gentle ways, and never harbored resentments for injuries done her, but put them easily out of her mind and forgot them; and she taught her children her kindly way, and from her we learned also to be brave and prompt in time of danger, and not to run away, but face the peril that threatened friend or stranger, and help him the best we could without stopping to think what the cost might be to us. And she taught us not by words only, but by","But this was
only a word, and I never could get the meaning of that word. It is a
word that has no meaning, and I do not know how the other dogs ever
could get the meaning of it. But it is the only word that I can find in the
entire English language that is not a real word, and I suppose that is the
reason it is so popular. But I do not know that. I have no doubt that it is
a real word, but it is a word that has no meaning, and that is not the same
thing. So the word Synonymous, for all its name, has no meaning. I don't
know how the other dogs ever got the meaning of it. I don't know what
they meant by it. It is a word that has no meaning, but I don't know that
it is not a real word. The word is not a real word, and yet it is a real
word. That is the puzzle. That is the paradox. That is the enigma. That
is the riddle. That is the mystery. That is the problem. That is the

a. Man the Machine. b. Personal Merit

[The Old Man and the Young Man had been conversing. The Old Man had
asserted that the human being is merely a machine, and nothing more. The Young Man objected, and asked him to go into particulars and
furnish his reasons for his position.]

Old Man. What are the materials of which a steam-engine is made? Young Man. Iron, steel, brass, white-metal, and so on. O.M. Where are these found? Y.M. In the rocks. O.M. In a pure state? Y.M. No—in ores. O.M. Are the metals suddenly deposited in the ores? Y.M. No—it is the patient work of countless ages. O.M. You could make the engine out of the rocks themselves? Y.M. Yes, a brittle one and not valuable. O.M. You would not require much, of such an engine as that? Y.M. No—substantially nothing. O.M. To make a fine and capable engine, how would you proceed? Y.M. Drive tunnels and shafts into the hills; blast out the iron ore;
crush it, smelt it, reduce it to pig-iron; put some of it through the
Bessemer process and make steel of it. Mine and treat and combine
several metals of which brass is made. O.M. Then? Y.M. Out of the perfected result, build the fine engine. O.M. You would require much of this one? Y.M. Oh, indeed yes. O.M. It could drive lathes, drills, planers, punches, polishers, in a
word all the cunning machines of a great factory? Y.M. It could. O.M. What could the stone engine do? Y.M. Drive a sewing-machine, possibly—nothing more, perhaps. O.M. Men would admire the other engine and rapturously praise it? Y.M. Yes. O.M. But not the stone one? Y.M. No. O.M. The merits of the metal machine would be far above those of the
stone one? Y.M. Of course. O.M. Personal merits? Y.M. _Personal_ merits? How do you mean? O.M. It would be personally entitled to the credit of its own
performance? Y.M. The engine? Certainly not. O.M. Why not? Y.M. Because its performance is not personal. It is the result of the
law of construction. It is not a _merit_ that it does the things which
it is set to do—it can’t _help_ doing them. O.M. And it is not a personal demerit in the stone machine that it does
so little? Y.M. Certainly not.","oes so little? Y.M. Certainly not. It does no more and no less than the law of its make permits and compels it to do. There is nothing _personal_ about it; it cannot choose. In this process of “working up to the matter” is it your idea to work up to the proposition that man and a machine are about the same thing, and that there is no personal merit in the performance of either? O.M. Yes—but do not be offended; I am meaning no offense. What makes the grand difference between the stone engine and the steel one? Shall we call it training, education? Shall we call the stone engine a savage and the steel one a civilized man? The original rock contained the stuff of which the steel one was built—but along with a lot of sulphur and stone and other obstructing inborn heredities, brought down from the old geologic ages—prejudices, let us call them. Prejudices which nothing within the rock itself had either _power_ to remove or any _desire_ to remove. Will you take note of that phrase? Y.M. Yes. I have written it down; “Prejudices which nothing within the rock itself had either power to remove or any desire to remove.” Go on. O.M. Prejudices must be removed by _outside influences_ or not at all. Put that down. Y.M. Very well; “Must be removed by outside influences or not at all.” Go on. O.M. The iron’s prejudice against ridding itself of the cumbering rock. To make it more exact, the iron’s absolute _indifference_ as to whether the rock be removed or not. Then comes the _outside influence_ and grinds the rock to powder and sets the ore free. The _iron_ in the ore is still captive. An _outside influence_ smelts it free of the clogging ore. The iron is emancipated iron, now, but indifferent to further progress. An _outside influence_ beguiles it into the Bessemer furnace and refines it into steel of the first quality. It is educated, now—its training is complete. And it has reached its limit. By no possible process can it be educated into _gold_. Will you set that down? Y.M. Yes. “Everything has its limit—iron ore cannot be educated into gold.” O.M. There are gold men, and tin men, and copper men, and leaden men, and steel men, and so on—and each has the limitations of his nature, his heredities, his training, and his environment. You can build engines out of each of these metals, and they will all perform, but you must not require the weak ones to do equal work with the strong ones. In each case, to get the best results, you must free the metal from its obstructing prejudicial ones by education—smelting, refining, and so forth. Y.M. You have arrived at man, now? O.M. Yes. Man the machine—man the impersonal engine. Whatsoever a man is, is due to his _make_, and to the _influences_ brought to bear upon it by his heredities, his habitat, his associations. He is","O.M. Then, is the human being a machine? Y.M. He is, and more than that. He is a machine with a mind, and a
mind with a will, and a will with a conscience. O.M. A machine with a mind? Y.M. Yes, but not a mind of the kind that can be described in the
text-books of the natural philosophy. O.M. Then, what is man? Y.M. He is a machine, and a mind, and a will, and a conscience. O.M. What is the mind? Y.M. It is the thing that thinks. O.M. What is the will? Y.M. It is the thing that wants. O.M. What is the conscience? Y.M. It is the thing that knows right from wrong. O.M. Then, what is man? Y.M. He is a machine with a mind, with a will, with a conscience. O.M. Then, if a man is a machine, why does he not act as a machine?
Y.M. Because the machine is not a machine. O.M. Then, what is he? Y.M. He is a machine with a mind, with a will, with a conscience.

[The conversation ended.]

WHAT IS MAN? II

[The same old and young man, but the old man had changed his mind. The young man had also changed his mind.]

Old Man. I have been thinking, and I think I have come to a new

When I was twenty-seven years old, I was a mining-broker’s clerk in San
Francisco, and an expert in all the details of stock traffic. I was
alone in the world, and had nothing to depend upon but my wits and a
clean reputation; but these were setting my feet in the road to eventual
fortune, and I was content with the prospect. My time was my own after the afternoon board, Saturdays, and I was
accustomed to put it in on a little sail-boat on the bay. One day I
ventured too far, and was carried out to sea. Just at nightfall, when
hope was about gone, I was picked up by a small brig which was bound for
London. It was a long and stormy voyage, and they made me work my
passage without pay, as a common sailor. When I stepped ashore in London
my clothes were ragged and shabby, and I had only a dollar in my pocket. This money fed and sheltered me twenty-four hours. During the next
twenty-four I went without food and shelter. About ten o’clock on the following morning, seedy and hungry, I was
dragging myself along Portland Place, when a child that was passing,
towed by a nursemaid, tossed a luscious big pear—minus one bite—into the
gutter. I stopped, of course, and fastened my desiring eye on that muddy
treasure. My mouth watered for it, my stomach craved it, my whole being
begged for it. But every time I made a move to get it some passing eye
detected my purpose, and of course I straightened up, then, and looked
indifferent, and pretended that I hadn’t been thinking about the pear at
all. This same thing kept happening and happening, and I couldn’t get
the pear. I was just getting desperate enough to brave all the shame,
and to seize it, when a window behind me was raised, and a gentleman
spoke out of it, saying:

‘Step in here, please.’

I was admitted by a gorgeous flunkey, and shown into a sumptuous room
where a couple of elderly gentlemen were sitting. They sent away the
servant, and made me sit down. They had just finished their breakfast,
and the sight of the remains of it almost overpowered me. I could hardly
keep my wits together in the presence of that food, but as I was not
asked to sample it, I had to bear my trouble as best I could.",". Now, something had been happening there a little before, which I did not know anything about until a good many days afterwards, but I will tell you about it now. Those two old brothers had been having a pretty hot argument a couple of days before, and had ended by agreeing to decide it by a bet, which is the English way of settling everything. You will remember that the Bank of England once issued two notes of a million pounds each, to be used for a special purpose connected with some public transaction with a foreign country. For some reason or other only one of these had been used and cancelled; the other still lay in the vaults of the Bank. Well, the brothers, chatting along, happened to get to wondering what might be the fate of a perfectly honest and intelligent stranger who should be turned adrift in London without a friend, and with no money but that million-pound bank-note, and no way to account for his being in possession of it. Brother A said he would starve to death; Brother B said he wouldn’t. Brother A said he couldn’t offer it at a bank or anywhere else, because he would be arrested on the spot. So they went on disputing till Brother B said he would bet twenty thousand pounds that the man would live thirty days, _any way_, on that million, and keep out of jail, too. Brother A took him up. Brother B went down to the Bank and bought that note. Just like an Englishman, you see; pluck to the backbone. Then he dictated a letter, which one of his clerks wrote out in a beautiful round hand, and then the two brothers sat at the window a whole day watching for the right man to give it to. They saw many honest faces go by that were not intelligent enough; many that were intelligent but not honest enough; many that were both, but the possessors were not poor enough, or, if poor enough, were not strangers. There was always a defect, until I came along; but they agreed that I filled the bill all around; so they elected me unanimously, and there I was, now, waiting to know why I was called in. They began to ask me questions about myself, and pretty soon they had my story. Finally they told me I would answer their purpose. I said I was sincerely glad, and asked what it was. Then one of them handed me an envelope, and said I would find the explanation inside. I was going to open it, but he said no; take it to my lodgings, and look it over carefully, and not be hasty or rash. I was puzzled, and wanted to discuss the matter a little further, but they didn’t; so I took my leave, feeling hurt and insulted to be made the butt of what was apparently some kind of a practical joke, and yet obliged","One of the
gentlemen said:

‘We have been looking for a man who is expert in the stock market. We
have heard of you. We are the directors of the British Bank of Trade.

‘We have a proposition to make. We would like to give you a job, and
perhaps to make you a partner. We are in need of a man who has been in
the stock market, and we think you are the man. You have been in the
stock market, haven’t you?’

I said, yes, and that I had been a clerk in the San Francisco stock
exchange. Then I was given the first instalment of my salary, which was
£1,000,000, and I was told to keep it in my pocket, and that I was to go
home and rest, and that I would be called for the next day. The
gentlemen then said that I might go home, and that they would call for me
the next day. I went home, and I had the £1,000,000 in my pocket. I
could not keep it in my mind, and I was very much excited. I went into
my room, and I was so excited that I could not sleep. I lay there
thinking over what had happened. I thought of my life in San Francisco,
of the hard work and the toil, and the little salary I had earned, and of
my present life, of the comforts and luxuries, of the ease of my
situation, and of the fact that I had in my pocket the money that would
buy me a life of comfort for the rest of my days. I was so excited that I
could not sleep, and I was so excited that I could not even think of
sleeping. I had a feeling that I would not be able to sleep, and that I
would be too",476,500,314,0.065,0.0874,0.9497,0.9618,0.9653,0.7188,-0.9053,-7.3406,0.3069,0.2819,0.0236,0.0544,0.0,0.0067,0.552,0.4826,0.9744,0.9745,0.45604395604395603,0.4868651488616462,0.5574229691876751,8,8,0.9758,0.976,0.15756302521008403,0.136,0.1337579617834395,0.9147,0.6127,29-05-2025

HOW TO TELL A STORY

          The Humorous Story an American Development.--Its Difference
          from Comic and Witty Stories. I do not claim that I can tell a story as it ought to be told. I only
claim to know how a story ought to be told, for I have been almost daily
in the company of the most expert story-tellers for many years. There are several kinds of stories, but only one difficult kind--the
humorous. I will talk mainly about that one. The humorous story is
American, the comic story is English, the witty story is French. The
humorous story depends for its effect upon the manner of the telling;
the comic story and the witty story upon the matter. The humorous story may be spun out to great length, and may wander
around as much as it pleases, and arrive nowhere in particular; but the
comic and witty stories must be brief and end with a point. The humorous
story bubbles gently along, the others burst. The humorous story is strictly a work of art--high and delicate art--and
only an artist can tell it; but no art is necessary in telling the comic
and the witty story; anybody can do it. The art of telling a humorous
story--understand, I mean by word of mouth, not print--was created in
America, and has remained at home. The humorous story is told gravely; the teller does his best to conceal
the fact that he even dimly suspects that there is anything funny about
it; but the teller of the comic story tells you beforehand that it is
one of the funniest things he has ever heard, then tells it with eager
delight, and is the first person to laugh when he gets through. And
sometimes, if he has had good success, he is so glad and happy that
he will repeat the “nub” of it and glance around from face to face,
collecting applause, and then repeat it again. It is a pathetic thing to
see. Very often, of course, the rambling and disjointed humorous story
finishes with a nub, point, snapper, or whatever you like to call it. Then the listener must be alert, for in many cases the teller will
divert attention from that nub by dropping it in a carefully casual and
indifferent way, with the pretence that he does not know it is a nub. Artemus Ward used that trick a good deal; then when the belated audience
presently caught the joke he would look up with innocent surprise, as if
wondering what they had found to laugh at. Dan Setchell used it before
him, Nye and Riley and others use it to-day. But the teller of the comic story does not slur the nub; he shouts it at
you--every time.","y time. And when he prints it, in England, France, Germany, and Italy, he italicizes it, puts some whooping exclamation-points after it, and sometimes explains it in a parenthesis. All of which is very depressing, and makes one want to renounce joking and lead a better life. Let me set down an instance of the comic method, using an anecdote which has been popular all over the world for twelve or fifteen hundred years. The teller tells it in this way: THE WOUNDED SOLDIER. In the course of a certain battle a soldier whose leg had been shot off appealed to another soldier who was hurrying by to carry him to the rear, informing him at the same time of the loss which he had sustained; whereupon the generous son of Mars, shouldering the unfortunate, proceeded to carry out his desire. The bullets and cannon-balls were flying in all directions, and presently one of the latter took the wounded man's head off--without, however, his deliverer being aware of it. In no-long time he was hailed by an officer, who said: “Where are you going with that carcass?” “To the rear, sir--he's lost his leg!” “His leg, forsooth?” responded the astonished officer; “you mean his head, you booby.” Whereupon the soldier dispossessed himself of his burden, and stood looking down upon it in great perplexity. At length he said: “It is true, sir, just as you have said.” Then after a pause he added, “But he TOLD me IT WAS HIS LEG--” Here the narrator bursts into explosion after explosion of thunderous horse-laughter, repeating that nub from time to time through his gaspings and shriekings and suffocatings. It takes only a minute and a half to tell that in its comic-story form; and isn't worth the telling, after all. Put into the humorous-story form it takes ten minutes, and is about the funniest thing I have ever listened to--as James Whitcomb Riley tells it. He tells it in the character of a dull-witted old farmer who has just heard it for the first time, thinks it is unspeakably funny, and is trying to repeat it to a neighbor. But he can't remember it; so he gets all mixed up and wanders helplessly round and round, putting in tedious details that don't belong in the tale and only retard it; taking them out conscientiously and putting in others that are just as useless; making minor mistakes now and then and stopping to correct them and explain how he came to make them; remembering things which he forgot to put in in their proper place and going back to put them in there; stopping his narrative a good while in order to try to recall the name of the soldier that was hurt, and finally remembering that the soldier's name was not mentioned, and remarking placidly that the name is of no real importance, anyway--better, of course, if one knew it, but not essential, after all--and so on, and so on, and so","He is sure that the whole thing is a joke, and he tells
it with the same eagerness and enthusiasm that a preacher would tell
a sermon. The funny is the whole thing, the whole point of the story. The humorous story is not so much about the funny as it is about the
telling. The humorous story is the story that has a little of everything
in it; the comic story is the story that is all funny. The humorous
story is a work of art, the comic story is a mere trick, the witty
story is a puzzle. The humorous story is the most American of all
stories, and the most American of all stories is the story of the
wounded soldier. The wounded soldier story is the most natural and
the most easily understood of all stories, and is the one that
everybody knows. The wounded soldier is the American, the Englishman
is the comic, the Frenchman is the witty. The humorous story is
never told with any hurry, it is always told in a slow and deliberate
manner. The comic story is told with haste, with the idea that the
teller is in a hurry to get the joke over. The witty story is told
with the idea that the listener is not to know the joke until the end.
The humorous story is told in a natural manner, the comic story in a
stage manner, the witty story with a studied air of mystery. The
humorous story is the only story that is not a story, because it is
not a story but a performance. The comic story is a story, and the
witty story is a puzzle. The humorous story is not a story, it is a
performance, and is not meant to be read. The comic story is a story
and is meant to be read. The witty story is a puzzle, and is not meant
to be read. The humorous story is a thing of",490,500,333,0.0828,0.7273,0.9617,0.9134,0.8687,0.74,3.7778,-6.5,0.3659,0.4443,0.0555,0.1539,0.0068,0.0596,0.593,0.8311,0.9762,0.9492,0.4517857142857143,0.4671163575042159,0.5244565217391305,8,7,0.954,0.8739,0.14489795918367346,0.182,0.10510510510510511,0.8504,0.5124,29-05-2025

A Whisper

to the Reader. There is no character, howsoever good and fine, but it can be destroyed
by ridicule, howsoever poor and witless. Observe the ass, for instance:
his character is about perfect, he is the choicest spirit among all the
humbler animals, yet see what ridicule has brought him to. Instead of
feeling complimented when we are called an ass, we are left in 
doubt.--Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar. A person who is ignorant of legal matters is always liable to make
mistakes when he tries to photograph a court scene with his pen; and so
I was not willing to let the law chapters in this book go to press
without first subjecting them to rigid and exhausting revision and
correction by a trained barrister--if that is what they are called. These chapters are right, now, in every detail, for they were rewritten
under the immediate eye of William Hicks, who studied law part of a
while in southwest Missouri thirty-five years ago and then came over
here to Florence for his health and is still helping for exercise and
board in Macaroni Vermicelli's horse-feed shed which is up the back
alley as you turn around the corner out of the Piazza del Duomo just
beyond the house where that stone that Dante used to sit on six hundred
years ago is let into the wall when he let on to be watching them build
Giotto's campanile and yet always got tired looking as soon as Beatrice
passed along on her way to get a chunk of chestnut cake to defend
herself with in case of a Ghibelline outbreak before she got to school,
at the same old stand where they sell the same old cake to this day and
it is just as light and good as it was then, too, and this is not
flattery, far from it.","it. He was a little rusty on his law, but he rubbed up for this book, and those two or three legal chapters are right and straight, now. He told me so himself. Given under my hand this second day of January, 1893, at the Villa Viviani, village of Settignano, three miles back of Florence, on the hills--the same certainly affording the most charming view to be found on this planet, and with it the most dreamlike and enchanting sunsets to be found in any planet or even in any solar system--and given, too, in the swell room of the house, with the busts of Cerretani senators and other grandees of this line looking approvingly down upon me as they used to look down upon Dante, and mutely asking me to adopt them into my family, which I do with pleasure, for my remotest ancestors are but spring chickens compared with these robed and stately antiques, and it will be a great and satisfying lift for me, that six hundred years will. Mark Twain. CHAPTER I. Pudd'nhead Wins His Name. Tell the truth or trump--but get the trick.--Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar. The scene of this chronicle is the town of Dawson's Landing, on the Missouri side of the Mississippi, half a day's journey, per steamboat, below St. Louis. In 1830 it was a snug little collection of modest one- and two-story frame dwellings whose whitewashed exteriors were almost concealed from sight by climbing tangles of rose-vines, honeysuckles, and morning-glories. Each of these pretty homes had a garden in front fenced with white palings and opulently stocked with hollyhocks, marigolds, touch-me-nots, prince's-feathers and other old-fashioned flowers; while on the window-sills of the houses stood wooden boxes containing moss-rose plants and terra-cotta pots in which grew a breed of geranium whose spread of intensely red blossoms accented the prevailing pink tint of the rose-clad house-front like an explosion of flame. When there was room on the ledge outside of the pots and boxes for a cat, the cat was there--in sunny weather--stretched at full length, asleep and blissful, with her furry belly to the sun and a paw curved over her nose. Then that house was complete, and its contentment and peace were made manifest to the world by this symbol, whose testimony is infallible. A home without a cat--and a well-fed, well-petted and properly revered cat--may be a perfect home, perhaps, but how can it prove title? All along the streets, on both sides, at the outer edge of the brick sidewalks, stood locust-trees with trunks protected by wooden boxing, and these furnished shade for summer and a sweet fragrance in spring when the clusters of buds came forth. The main street, one block back from the river, and running parallel with it, was the sole business street. It was six blocks long, and in each block two or three brick stores three stories high towered above interjected bunches of little frame shops. Swinging signs creaked in the wind, the street's whole","I have been trying to be as exact as I can be,

THE CURIOUS REPUBLIC OF GONDOUR

As soon as I had learned to speak the language a little, I became greatly interested in the people and the system of government. I found that the nation had at first tried universal suffrage pure and simple, but had thrown that form aside because the result was not satisfactory. It had seemed to deliver all power into the hands of the ignorant and non-tax-paying classes; and of a necessity the responsible offices were filled from these classes also. A remedy was sought. The people believed they had found it; not in the destruction of universal suffrage, but in the enlargement of it. It was an odd idea, and ingenious. You must understand, the constitution gave every man a vote; therefore that vote was a vested right, and could not be taken away. But the constitution did not say that certain individuals might not be given two votes, or ten! So an amendatory clause was inserted in a quiet way; a clause which authorised the enlargement of the suffrage in certain cases to be specified by statute. To offer to “limit” the suffrage might have made instant trouble; the offer to “enlarge” it had a pleasant aspect. But of course the newspapers soon began to suspect; and then out they came! It was found, however, that for once--and for the first time in the history of the republic--property, character, and intellect were able to wield a political influence; for once, money, virtue, and intelligence took a vital and a united interest in a political question; for once these powers went to the “primaries” in strong force; for once the best men in the nation were put forward as candidates for that parliament whose business it should be to enlarge the suffrage. The weightiest half of the press quickly joined forces with the new movement, and left the other half to rail about the proposed “destruction of the liberties” of the bottom layer of society, the hitherto governing class of the community. The victory was complete. The new law was framed and passed.","passed. Under it every citizen, howsoever poor or ignorant, possessed one vote, so universal suffrage still reigned; but if a man possessed a good common-school education and no money, he had two votes; a high-school education gave him four; if he had property likewise, to the value of three thousand 'sacos,' he wielded one more vote; for every fifty thousand 'sacos' a man added to his property, he was entitled to another vote; a university education entitled a man to nine votes, even though he owned no property. Therefore, learning being more prevalent and more easily acquired than riches, educated men became a wholesome check upon wealthy men, since they could outvote them. Learning goes usually with uprightness, broad views, and humanity; so the learned voters, possessing the balance of power, became the vigilant and efficient protectors of the great lower rank of society. And now a curious thing developed itself--a sort of emulation, whose object was voting power! Whereas formerly a man was honored only according to the amount of money he possessed, his grandeur was measured now by the number of votes he wielded. A man with only one vote was conspicuously respectful to his neighbor who possessed three. And if he was a man above the common-place, he was as conspicuously energetic in his determination to acquire three for himself. This spirit of emulation invaded all ranks. Votes based upon capital were commonly called “mortal” votes, because they could be lost; those based upon learning were called “immortal,” because they were permanent, and because of their customarily imperishable character they were naturally more valued than the other sort. I say “customarily” for the reason that these votes were not absolutely imperishable, since insanity could suspend them. Under this system, gambling and speculation almost ceased in the republic. A man honoured as the possessor of great voting power could not afford to risk the loss of it upon a doubtful chance. It was curious to observe the manners and customs which the enlargement plan produced. Walking the street with a friend one day he delivered a careless bow to a passer-by, and then remarked that that person possessed only one vote and would probably never earn another; he was more respectful to the next acquaintance he met; he explained that this salute was a four-vote bow. I tried to “average” the importance of the people he accosted after that, by the nature of his bows, but my success was only partial, because of the somewhat greater homage paid to the immortals than to the mortals. My friend explained. He said there was no law to regulate this thing, except that most powerful of all laws, custom. Custom had created these varying bows, and in time they had become easy and natural. At this moment he delivered himself of a very profound salute, and then said, “Now there's a man who began life as a shoemaker's apprentice, and without education; now he swings twenty-two mortal votes and two immortal","It gave every man a vote, and also gave every man a vote for every man. That was the law. The law was that every man was to be allowed a vote for every man. That was the law.

The first effect of this law was to cause a great commotion in the country. The people were so surprised, and so bewildered, that they could not understand the law at first. A few of the more intelligent citizens, however, began to get the idea. They saw that a man was to be allowed to vote for every man, and that was a new thing. They began to see that the law was a new kind of law. They began to see that the law was not to be taken as a law, but as a new system. They began to see that the law was to be taken as a law, but that it was a law of a different kind.

The first thing that happened was that the people became very excited. They began to think that they were to be made to vote for every man, and that they were to be made to vote for every man in the country. The idea was so new that they could not grasp it. They thought that the law was to be interpreted in a different way, but they did not know what way. They could not understand the law at all. They could not find any law that had ever been passed that was so different from all other laws. They could not find any law that had ever been passed that had ever been so different from all other laws. They could not find any law that had ever been passed that had ever been so different from all other laws. They could not find any law that had ever been passed that had ever been so different from all other laws. They could not find any law that had ever been passed that had ever been so different from all other laws.

BURLESQUE AUTOBIOGRAPHY


AWFUL, TERRIBLE MEDIEVAL ROMANCE

CHAPTER I. THE SECRET REVEALED. CHAPTER II. FESTIVITY AND TEARS

CHAPTER III. THE PLOT THICKENS. CHAPTER IV. THE AWFUL REVELATION. CHAPTER V. THE FRIGHTFUL CATASTROPHE. BURLESQUE AUTOBIOGRAPHY. Two or three persons having at different times intimated that if I would
write an autobiography they would read it, when they got leisure, I
yield at last to this frenzied public demand, and herewith tender my
history:

Ours is a noble old house, and stretches a long way back into antiquity. The earliest ancestor the Twains have any record of was a friend of the
family by the name of Higgins. This was in the eleventh century, when
our people were living in Aberdeen, county of Cork, England. Why it is
that our long line has ever since borne the maternal name (except when
one of them now and then took a playful refuge in an alias to avert
foolishness), instead of Higgins, is a mystery which none of us has ever
felt much desire to stir. It is a kind of vague, pretty romance, and we
leave it alone. All the old families do that way. Arthour Twain was a man of considerable note--a solicitor on the highway
in William Rufus' time. At about the age of thirty he went to one of
those fine old English places of resort called Newgate, to see about
something, and never returned again. While there he died suddenly. Augustus Twain, seems to have made something of a stir about the year
1160. He was as full of fun as he could be, and used to take his old
sabre and sharpen it up, and get in a convenient place on a dark night,
and stick it through people as they went by, to see them jump. He was a
born humorist. But he got to going too far with it; and the first time
he was found stripping one of these parties, the authorities removed one
end of him, and put it up on a nice high place on Temple Bar, where it
could contemplate the people and have a good time. He never liked any
situation so much or stuck to it so long. Then for the next two hundred years the family tree shows a succession
of soldiers--noble, high-spirited fellows, who always went into battle
singing; right behind the army, and always went out a-whooping, right
ahead of it. This is a scathing rebuke to old dead Froissart's poor witticism that
our family tree never had but one limb to it, and that that one stuck
out at right angles, and bore fruit winter, and summer. ||=======|====

                         OUR FAMILY TREE

Early in the fifteenth century we have Beau Twain, called “the Scholar.”
 He wrote a beautiful, beautiful hand.","He wrote a beautiful, beautiful hand. And he could imitate anybody's hand so closely that it was enough to make a person laugh his head off to see it. He had infinite sport with his talent. But by and by he took a contract to break stone for a road, and the roughness of the work spoiled his hand. Still, he enjoyed life all the time he was in the stone business, which, with inconsiderable intervals, was some forty-two years. In fact, he died in harness. During all those long years he gave such satisfaction that he never was through with one contract a week till government gave him another. He was a perfect pet. And he was always a favorite with his fellow-artists, and was a conspicuous member of their benevolent secret society, called the Chain Gang. He always wore his hair short, had a preference for striped clothes, and died lamented by the government. He was a sore loss to his country. For he was so regular. Some years later we have the illustrious John Morgan Twain. He came over to this country with Columbus in 1492, as a passenger. He appears to have been of a crusty, uncomfortable disposition. He complained of the food all the way over, and was always threatening to go ashore unless there was a change. He wanted fresh shad. Hardly a day passed over his head that he did not go idling about the ship with his nose in the air, sneering about the commander, and saying he did not believe Columbus knew where he was going to or had ever been there before. The memorable cry of “Land ho!” thrilled every heart in the ship but his. He gazed a while through a piece of smoked glass at the penciled line lying on the distant water, and then said: “Land be hanged,--it's a raft!” When this questionable passenger came on board the ship, he brought nothing with him but an old newspaper containing a handkerchief marked “B. G.,” one cotton sock marked “L. W. C.” one woollen one marked “D. F.” and a night-shirt marked “O. M. R.” And yet during the voyage he worried more about his “trunk,” and gave himself more airs about it, than all the rest of the passengers put together. If the ship was “down by the head,” and would not steer, he would go and move his “trunk” farther aft, and then watch the effect. If the ship was “by the stern,” he would suggest to Columbus to detail some men to “shift that baggage.” In storms he had to be gagged, because his wailings about his “trunk” made it impossible for the men to hear the orders. The man does not appear to have been openly charged with any gravely unbecoming thing, but it is noted in the ship's log as a “curious circumstance” that albeit he brought his baggage on board the ship in a newspaper, he took it ashore in four trunks,","He was a man of the world, and had
a fine sense of humor, and was not afraid of a little fun. He was the
first to introduce the use of the printing press in this country. He had
a son, who was a jester to the King. The King, in his kindness, gave
him a sword, and the jester said, “I do not want a sword.” The King
said, “Then I will give you a book.” The jester said, “I do not want a
book either.” The King said, “Then you are not a jester, but a fool.” The jester said, “Then I am a fool, and I am not a jester.” The King said, “Then I will give you a
sceptre.” The jester said, “I do not want a sceptre either.” The King said, “Then you are not a fool, but a man.” The jester said, “Then I am a man, and I am not a fool.” The King said, “Then I will give you a
crown.” The jester said, “I do not want a crown either.” The King said, “Then you are not a man, but a
king.” The jester said, “Then I am a king, and I am not a man.” The King said, “Then I will give you a
dagger.” The jester said, “I do not want a dagger either.” The King said, “Then you are not a king, but a
swordsman.” The jester said, “Then I am a swordsman, and I am not a king.” The King said, “Then I will give you a
sceptre.” The jester said, “I do not want a sceptre either.” The King said, “Then you are not a swordsman, but a
philosopher.”",490,500,283,0.1198,0.0057,0.9814,0.8682,0.825,0.6907,-2.9881,-5.2798,0.3118,0.1466,0.0452,0.0134,0.0055,0.0015,0.5037,0.303,0.9617,0.8966,0.38998211091234347,0.4491525423728814,0.4889502762430939,8,3,0.9909,0.979,0.1489795918367347,0.148,0.2049469964664311,0.8927,0.3301,29-05-2025

     FINAL REMARKS. A man who is not born with the novel-writing gift has a troublesome time
of it when he tries to build a novel. I know this from experience. He
has no clear idea of his story; in fact he has no story. He merely has
some people in his mind, and an incident or two, also a locality. He
knows these people, he knows the selected locality, and he trusts
that he can plunge those people into those incidents with interesting
results. So he goes to work. To write a novel? No--that is a thought
which comes later; in the beginning he is only proposing to tell a
little tale; a very little tale; a six-page tale. But as it is a tale
which he is not acquainted with, and can only find out what it is by
listening as it goes along telling itself, it is more than apt to go
on and on and on till it spreads itself into a book. I know about this,
because it has happened to me so many times. And I have noticed another thing: that as the short tale grows into a
long tale, the original intention (or motif) is apt to get abolished and
find itself superseded by a quite different one. It was so in the
case of a magazine sketch which I once started to write--a funny and
fantastic sketch about a prince and a pauper; it presently assumed a
grave cast of its own accord, and in that new shape spread itself out
into a book. Much the same thing happened with “Pudd'nhead Wilson.” I
had a sufficiently hard time with that tale, because it changed itself
from a farce to a tragedy while I was going along with it--a most
embarrassing circumstance. But what was a great deal worse was, that it
was not one story, but two stories tangled together; and they obstructed
and interrupted each other at every turn and created no end of confusion
and annoyance. I could not offer the book for publication, for I was
afraid it would unseat the reader's reason. I did not know what was the
matter with it, for I had not noticed, as yet, that it was two stories
in one. It took me months to make that discovery. I carried the
manuscript back and forth across the Atlantic two or three times, and
read it and studied over it on shipboard; and at last I saw where the
difficulty lay. I had no further trouble.","e difficulty lay. I had no further trouble. I pulled one of the stories out by the roots, and left the other one--a kind of literary Caesarean operation. Would the reader care to know something about the story which I pulled out? He has been told many a time how the born-and-trained novelist works. Won't he let me round and complete his knowledge by telling him how the jack-leg does it? Originally the story was called “Those Extraordinary Twins.” I meant to make it very short. I had seen a picture of a youthful Italian “freak” or “freaks” which was--or which were--on exhibition in our cities--a combination consisting of two heads and four arms joined to a single body and a single pair of legs--and I thought I would write an extravagantly fantastic little story with this freak of nature for hero--or heroes--a silly young miss for heroine, and two old ladies and two boys for the minor parts. I lavishly elaborated these people and their doings, of course. But the tale kept spreading along, and spreading along, and other people got to intruding themselves and taking up more and more room with their talk and their affairs. Among them came a stranger named Pudd'nhead Wilson, and a woman named Roxana; and presently the doings of these two pushed up into prominence a young fellow named Tom Driscoll, whose proper place was away in the obscure background. Before the book was half finished those three were taking things almost entirely into their own hands and working the whole tale as a private venture of their own--a tale which they had nothing at all to do with, by rights. When the book was finished and I came to look around to see what had become of the team I had originally started out with--Aunt Patsy Cooper, Aunt Betsy Hale, the two boys, and Rowena the light-weight heroine--they were nowhere to be seen; they had disappeared from the story some time or other. I hunted about and found them--found them stranded, idle, forgotten, and permanently useless. It was very awkward. It was awkward all around; but more particularly in the case of Rowena, because there was a love-match on, between her and one of the twins that constituted the freak, and I had worked it up to a blistering heat and thrown in a quite dramatic love-quarrel, wherein Rowena scathingly denounced her betrothed for getting drunk, and scoffed at his explanation of how it had happened, and wouldn't listen to it, and had driven him from her in the usual “forever” way; and now here she sat crying and broken-hearted; for she had found that he had spoken only the truth; that it was not he, but the other half of the freak, that had drunk the liquor that made him drunk; that her half was a prohibitionist and had never drunk a drop in his life, and, although tight as a brick three days in the week, was wholly innocent of","The book is now a success.
So, in short, the author must be very careful, when he is writing a
novel, not to be too hasty in starting out with a certain idea, and not
to let the story grow on its own. He must watch it closely, and
prevent it from getting out of hand. The author must also be very
careful not to let two stories get tangled in one. That is the one
danger which is most to be avoided. But the one thing that will not
happen is that a story will turn out to be a single story. If that is
the case, then it is a failure. A story is not a single story, but a
collection of many stories, and the author must be careful to make
each of them work. I am the author of this book, and I am not
afraid to say that it is a collection of many stories, and that I have
been very careful to make each of them work. I do not mean that the
stories are all different, or that they are all of a different kind.
I mean that each story is a different one, and that they are all
connected with the same main story. I mean that the stories are
interwoven, and that they are not isolated. I mean that the stories
are not like the parts of a pie, but like the threads of a tapestry. I
mean that the stories are not like the chapters of a book, but like
the scenes of a play. I mean that the stories are not like the
chapters of a book, but like the scenes of a play. I mean that the

PREFACE

I have scattered through this volume a mass of matter which has never
been in print before (such as “Learned Fables for Good Old Boys and
Girls,” the “Jumping Frog restored to the English tongue after martyrdom
in the French,” the “Membranous Croup” sketch, and many others which I
need not specify): not doing this in order to make an advertisement of
it, but because these things seemed instructive. HARTFORD, 1875. MARK TWAIN. SKETCHES NEW AND OLD




MY WATCH--[Written about 1870.]

AN INSTRUCTIVE LITTLE TALE

My beautiful new watch had run eighteen months without losing or gaining,
and without breaking any part of its machinery or stopping. I had come
to believe it infallible in its judgments about the time of day, and to
consider its constitution and its anatomy imperishable. But at last, one
night, I let it run down. I grieved about it as if it were a recognized
messenger and forerunner of calamity. But by and by I cheered up, set
the watch by guess, and commanded my bodings and superstitions to depart. Next day I stepped into the chief jeweler's to set it by the exact time,
and the head of the establishment took it out of my hand and proceeded to
set it for me. Then he said, “She is four minutes slow-regulator wants
pushing up.”  I tried to stop him--tried to make him understand that the
watch kept perfect time.","to make him understand that the watch kept perfect time. But no; all this human cabbage could see was that the watch was four minutes slow, and the regulator must be pushed up a little; and so, while I danced around him in anguish, and implored him to let the watch alone, he calmly and cruelly did the shameful deed. My watch began to gain. It gained faster and faster day by day. Within the week it sickened to a raging fever, and its pulse went up to a hundred and fifty in the shade. At the end of two months it had left all the timepieces of the town far in the rear, and was a fraction over thirteen days ahead of the almanac. It was away into November enjoying the snow, while the October leaves were still turning. It hurried up house rent, bills payable, and such things, in such a ruinous way that I could not abide it. I took it to the watchmaker to be regulated. He asked me if I had ever had it repaired. I said no, it had never needed any repairing. He looked a look of vicious happiness and eagerly pried the watch open, and then put a small dice-box into his eye and peered into its machinery. He said it wanted cleaning and oiling, besides regulating--come in a week. After being cleaned and oiled, and regulated, my watch slowed down to that degree that it ticked like a tolling bell. I began to be left by trains, I failed all appointments, I got to missing my dinner; my watch strung out three days' grace to four and let me go to protest; I gradually drifted back into yesterday, then day before, then into last week, and by and by the comprehension came upon me that all solitary and alone I was lingering along in week before last, and the world was out of sight. I seemed to detect in myself a sort of sneaking fellow-feeling for the mummy in the museum, and a desire to swap news with him. I went to a watchmaker again. He took the watch all to pieces while I waited, and then said the barrel was “swelled.” He said he could reduce it in three days. After this the watch averaged well, but nothing more. For half a day it would go like the very mischief, and keep up such a barking and wheezing and whooping and sneezing and snorting, that I could not hear myself think for the disturbance; and as long as it held out there was not a watch in the land that stood any chance against it. But the rest of the day it would keep on slowing down and fooling along until all the clocks it had left behind caught up again. So at last, at the end of twenty-four hours, it would trot up to the judges' stand all right and just in time. It would show a fair and","But he did not listen. He was a man of the
world, and he said, “I am not going to push it up, I am not going to
make a mistake. I will not risk it. I will not risk it. I will not risk it.”

I had been in that shop for ten minutes, and the man had not yet said
“risk it” three times.  I was getting very weary of the word, and I said:
“Mr. H—, I don't want you to push it up. I don't want you to risk it.”

He looked at me and said, “You don't want to risk it?”

I said, “No, I don't.”

He said, “Then I will not risk it.”

I was very surprised at that, and I said, “Why, Mr. H—, I think you
understand me.”

He said, “I think I do.”

I said, “Then you are not a man of the world.”

He said, “I am a man of the world.”

I said, “Then you are a man of the world, and yet you don't want to risk
it?”

He said, “I don't want to risk it.”

I said, “Then you are not a man of the world.”

He said, “I am a man of the world.”

And so it went on, back and forth, and I had to go.

This is a little story, but I think it is not a very insignificant one.  I
think it is a very instructive one.  I think it is a very instructive one.

Mark_Twain,"The Treaty With China, its Provisions ExplainedNew York Tribune, Tuesday, August 28, 1868.txt","THE TREATY WITH CHINA

ITS PROVISIONS EXPLAINED


New York Tribune, Tuesday, August 28, 1868


Every one has read the treaty which has just been concluded between
the United States and China. Everyone has read it, but in it there are
expressions which not every one understands. There are clauses which
seem vague, other clauses which seem almost unnecessary, and still
others which bear the flavor of “surplusage,” to speak in legal
phrase. The most careful reading of the document will leave these
impressions--that is, unless one comprehends the past and present
condition of foreign intercourse with China--in which case it will be
seen at once that there is no word in the treaty without a meaning,
and no clause in it but was dictated by a present need or a wise policy
looking to the future. It will interest many of your readers to know why
this, that, and the other provision was incorporated in the treaty;
it will interest others to know in what manner and to what extent the
treaty will affect our existing relations with China. Apart from its
grave importance, the subject is really as entertaining as any I know
of and--asking pardon for the presumption--I desire to write a
few paragraphs upon it. We made a treaty with China in 1858; Mr. Burlingame's new treaty is an addition to that one, and an amplification
of its powers. The first article of this new treaty reads as follows:

     ARTICLE I. His Majesty, the Emperor of China, being of the
     opinion that in making concessions to the citizens or
     subjects of foreign Powers of the privilege of residing on
     certain tracts of land, or resorting to certain waters of
     that Empire for the purposes of trade, he has by no means
     relinquished his right of eminent domain or dominion over
     the said land and waters, hereby agrees that no such
     concession or grant shall be construed to give to any Power
     or party which may be at war with or hostile to the United
     States the right to attack the citizens of the United States
     or their property within the said lands or waters; and the
     United States, for themselves, hereby agree to abstain from
     offensively attacking the citizens or subjects of any Power
     or party or their property with which they may be at war on
     any such tract of land or waters of the said Empire; but
     nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent the
     United States from resisting an attack by any hostile Power
     or party upon their citizens or their property.","It is further agreed that if any right or interest in any tract of land in China has been or shall hereafter be granted by the Government of China to the United States or their citizens for purposes of trade or commerce, that grant shall in no event be construed to divest the Chinese authorities of their right of jurisdiction over persons and property within said tract of land, except so far as that right may have been expressly relinquished by treaty. In or near one or two of the cities of China the Emperor has set apart certain tracts of land for occupation by foreigners. The foreigners residing upon these tracts create courts of justice, organize police forces, and govern themselves by laws of their own framing. They levy and collect taxes, they pave their streets, they light them with gas. These communities, through liberality of China, are so independent and so unshackled that they have all the seeming of colonies--insomuch that the jurisdiction of China over them was in time lost sight of and disregarded--at least, questioned. The English communities came to be looked upon as a part of England, and the American colonies as part of America; and so, after the Trent affair, it was seriously held by many that the Confederate ships of war would be as justifiable in making attacks upon the American communities in China as they would be in attacking New York or Boston. This doctrine was really held, notwithstanding the supremacy of China over these tracts of land was recognized at regular intervals in the most substantial way, viz., by way of payment to the Government of a stipulated rental. Again, these foreign communities took it upon themselves to levy taxes upon Chinamen residing upon their so-called “concessions,” and enforce their collection. Perhaps those Chinamen were as well governed as they have been anywhere in China, perhaps it was entirely just that they should pay for good government--but the principle was wrong; it was an encroachment upon the rights of the crown, and caused the Government uneasiness; the boundary thus passed there was no telling how far the encroachment might be pushed. The municipal council which taxed these Chinamen was composed altogether of foreigners, so there was taxation without representation--a policy which we fought seven years to overthrow. The French have persistently claimed the right to exercise untrammeled jurisdiction over both natives and foreigners residing within their “concessions,” but the present Minister, Monsieur Moustier, has yielded this position in favor of the anti-concession doctrine, and thus have ignored the “eminent dominion” of the Chinese Government. Under Article 1 of the new treaty, the question of whether an enemy of America can attack an American colony in China is answered in the negative. Under it the right of the Chinese Government to regulate the governing, taxing, and trying of its subjects resident within American “concessions” is recognized--in a word, its supreme control over its own people is recognized. Also (in the final sentence)","This is a long article, but it is not without meaning. It is a
treaty of mutual non-aggression in the case of any attack upon the
citizens of either of the two nations. The first part of the article
speaks of the Emperor of China agreeing that he will not allow any
enemy of the United States to attack their citizens or property in
the ports and waters of China. The second part of the article
speaks of the United States agreeing to do the same in regard to the
citizens of China. The whole article is a mutual agreement that in
the case of any attack upon the citizens of either of the two nations
in the ports and waters of China, the other nation shall not attack
them in return.

The article is in the form of a promise between the two nations, and
the words used are very carefully chosen, so that the meaning is
clear. The article is not a promise of mutual protection, but it is
a promise that in the case of an attack upon the citizens of either
nation, the other nation will not retaliate by attacking the
citizens of the other nation in the same place. It is not a
protection, but a declaration that the two nations will not attack
each other's citizens. It is an agreement to be peaceful, and to
avoid hostilities. The article is not in the nature of a treaty of
alliance, but it is a treaty of mutual non-aggression, with the
exception of the case of attack upon their citizens. 

The next article is as follows:

     ARTICLE II. The United States agree to continue to observe the
     provisions of the treaty of peace and friendship, made in
     1858, between the United States and the Emperor of China, and
     also the provisions of the treaty of commerce and navigation
     made in 1858, and the articles of",430,500,319,0.2669,0.3445,0.9744,0.9676,0.777,0.6169,-9.7,-16.6667,0.4163,0.3976,0.0622,0.1078,0.0149,0.0289,0.5515,0.556,0.9767,0.9562,0.47890295358649787,0.4379432624113475,0.5260115606936416,7,7,0.9942,0.9419,0.10232558139534884,0.118,0.09090909090909091,0.8536,0.6433,29-05-2025
Mark_Twain,Fenimore Cooper's Literary Offences.txt,"FENIMORE COOPER'S LITERARY OFFENCES

by Mark Twain



          The Pathfinder and The Deerslayer stand at the head of Cooper's
          novels as artistic creations. There are others of his works
          which contain parts as perfect as are to be found in these, and
          scenes even more thrilling. Not one can be compared with
          either of them as a finished whole. The defects in both of these tales are comparatively slight. They were pure works of art.--Prof. Lounsbury. The five tales reveal an extraordinary fulness of invention. ... One of the very greatest characters in fiction, Natty
          Bumppo.... The craft of the woodsman, the tricks of the trapper, all the
          delicate art of the forest, were familiar to Cooper from his
          youth up.--Prof. Brander Matthews. Cooper is the greatest artist in the domain of romantic fiction
          yet produced by America.--Wilkie Collins. It seems to me that it was far from right for the Professor of English
Literature in Yale, the Professor of English Literature in Columbia, and
Wilkie Collins to deliver opinions on Cooper's literature without having
read some of it. It would have been much more decorous to keep silent
and let persons talk who have read Cooper. Cooper's art has some defects. In one place in 'Deerslayer,' and in the
restricted space of two-thirds of a page, Cooper has scored 114 offences
against literary art out of a possible 115. It breaks the record. There are nineteen rules governing literary art in the domain of
romantic fiction--some say twenty-two. In Deerslayer Cooper violated
eighteen of them. These eighteen require:

1. That a tale shall accomplish something and arrive somewhere. But the
Deerslayer tale accomplishes nothing and arrives in the air. 2. They require that the episodes of a tale shall be necessary parts of
the tale, and shall help to develop it. But as the Deerslayer tale is
not a tale, and accomplishes nothing and arrives nowhere, the episodes
have no rightful place in the work, since there was nothing for them to
develop. 3. They require that the personages in a tale shall be alive, except in
the case of corpses, and that always the reader shall be able to tell
the corpses from the others. But this detail has often been overlooked
in the Deerslayer tale. 4. They require that the personages in a tale, both dead and alive,
shall exhibit a sufficient excuse for being there. But this detail also
has been overlooked in the Deerslayer tale. 5. They require that when the personages of a tale deal in conversation,
the talk shall sound like human talk, and be talk such as human
beings would be likely to talk in the given circumstances, and have
a discoverable meaning, also a discoverable purpose, and a show of
relevancy, and remain in the neighborhood of the subject in hand, and
be interesting to the reader, and help out the tale, and stop when the
people cannot think of anything more to say.","ut the tale, and stop when the people cannot think of anything more to say. But this requirement has been ignored from the beginning of the Deerslayer tale to the end of it. 6. They require that when the author describes the character of a personage in his tale, the conduct and conversation of that personage shall justify said description. But this law gets little or no attention in the Deerslayer tale, as Natty Bumppo's case will amply prove. 7. They require that when a personage talks like an illustrated, gilt-edged, tree-calf, hand-tooled, seven-dollar Friendship's Offering in the beginning of a paragraph, he shall not talk like a negro minstrel in the end of it. But this rule is flung down and danced upon in the Deerslayer tale. 8. They require that crass stupidities shall not be played upon the reader as “the craft of the woodsman, the delicate art of the forest,” by either the author or the people in the tale. But this rule is persistently violated in the Deerslayer tale. 9. They require that the personages of a tale shall confine themselves to possibilities and let miracles alone; or, if they venture a miracle, the author must so plausibly set it forth as to make it look possible and reasonable. But these rules are not respected in the Deerslayer tale. 10. They require that the author shall make the reader feel a deep interest in the personages of his tale and in their fate; and that he shall make the reader love the good people in the tale and hate the bad ones. But the reader of the Deerslayer tale dislikes the good people in it, is indifferent to the others, and wishes they would all get drowned together. 11. They require that the characters in a tale shall be so clearly defined that the reader can tell beforehand what each will do in a given emergency. But in the Deerslayer tale this rule is vacated. In addition to these large rules there are some little ones. These require that the author shall: 12. Say what he is proposing to say, not merely come near it. 13. Use the right word, not its second cousin. 14. Eschew surplusage. 15. Not omit necessary details. 16. Avoid slovenliness of form. 17. Use good grammar. 18. Employ a simple and straightforward style. Even these seven are coldly and persistently violated in the Deerslayer tale. Cooper's gift in the way of invention was not a rich endowment; but such as it was he liked to work it, he was pleased with the effects, and indeed he did some quite sweet things with it. In his little box of stage properties he kept six or eight cunning devices, tricks, artifices for his savages and woodsmen to deceive and circumvent each other with, and he was never so happy as when he was working these innocent things and seeing them go. A favorite one was to make a moccasined person tread in the","But this has been
overlooked in the Deerslayer tale. 6. They require that the personages in a tale shall not talk with the
voice of a writer. But this has been overlooked in the Deerslayer
tale. 7. They require that the personages in a tale shall not be so
unusual in their manner of speech as to be unrecognizable to the
reader. But this has been overlooked in the The Pathfinder tale. 8. They require that the personages in a tale shall not be so
unusual in their manner of speech as to be unrecognizable to the
reader. But this has been overlooked in the The Deerslayer tale. 9. They require that the personages in a tale shall not be so
unusual in their manner of speech as to be unrecognizable to the
reader. But this has been overlooked in the The Deerslayer tale. 10. They require that the personages in a tale shall not be so

THE ADVENTURES OF TOM SAWYer

CHAPTER I

Y-o-u-u Tom—Aunt Polly Decides Upon her Duty—Tom Practices Music—The
Challenge—A Private Entrance

The day was a hot one, and the sun was a blazing sun. The air was so
still and so heavy that it was like a weight on the back. The people were
all in the habit of going to church, and they were all in the habit of
being late. The streets were full of people, and the sidewalks were
crowded, but the sidewalks were not so crowded as the church. The church
was not so crowded as the people’s minds. The people’s minds were
filled with the question, “What will Tom Sawyer do to-day?”

Tom was in a state of high spirits, and he was ready to do anything.
He had a plan in his mind, and he was not going to let anything stop
him. He was not going to be kept in the house. He was not going to be
kept from going",407,500,274,0.1935,0.2351,0.9558,0.8575,0.1542,0.6998,73.1579,5.7246,0.2721,0.2812,0.0544,0.0884,0.0021,0.0419,0.6343,0.6677,0.9291,0.8434,0.21325051759834368,0.32065217391304346,0.4716981132075472,7,6,0.5558,0.8259,0.11547911547911548,0.028,0.11678832116788321,0.9215,0.6966,29-05-2025

Monday


This new creature with the long hair is a good deal in the way. It is
always hanging around and following me about. I don’t like this; I am
not used to company. I wish it would stay with the other animals. Cloudy to-day, wind in the east; think we shall have rain…. Where did I
get that word?… I remember now—the new creature uses it. Tuesday


Been examining the great waterfall. It is the finest thing on the
estate, I think. The new creature calls it Niagara Falls—why, I am sure
I do not know. Says it looks like Niagara Falls. That is not a reason;
it is mere waywardness and imbecility. I get no chance to name anything
myself. The new creature names everything that comes along, before I
can get in a protest. And always that same pretext is offered—it looks
like the thing. There is the dodo, for instance. Says the moment one
looks at it one sees at a glance that it “looks like a dodo.” It will
have to keep that name, no doubt. It wearies me to fret about it, and
it does no good, anyway. Dodo! It looks no more like a dodo than I do. Wednesday


Built me a shelter against the rain, but could not have it to myself in
peace. The new creature intruded. When I tried to put it out it shed
water out of the holes it looks with, and wiped it away with the back
of its paws, and made a noise such as some of the other animals make
when they are in distress. I wish it would not talk; it is always
talking. That sounds like a cheap fling at the poor creature, a slur;
but I do not mean it so. I have never heard the human voice before, and
any new and strange sound intruding itself here upon the solemn hush of
these dreaming solitudes offends my ear and seems a false note. And
this new sound is so close to me; it is right at my shoulder, right at
my ear, first on one side and then on the other, and I am used only to
sounds that are more or less distant from me. Friday


The naming goes recklessly on, in spite of anything I can do. I had a
very good name for the estate, and it was musical and pretty
—GARDEN-OF-EDEN. Privately, I continue to call it that, but not any
longer publicly.","er publicly. The new creature says it is all woods and rocks and scenery, and therefore has no resemblance to a garden. Says it looks like a park, and does not look like anything but a park. Consequently, without consulting me, it has been new-named —NIAGARA FALLS PARK. This is sufficiently high-handed, it seems to me. And already there is a sign up: KEEP OFF THE GRASS My life is not as happy as it was. Saturday The new creature eats too much fruit. We are going to run short, most likely. “We” again—that is its word; mine too, now, from hearing it so much. Good deal of fog this morning. I do not go out in the fog myself. The new creature does. It goes out in all weathers, and stumps right in with its muddy feet. And talks. It used to be so pleasant and quiet here. Sunday Pulled through. This day is getting to be more and more trying. It was selected and set apart last November as a day of rest. I already had six of them per week, before. This morning found the new creature trying to clod apples out of that forbidden tree. Monday The new creature says its name is Eve. That is all right, I have no objections. Says it is to call it by when I want it to come. I said it was superfluous, then. The word evidently raised me in its respect; and indeed it is a large, good word, and will bear repetition. It says it is not an It, it is a She. This is probably doubtful; yet it is all one to me; what she is were nothing to me if she would but go by herself and not talk. Tuesday She has littered the whole estate with execrable names and offensive signs: THIS WAY TO THE WHIRLPOOL. THIS WAY TO GOAT ISLAND. CAVE OF THE WINDS THIS WAY. She says this park would make a tidy summer resort, if there was any custom for it. Summer resort—another invention of hers—just words, without any meaning. What is a summer resort? But it is best not to ask her, she has such a rage for explaining. Friday She has taken to beseeching me to stop going over the Falls. What harm does it do? Says it makes her shudder. I wonder why. I have always done it—always liked the plunge, and the excitement, and the coolness. I supposed it was what the Falls were for. They have no other use that I can see, and they must have been made for something. She says they were only made for scenery—like the rhinoceros and the mastodon. I went over the Falls in a barrel—not satisfactory to her. Went over in a tub—still not satisfactory. Swam the Whirlpool and the Rapids in a fig-leaf suit. It got much damaged. Hence, tedious complaints about my extravagance. I am too much hampered here. What I need is change of scene. Saturday","The new creature, which is so unwise as to call
everything that is near it by the name of man, has taken it over, and
has turned it into GARDEN-OF-EDEN. I have no right to call it that
any longer, for it is not a garden, but a garden of Eden. That is the
word the new creature used. I have no right to call it that, for it is
not a garden, but a garden of Eden. I suppose the new creature is

because it is a garden where Eden is. It is a very odd reasoning, but
I do not know what else to do. The new creature has made all the
names, and it is not even a garden of Eden, but a garden of Eden. I
have no idea what it means, but it is a very long name. I do not like
long names. I think they are hard to remember. Saturday

am not at all sociable, and I have no time for it. I have no time for

INTRODUCTION


These speeches will address themselves to the minds and hearts of those
who read them, but not with the effect they had with those who heard
them; Clemens himself would have said, not with half the effect. I have
noted elsewhere how he always held that the actor doubled the value of
the author's words; and he was a great actor as well as a great author. He was a most consummate actor, with this difference from other actors,
that he was the first to know the thoughts and invent the fancies to
which his voice and action gave the color of life. Representation is the
art of other actors; his art was creative as well as representative; it
was nothing at second hand. I never heard Clemens speak when I thought he quite failed; some burst
or spurt redeemed him when he seemed flagging short of the goal, and,
whoever else was in the running, he came in ahead.","d. His near-failures were the error of a rare trust to the spontaneity in which other speakers confide, or are believed to confide, when they are on their feet. He knew that from the beginning of oratory the orator's spontaneity was for the silence and solitude of the closet where he mused his words to an imagined audience; that this was the use of orators from Demosthenes and Cicero up and down. He studied every word and syllable, and memorized them by a system of mnemonics peculiar to himself, consisting of an arbitrary arrangement of things on a table—knives, forks, salt-cellars; inkstands, pens, boxes, or whatever was at hand—which stood for points and clauses and climaxes, and were at once indelible diction and constant suggestion. He studied every tone and every gesture, and he forecast the result with the real audience from its result with that imagined audience. Therefore, it was beautiful to see him and to hear him; he rejoiced in the pleasure he gave and the blows of surprise which he dealt; and because he had his end in mind, he knew when to stop. I have been talking of his method and manner; the matter the reader has here before him; and it is good matter, glad, honest, kind, just. W. D. HOWELLS. PREFACE FROM THE PREFACE TO THE ENGLISH EDITION OF “MARK TWAIN'S SKETCHES” If I were to sell the reader a barrel of molasses, and he, instead of sweetening his substantial dinner with the same at judicious intervals, should eat the entire barrel at one sitting, and then abuse me for making him sick, I would say that he deserved to be made sick for not knowing any better how to utilize the blessings this world affords. And if I sell to the reader this volume of nonsense, and he, instead of seasoning his graver reading with a chapter of it now and then, when his mind demands such relaxation, unwisely overdoses himself with several chapters of it at a single sitting, he will deserve to be nauseated, and he will have nobody to blame but himself if he is. There is no more sin in publishing an entire volume of nonsense than there is in keeping a candy-store with no hardware in it. It lies wholly with the customer whether he will injure himself by means of either, or will derive from them the benefits which they will afford him if he uses their possibilities judiciously. Respectfully submitted, THE AUTHOR. MARK TWAIN'S SPEECHES THE STORY OF A SPEECH An address delivered in 1877, and a review of it twenty-nine years later. The original speech was delivered at a dinner given by the publishers of The Atlantic Monthly in honor of the seventieth anniversary o f the birth of John Greenleaf Whittier, at the Hotel Brunswick, Boston, December 17, 1877. This is an occasion peculiarly meet for the digging up of pleasant reminiscences concerning literary folk; therefore I will drop lightly into history myself. Standing","The speeches here
collected are not necessarily the best, but they are all of them the work

delivered in the United States, and some in Europe. Some are
delivered at the time of a great event, and some at a more

Paul Graham,A Student's Guide to Startups.txt,"Want to start a startup? Get funded by
Y Combinator. October 2006
(This essay is derived from a talk at MIT.)
Till recently graduating seniors had two choices: get a job or go
to grad school. I think there will increasingly be a third option:
to start your own startup. But how common will that be? I'm sure the default will always be to get a job, but starting a
startup could well become as popular as grad school. In the late
90s my professor friends used to complain that they couldn't get
grad students, because all the undergrads were going to work for
startups. I wouldn't be surprised if that situation returns, but
with one difference: this time they'll be starting their own
instead of going to work for other people's. The most ambitious students will at this point be asking: Why wait
till you graduate? Why not start a startup while you're in college? In fact, why go to college at all? Why not start a startup instead? A year and a half ago I gave a talk
where I said that the average age of the founders of
Yahoo, Google, and Microsoft was 24, and that if grad students could
start startups, why not undergrads? I'm glad I phrased that as a
question, because now I can pretend it wasn't merely a rhetorical
one. At the time I couldn't imagine why there should be any lower
limit for the age of startup founders. Graduation is a bureaucratic
change, not a biological one. And certainly there are undergrads
as competent technically as most grad students. So why shouldn't
undergrads be able to start startups as well as grad students? I now realize that something does change at graduation: you lose a
huge excuse for failing. Regardless of how complex your life is,
you'll find that everyone else, including your family and friends,
will discard all the low bits and regard you as having a single
occupation at any given time. If you're in college and have a
summer job writing software, you still read as a student. Whereas
if you graduate and get a job programming, you'll be instantly
regarded by everyone as a programmer. The problem with starting a startup while you're still in school
is that there's a built-in escape hatch. If you start a startup
in the summer between your junior and senior year, it reads to
everyone as a summer job. So if it goes nowhere, big deal; you return to school in the
fall with all the other seniors; no one regards you as a failure,
because your occupation is student, and you didn't fail at that. Whereas if you start a startup just one year later, after you
graduate, as long as you're not accepted to grad school in the fall
the startup reads to everyone as your occupation. You're
now a startup founder, so you have to do well at that.","For nearly everyone, the opinion of one's peers is the most powerful motivator of all—more powerful even than the nominal goal of most startup founders, getting rich. [1] About a month into each funding cycle we have an event called Prototype Day where each startup presents to the others what they've got so far. You might think they wouldn't need any more motivation. They're working on their cool new idea; they have funding for the immediate future; and they're playing a game with only two outcomes: wealth or failure. You'd think that would be motivation enough. And yet the prospect of a demo pushes most of them into a rush of activity. Even if you start a startup explicitly to get rich, the money you might get seems pretty theoretical most of the time. What drives you day to day is not wanting to look bad. You probably can't change that. Even if you could, I don't think you'd want to; someone who really, truly doesn't care what his peers think of him is probably a psychopath. So the best you can do is consider this force like a wind, and set up your boat accordingly. If you know your peers are going to push you in some direction, choose good peers, and position yourself so they push you in a direction you like. Graduation changes the prevailing winds, and those make a difference. Starting a startup is so hard that it's a close call even for the ones that succeed. However high a startup may be flying now, it probably has a few leaves stuck in the landing gear from those trees it barely cleared at the end of the runway. In such a close game, the smallest increase in the forces against you can be enough to flick you over the edge into failure. When we first started Y Combinator we encouraged people to start startups while they were still in college. That's partly because Y Combinator began as a kind of summer program. We've kept the program shape—all of us having dinner together once a week turns out to be a good idea—but we've decided now that the party line should be to tell people to wait till they graduate. Does that mean you can't start a startup in college? Not at all. Sam Altman, the co-founder of Loopt, had just finished his sophomore year when we funded them, and Loopt is probably the most promising of all the startups we've funded so far. But Sam Altman is a very unusual guy. Within about three minutes of meeting him, I remember thinking ""Ah, so this is what Bill Gates must have been like when he was 19."" If it can work to start a startup during college, why do we tell people not to? For the same reason that the probably apocryphal violinist, whenever he was asked to judge someone's playing, would always say they didn't have enough talent to make it as a pro. Succeeding as","If you fail, you're a failure. There's no escape. So this is a big reason why people are hesitant to start
startups while they're in college. But the problem is not only that. The other problem is that if you're in college, you're not
yet an adult. You're not in a position to make big decisions. You're still
dependent on your parents, and you're not yet responsible for
your own finances. So even if you could start a startup, you might not be able
to afford to. So there are two reasons that people don't start a startup in
college: one is that it's not seen as a serious endeavor, and the
other is that they can't afford to. But what if we could make it both serious and affordable? What if we could
give students a grant, and give them a chance to build a
startup? That would make it more serious and more affordable. In fact, that's exactly what we've been doing for the past year
and a half at Y Combinator. We've been giving students a grant of about $30,000 to build a
startup. So the first thing we do is we give them a grant. Then we help them build a startup. We help them find people to work with, we help them find
funding, we help them build a website, we help them with the
legal stuff. And the result is that they're able to build a startup with
a real chance of success. The idea is that we're not just giving them money, but we're also giving
them a mentorship. We're giving them a group of people who will help them
build the startup. And then, once they've built the startup, we help them get
funded. So we take them from idea to funded startup in 3 months. That's the idea. We started the program in the",490,500,313,0.2409,0.2655,0.9788,0.9117,0.9403,0.7656,1.1548,-4.2619,0.3609,0.3723,0.0519,0.0781,0.0068,0.0168,0.4858,0.731,0.9733,0.957,0.4585537918871252,0.4553415061295972,0.5067385444743935,5,6,0.9686,0.9563,0.15918367346938775,0.144,0.1853035143769968,0.8126,0.7596,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,Java's Cover.txt,"April 2001
This essay developed out of conversations I've had with
several other programmers about why Java smelled suspicious. It's not
a critique of Java! It is a case study of hacker's radar. Over time, hackers develop a nose for good (and bad) technology. I thought it might be interesting to try and write down what
made Java seem suspect to me. Some people who've read this think it's an interesting attempt to write about
something that hasn't been written about before. Others say I
will get in trouble for appearing to be writing about
things I don't understand. So, just in
case it does any good, let me clarify that I'm not writing here
about Java (which I have never used) but about hacker's radar
(which I have thought about a lot). The aphorism ""you can't tell a book by its cover"" originated in
the times when books were sold in plain cardboard covers, to be
bound by each purchaser according to his own taste. In those days,
you couldn't tell a book by its cover. But publishing has advanced
since then: present-day publishers work hard to make the cover
something you can tell a book by. I spend a lot of time in bookshops and I feel as if I have by now
learned to understand everything publishers mean to tell me about
a book, and perhaps a bit more. The time I haven't spent in
bookshops I've spent mostly in front of computers, and I feel as
if I've learned, to some degree, to judge technology by its cover
as well. It may be just luck, but I've saved myself from a few
technologies that turned out to be real stinkers. So far, Java seems like a stinker to me. I've never written a Java
program, never more than glanced over reference books about it,
but I have a hunch that it won't be a very successful language. I may turn out to be mistaken; making predictions about technology
is a dangerous business. But for what it's worth, as a sort of
time capsule, here's why I don't like the look of Java:
1. It has been so energetically hyped. Real standards don't have
to be promoted. No one had to promote C, or Unix, or HTML. A real
standard tends to be already established by the time most people
hear about it. On the hacker radar screen, Perl is as big as Java,
or bigger, just on the strength of its own merits. 2. It's aimed low. In the original Java white paper, Gosling
explicitly says Java was designed not to be too difficult for
programmers used to C. It was designed to be another C++: C plus
a few ideas taken from more advanced languages. Like the creators
of sitcoms or junk food or package tours, Java's designers were
consciously designing a product for people not as smart as them.","Historically, languages designed for other people to use have been bad: Cobol, PL/I, Pascal, Ada, C++. The good languages have been those that were designed for their own creators: C, Perl, Smalltalk, Lisp. 3. It has ulterior motives. Someone once said that the world would be a better place if people only wrote books because they had something to say, rather than because they wanted to write a book. Likewise, the reason we hear about Java all the time is not because it has something to say about programming languages. We hear about Java as part of a plan by Sun to undermine Microsoft. 4. No one loves it. C, Perl, Python, Smalltalk, and Lisp programmers love their languages. I've never heard anyone say that they loved Java. 5. People are forced to use it. A lot of the people I know using Java are using it because they feel they have to. Either it's something they felt they had to do to get funded, or something they thought customers would want, or something they were told to do by management. These are smart people; if the technology was good, they'd have used it voluntarily. 6. It has too many cooks. The best programming languages have been developed by small groups. Java seems to be run by a committee. If it turns out to be a good language, it will be the first time in history that a committee has designed a good language. 7. It's bureaucratic. From what little I know about Java, there seem to be a lot of protocols for doing things. Really good languages aren't like that. They let you do what you want and get out of the way. 8. It's pseudo-hip. Sun now pretends that Java is a grassroots, open-source language effort like Perl or Python. This one just happens to be controlled by a giant company. So the language is likely to have the same drab clunkiness as anything else that comes out of a big company. 9. It's designed for large organizations. Large organizations have different aims from hackers. They want languages that are (believed to be) suitable for use by large teams of mediocre programmers-- languages with features that, like the speed limiters in U-Haul trucks, prevent fools from doing too much damage. Hackers don't like a language that talks down to them. Hackers just want power. Historically, languages designed for large organizations (PL/I, Ada) have lost, while hacker languages (C, Perl) have won. The reason: today's teenage hacker is tomorrow's CTO. 10. The wrong people like it. The programmers I admire most are not, on the whole, captivated by Java. Who does like Java? Suits, who don't know one language from another, but know that they keep hearing about Java in the press; programmers at big companies, who are amazed to find that there is something even better than C++; and plug-and-chug undergrads, who are ready to like anything that might get them a job (will this be on the","The idea is that the language would be easy to learn and use, and
that people would not have to worry about low-level details. This
is a very clever idea. But when the designers have to think about what's
""simple"" for the target audience, they are not thinking about what's
simple for the hacker. Hackers are not the target audience. Hackers are not the target audience for Java. They are not
the target audience for any of the other ""simple"" languages like
Basic, Pascal, or even C++. The target audience for Java is
people who are not hackers. 3. Java is a complete language. The design philosophy is that
Java should be able to do everything. It is designed to be
a complete language, which is the opposite of the Unix
philosophy. The Unix philosophy is that programs should do one
thing, do it well, and do it simply. Java's design philosophy is that it should do everything. This is
the opposite of the Unix philosophy, and that's a big red flag
for me. It's a very different way of thinking. In Unix, the system is made up of many small, simple
programs that are connected together. In Java, the system is made up of a single large, complex
language that is supposed to do everything. 4. Java has a large, complicated syntax. It has a lot of
keywords, a lot of punctuation, a lot of complicated
grammar. This is the opposite of the Unix philosophy of
simple, small, and clear. 4. Java has a large, complicated syntax. It has a lot of keywords, a lot of punctuation, a lot of complicated grammar. This is the opposite of the Unix philosophy of simple, small, and clear. 5. Java is not modular. The language is designed to be
self-contained. This is the opposite of the Unix
philosophy of small,",485,500,308,0.3483,0.196,0.9756,0.9183,0.6476,0.5975,-6.4058,-7.3165,0.4075,0.2852,0.038,0.023,0.0018,0.0022,0.4914,0.6231,0.9648,0.9162,0.455026455026455,0.40878378378378377,0.45879120879120877,5,5,0.932,0.9046,0.177319587628866,0.212,0.2012987012987013,0.966,0.544,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,A Version 1.0.txt,"October 2004
As E. B. White said, ""good writing is rewriting."" I didn't
realize this when I was in school. In writing, as in math and
science, they only show you the finished product. You don't see all the false starts. This gives students a
misleading view of how things get made. Part of the reason it happens is that writers don't want
people to see their mistakes. But I'm willing to let people
see an early draft if it will show how much you have
to rewrite to beat an essay into shape. Below is the oldest version I can find of
The Age of the Essay
(probably the second or third day), with
text that ultimately survived in
red and text that later
got deleted in gray. There seem to be several categories of cuts: things I got wrong,
things that seem like bragging, flames,
digressions, stretches of awkward prose, and unnecessary words. I discarded more from the beginning. That's
not surprising; it takes a while to hit your stride. There
are more digressions at the start, because I'm not sure where
I'm heading. The amount of cutting is about average. I probably write
three to four words for every one that appears in the final
version of an essay. (Before anyone gets mad at me for opinions expressed here, remember
that anything you see here that's not in the final version is obviously
something I chose not to publish, often because I disagree
with it.)
Recently a friend said that what he liked about
my essays was that they weren't written the way
we'd been taught to write essays in school. You
remember: topic sentence, introductory paragraph,
supporting paragraphs, conclusion. It hadn't
occurred to me till then that those horrible things
we had to write in school were even connected to
what I was doing now. But sure enough, I thought,
they did call them ""essays,"" didn't they? Well, they're not. Those things you have to write
in school are not only not essays, they're one of the
most pointless of all the pointless hoops you have
to jump through in school. And I worry that they
not only teach students the wrong things about writing,
but put them off writing entirely. So I'm going to give the other side of the story: what
an essay really is, and how you write one. Or at least,
how I write one. Students be forewarned: if you actually write
the kind of essay I describe, you'll probably get bad
grades. But knowing how it's really done should
at least help you to understand the feeling of futility
you have when you're writing the things they tell you to. The most obvious difference between real essays and
the things one has to write in school is that real
essays are not exclusively about English literature. It's a fine thing for schools to
teach students how to
write.","But for some bizarre reason (actually, a very specific bizarre reason that I'll explain in a moment), the teaching of writing has gotten mixed together with the study of literature. And so all over the country, students are writing not about how a baseball team with a small budget might compete with the Yankees, or the role of color in fashion, or what constitutes a good dessert, but about symbolism in Dickens. With obvious results. Only a few people really care about symbolism in Dickens. The teacher doesn't. The students don't. Most of the people who've had to write PhD disserations about Dickens don't. And certainly Dickens himself would be more interested in an essay about color or baseball. How did things get this way? To answer that we have to go back almost a thousand years. Between about 500 and 1000, life was not very good in Europe. The term ""dark ages"" is presently out of fashion as too judgemental (the period wasn't dark; it was just different), but if this label didn't already exist, it would seem an inspired metaphor. What little original thought there was took place in lulls between constant wars and had something of the character of the thoughts of parents with a new baby. The most amusing thing written during this period, Liudprand of Cremona's Embassy to Constantinople, is, I suspect, mostly inadvertantly so. Around 1000 Europe began to catch its breath. And once they had the luxury of curiosity, one of the first things they discovered was what we call ""the classics."" Imagine if we were visited by aliens. If they could even get here they'd presumably know a few things we don't. Immediately Alien Studies would become the most dynamic field of scholarship: instead of painstakingly discovering things for ourselves, we could simply suck up everything they'd discovered. So it was in Europe in 1200. When classical texts began to circulate in Europe, they contained not just new answers, but new questions. (If anyone proved a theorem in christian Europe before 1200, for example, there is no record of it.) For a couple centuries, some of the most important work being done was intellectual archaelogy. Those were also the centuries during which schools were first established. And since reading ancient texts was the essence of what scholars did then, it became the basis of the curriculum. By 1700, someone who wanted to learn about physics didn't need to start by mastering Greek in order to read Aristotle. But schools change slower than scholarship: the study of ancient texts had such prestige that it remained the backbone of education until the late 19th century. By then it was merely a tradition. It did serve some purposes: reading a foreign language was difficult, and thus taught discipline, or at least, kept students busy; it introduced students to cultures quite different from their own; and its very uselessness made it function (like white gloves) as a social bulwark. But it certainly wasn't true, and hadn't","But it's even finer if they teach students how to
think. And essays, as a genre, are an excellent
medium for teaching students how to think. So, in the next few paragraphs, I'm going to talk
about how to write an essay, as I do it, in the way
that I think is best for students. I don't know if that's the best way, but I think it's
the way that works best for me. So let's start with the first question: what is an essay? The answer is: an essay is a piece of writing that is not a
formal, structured, or argumentative piece of writing. It's more like a
piece of writing that is a
personal, spontaneous, and
unstructured piece of writing. That is, it's a
piece of writing that is not
about the ""what,"" but about the ""why."" The essay is not about what you
think, but about how you
think. It is not about what you say, but about
how you say it. That's why I call it a ""self-expression
piece of writing."" In other words, an essay is not
about the content, but about the process. That's the key. It is not about the content, but about the process. So that's the first thing to understand. If you are writing an essay, you're not
trying to produce a finished
product. You're trying to produce a
process. So you're not trying to make a
good argument, but you're trying to make a
good process. The essay is not about the result, but about the
way you get to the result. So, if I were to write an essay about the
importance of the essay, I wouldn't be
trying to argue that essays are important. I would be trying to show how I
think about essays. I wouldn't be trying to",487,500,304,0.1571,0.2101,0.9648,0.9283,0.9844,0.8678,0.2667,-2.2303,0.3511,0.416,0.0276,0.0514,0.0042,0.0075,0.3826,0.5384,0.9637,0.9768,0.4553415061295972,0.4334470989761092,0.5201072386058981,4,6,0.9896,0.9815,0.17659137577002054,0.174,0.23026315789473684,0.8318,0.531,29-05-2025

(This article explains why much of the next generation of software
may be server-based, what that will mean for programmers,
and why this new kind of software is a great opportunity for startups. It's derived from a talk at BBN Labs.)
In the summer of 1995, my friend Robert Morris and I decided to
start a startup. The PR campaign leading up to Netscape's IPO was
running full blast then, and there was a lot of talk in the press
about online commerce. At the time there might have been thirty
actual stores on the Web, all made by hand. If there were going
to be a lot of online stores, there would need to be software for making
them, so we decided to write some. For the first week or so we intended to make this an ordinary
desktop application. Then one day we had the idea of making the
software run on our Web server, using the browser as an
interface. We tried rewriting the software to work over
the Web, and it was clear that this was the way to go. If we wrote our software to run on the server, it would be a lot easier
for the users and for us as well. This turned out to be a good plan. Now, as
Yahoo Store, this
software is the most popular online store builder, with
about 14,000 users. When we started Viaweb, hardly anyone understood what we meant when
we said that the software ran on the server. It was not until
Hotmail was launched a year later that people started to get it. Now everyone knows that this is a valid approach. There is
a name now for what we were: an Application Service Provider,
or ASP. I think that a lot of the next generation of software will be
written on this model. Even Microsoft, who have the most to
lose, seem to see the inevitablity of moving some things off
the desktop. If software moves
off the desktop and onto servers, it will mean a very different
world for developers. This article describes the surprising
things we saw, as some of the first visitors to this new world. To the extent software does move onto
servers, what I'm describing here is the future. The Next Thing? When we look back on the desktop software era, I think we'll marvel
at the inconveniences people put up with, just as we marvel now at
what early car owners put up with. For the first twenty or thirty
years, you had to be a car expert to own a car. But cars were such
a big win that lots of people who weren't car experts wanted to
have them as well. Computers are in this phase now. When you own a desktop computer,
you end up learning a lot more than you wanted to know about what's
happening inside it. But more than half the households in the US
own one.","My mother has a computer that she uses for email and for keeping accounts. About a year ago she was alarmed to receive a letter from Apple, offering her a discount on a new version of the operating system. There's something wrong when a sixty-five year old woman who wants to use a computer for email and accounts has to think about installing new operating systems. Ordinary users shouldn't even know the words ""operating system,"" much less ""device driver"" or ""patch."" There is now another way to deliver software that will save users from becoming system administrators. Web-based applications are programs that run on Web servers and use Web pages as the user interface. For the average user this new kind of software will be easier, cheaper, more mobile, more reliable, and often more powerful than desktop software. With Web-based software, most users won't have to think about anything except the applications they use. All the messy, changing stuff will be sitting on a server somewhere, maintained by the kind of people who are good at that kind of thing. And so you won't ordinarily need a computer, per se, to use software. All you'll need will be something with a keyboard, a screen, and a Web browser. Maybe it will have wireless Internet access. Maybe it will also be your cell phone. Whatever it is, it will be consumer electronics: something that costs about $200, and that people choose mostly based on how the case looks. You'll pay more for Internet services than you do for the hardware, just as you do now with telephones. [1] It will take about a tenth of a second for a click to get to the server and back, so users of heavily interactive software, like Photoshop, will still want to have the computations happening on the desktop. But if you look at the kind of things most people use computers for, a tenth of a second latency would not be a problem. My mother doesn't really need a desktop computer, and there are a lot of people like her. The Win for Users Near my house there is a car with a bumper sticker that reads ""death before inconvenience."" Most people, most of the time, will take whatever choice requires least work. If Web-based software wins, it will be because it's more convenient. And it looks as if it will be, for users and developers both. To use a purely Web-based application, all you need is a browser connected to the Internet. So you can use a Web-based application anywhere. When you install software on your desktop computer, you can only use it on that computer. Worse still, your files are trapped on that computer. The inconvenience of this model becomes more and more evident as people get used to networks. The thin end of the wedge here was Web-based email. Millions of people now realize that you should have access to email messages no matter where you are. And if you","Now, for the next generation of software, I think the
most important change will be the move from desktop to server.
In this new world, the software is not on the user's machine. It is on a
server, and the user accesses it through a browser. The user is not
an end user. The user is an application user. For example, the user might be a business owner who wants to
run a company and manage it. They might be a developer who
wants to build a Web application, or a designer who wants to create a

Paul Graham,Be Good.txt,"April 2008
(This essay is derived from a talk at the 2008 Startup School.)
About a month after we started Y Combinator we came up with the
phrase that became our motto: Make something people want. We've
learned a lot since then, but if I were choosing now that's still
the one I'd pick. Another thing we tell founders is not to worry too much about the
business model, at least at first. Not because making money is
unimportant, but because it's so much easier than building something
great. A couple weeks ago I realized that if you put those two ideas
together, you get something surprising. Make something people want. Don't worry too much about making money. What you've got is a
description of a charity. When you get an unexpected result like this, it could either be a
bug or a new discovery. Either businesses aren't supposed to be
like charities, and we've proven by reductio ad absurdum that one
or both of the principles we began with is false. Or we have a new
idea. I suspect it's the latter, because as soon as this thought occurred
to me, a whole bunch of other things fell into place. Examples
For example, Craigslist. It's not a charity, but they run it like
one. And they're astoundingly successful. When you scan down the
list of most popular web sites, the number of employees at Craigslist
looks like a misprint. Their revenues aren't as high as they could
be, but most startups would be happy to trade places with them. In Patrick O'Brian's novels, his captains always try to get upwind
of their opponents. If you're upwind, you decide when and if to
engage the other ship. Craigslist is effectively upwind of enormous
revenues. They'd face some challenges if they wanted to make more,
but not the sort you face when you're tacking upwind, trying to
force a crappy product on ambivalent users by spending ten times
as much on sales as on development. [1]
I'm not saying startups should aim to end up like Craigslist. They're a product of unusual circumstances. But they're a good
model for the early phases. Google looked a lot like a charity in the beginning. They didn't
have ads for over a year. At year 1, Google was indistinguishable
from a nonprofit. If a nonprofit or government organization had
started a project to index the web, Google at year 1 is the limit
of what they'd have produced. Back when I was working on spam filters I thought it would be a
good idea to have a web-based email service with good spam filtering. I wasn't thinking of it as a company. I just wanted to keep people
from getting spammed. But as I thought more about this project, I
realized it would probably have to be a company. It would cost
something to run, and it would be a pain to fund with grants and
donations. That was a surprising realization.","Companies often claim to be benevolent, but it was surprising to realize there were purely benevolent projects that had to be embodied as companies to work. I didn't want to start another company, so I didn't do it. But if someone had, they'd probably be quite rich now. There was a window of about two years when spam was increasing rapidly but all the big email services had terrible filters. If someone had launched a new, spam-free mail service, users would have flocked to it. Notice the pattern here? From either direction we get to the same spot. If you start from successful startups, you find they often behaved like nonprofits. And if you start from ideas for nonprofits, you find they'd often make good startups. Power How wide is this territory? Would all good nonprofits be good companies? Possibly not. What makes Google so valuable is that their users have money. If you make people with money love you, you can probably get some of it. But could you also base a successful startup on behaving like a nonprofit to people who don't have money? Could you, for example, grow a successful startup out of curing an unfashionable but deadly disease like malaria? I'm not sure, but I suspect that if you pushed this idea, you'd be surprised how far it would go. For example, people who apply to Y Combinator don't generally have much money, and yet we can profit by helping them, because with our help they could make money. Maybe the situation is similar with malaria. Maybe an organization that helped lift its weight off a country could benefit from the resulting growth. I'm not proposing this is a serious idea. I don't know anything about malaria. But I've been kicking ideas around long enough to know when I come across a powerful one. One way to guess how far an idea extends is to ask yourself at what point you'd bet against it. The thought of betting against benevolence is alarming in the same way as saying that something is technically impossible. You're just asking to be made a fool of, because these are such powerful forces. [2] For example, initially I thought maybe this principle only applied to Internet startups. Obviously it worked for Google, but what about Microsoft? Surely Microsoft isn't benevolent? But when I think back to the beginning, they were. Compared to IBM they were like Robin Hood. When IBM introduced the PC, they thought they were going to make money selling hardware at high prices. But by gaining control of the PC standard, Microsoft opened up the market to any manufacturer. Hardware prices plummeted, and lots of people got to have computers who couldn't otherwise have afforded them. It's the sort of thing you'd expect Google to do. Microsoft isn't so benevolent now. Now when one thinks of what Microsoft does to users, all the verbs that come to mind begin with F. [3] And yet it doesn't seem to","I was used to
thinking of nonprofits as being able to do what they want, but
this project was too expensive and too complex for that. So, the first thing I realized was that I needed to be a company. But
then I realized that if I'm going to be a company, I need to be a
company that's doing something people want. So I had to
build a product that people wanted. Then I had to
realize that if I'm going to be a company, I need to be a company that's
making money. [2]
So the idea that companies should be like charities, in that they should
focus on the product and not the money, is a good way to start, but
then you need to pivot to the idea that the company has to be making
money. But how do you get from the idea that you're making something
people want to the idea that you're making money? That's the key question. The answer is that the money is a side effect of the product. If you're making something people want, they'll pay for it.
But that's not how most people think about it. Most people think about the product as the means to an end, and the money
as the end. But in reality, the money is just the byproduct of the product.
The product is the end. The money is just the means to the end. [3]
So, when you're building a product, you should focus on the product, not the
money. But once you have the product, you can't ignore the money. Because
if you don't make money, you can't continue. So the challenge is to build something that people want, and then
make money from it. But if you don't have the product, you can't make money. So you need to build the product first, and then the money comes. But the money comes from the product",498,500,324,0.2752,0.2356,0.9731,0.9549,0.9175,0.965,-1.2301,0.5403,0.4241,0.4369,0.0323,0.0594,0.0021,0.0131,0.5625,0.5955,0.9761,0.9533,0.4396551724137931,0.43127147766323026,0.5274151436031331,9,6,0.9789,0.9811,0.1686746987951807,0.168,0.18209876543209877,0.9451,0.5304,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,You Weren't Meant to Have a Boss.txt,"Want to start a startup? Get funded by
Y Combinator. March 2008, rev. June 2008
Technology tends to separate normal from natural. Our bodies
weren't designed to eat the foods that people in rich countries eat, or
to get so little exercise. There may be a similar problem with the way we work:
a normal job may be as bad for us intellectually as white flour
or sugar is for us physically. I began to suspect this after spending several years working
with startup founders. I've now worked with over 200 of them, and I've
noticed a definite difference between programmers working on their
own startups and those working for large organizations. I wouldn't say founders seem happier, necessarily;
starting a startup can be very stressful. Maybe the best way to put
it is to say that they're happier in the sense that your body is
happier during a long run than sitting on a sofa eating
doughnuts. Though they're statistically abnormal, startup founders seem to be
working in a way that's more natural for humans. I was in Africa last year and saw a lot of animals in the wild that
I'd only seen in zoos before. It was remarkable how different they
seemed. Particularly lions. Lions in the wild seem about ten times
more alive. They're like different animals. I suspect that working
for oneself feels better to humans in much the same way that living
in the wild must feel better to a wide-ranging predator like a lion. Life in a zoo is easier, but it isn't the life they were designed
for. Trees
What's so unnatural about working for a big company? The root of
the problem is that humans weren't meant to work in such large
groups. Another thing you notice when you see animals in the wild is that
each species thrives in groups of a certain size. A herd of impalas
might have 100 adults; baboons maybe 20; lions rarely 10. Humans
also seem designed to work in groups, and what I've read about
hunter-gatherers accords with research on organizations and my own
experience to suggest roughly what the ideal size is: groups of 8
work well; by 20 they're getting hard to manage; and a group of 50
is really unwieldy. [1]
Whatever the upper limit is, we are clearly not meant to work in
groups of several hundred. And yet—for reasons having more
to do with technology than human nature—a great many people
work for companies with hundreds or thousands of employees. Companies know groups that large wouldn't work, so they divide
themselves into units small enough to work together. But to
coordinate these they have to introduce something new: bosses. These smaller groups are always arranged in a tree structure. Your
boss is the point where your group attaches to the tree. But when
you use this trick for dividing a large group into smaller ones,
something strange happens that I've never heard anyone mention
explicitly.","In the group one level up from yours, your boss represents your entire group. A group of 10 managers is not merely a group of 10 people working together in the usual way. It's really a group of groups. Which means for a group of 10 managers to work together as if they were simply a group of 10 individuals, the group working for each manager would have to work as if they were a single person—the workers and manager would each share only one person's worth of freedom between them. In practice a group of people are never able to act as if they were one person. But in a large organization divided into groups in this way, the pressure is always in that direction. Each group tries its best to work as if it were the small group of individuals that humans were designed to work in. That was the point of creating it. And when you propagate that constraint, the result is that each person gets freedom of action in inverse proportion to the size of the entire tree. [2] Anyone who's worked for a large organization has felt this. You can feel the difference between working for a company with 100 employees and one with 10,000, even if your group has only 10 people. Corn Syrup A group of 10 people within a large organization is a kind of fake tribe. The number of people you interact with is about right. But something is missing: individual initiative. Tribes of hunter-gatherers have much more freedom. The leaders have a little more power than other members of the tribe, but they don't generally tell them what to do and when the way a boss can. It's not your boss's fault. The real problem is that in the group above you in the hierarchy, your entire group is one virtual person. Your boss is just the way that constraint is imparted to you. So working in a group of 10 people within a large organization feels both right and wrong at the same time. On the surface it feels like the kind of group you're meant to work in, but something major is missing. A job at a big company is like high fructose corn syrup: it has some of the qualities of things you're meant to like, but is disastrously lacking in others. Indeed, food is an excellent metaphor to explain what's wrong with the usual sort of job. For example, working for a big company is the default thing to do, at least for programmers. How bad could it be? Well, food shows that pretty clearly. If you were dropped at a random point in America today, nearly all the food around you would be bad for you. Humans were not designed to eat white flour, refined sugar, high fructose corn syrup, and hydrogenated vegetable oil. And yet if you analyzed the contents of the average grocery store you'd probably find these four ingredients accounted for most","The tree structure, which is natural for small groups, becomes
unnatural when it's applied to large groups. And it's not just the
structure of the company that's unnatural. It's the
way we communicate. In organizations, people are
forced to communicate in a way that is unnatural for humans. We're
not designed to speak in a hierarchy of orders. We're not
designed to say, ""I need to ask my boss for approval before I can
do this."" That's not how we talk. We talk in a way that is more natural for a group that is
cooperative, not hierarchical. And this is the key point: when we work in
a company, we're not working in the way that is natural for humans.
We're working in a way that is unnatural. It's not that we're not smart enough to understand that, but
that we're not designed for it. We're not designed to work in a company.
[2]
When you start a startup, you're not trying to build a company. You're
trying to build something that's more like a group of people
working together. In a startup, you have fewer people, and they're
all in the same room. You don't have a boss. You don't have
a CEO. You don't have a structure. You just have a group of people
who are all working toward the same goal. It's not a hierarchy.
It's a network. [3]
In a company, the structure is a tree. In a startup, it's a
network. This is a crucial difference. In a company, you have to go through many layers of
authority to get something done. In a startup, you can just go
directly to the person who's in charge. [4]
In a company, the way we communicate is hierarchical. In a
startup, it's more like a conversation.",496,500,300,0.2767,0.3391,0.9492,0.8989,0.9723,0.6748,0.4897,-5.5929,0.4027,0.4007,0.0736,0.0745,0.0139,0.0135,0.2322,0.4086,0.9733,0.9605,0.40463458110516937,0.4543828264758497,0.49206349206349204,8,6,0.9469,0.9441,0.13709677419354838,0.122,0.26,0.8288,0.5585,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,Stuff.txt,"July 2007
I have too much stuff. Most people in America do. In fact, the
poorer people are, the more stuff they seem to have. Hardly anyone
is so poor that they can't afford a front yard full of old cars. It wasn't always this way. Stuff used to be rare and valuable. You can still see evidence of that if you look for it. For example,
in my house in Cambridge, which was built in 1876, the bedrooms
don't have closets. In those days people's stuff fit in a chest
of drawers. Even as recently as a few decades ago there was a lot
less stuff. When I look back at photos from the 1970s, I'm surprised
how empty houses look. As a kid I had what I thought was a huge
fleet of toy cars, but they'd be dwarfed by the number of toys my
nephews have. All together my Matchboxes and Corgis took up about
a third of the surface of my bed. In my nephews' rooms the bed is
the only clear space. Stuff has gotten a lot cheaper, but our attitudes toward it haven't
changed correspondingly. We overvalue stuff. That was a big problem
for me when I had no money. I felt poor, and stuff seemed valuable,
so almost instinctively I accumulated it. Friends would leave
something behind when they moved, or I'd see something as I was
walking down the street on trash night (beware of anything you find
yourself describing as ""perfectly good""), or I'd find something in
almost new condition for a tenth its retail price at a garage sale. And pow, more stuff. In fact these free or nearly free things weren't bargains, because
they were worth even less than they cost. Most of the stuff I
accumulated was worthless, because I didn't need it. What I didn't understand was that the value of some new acquisition
wasn't the difference between its retail price and what I paid for
it. It was the value I derived from it. Stuff is an extremely
illiquid asset. Unless you have some plan for selling that valuable
thing you got so cheaply, what difference does it make what it's
""worth?"" The only way you're ever going to extract any value from
it is to use it. And if you don't have any immediate use for it,
you probably never will. Companies that sell stuff have spent huge sums training us to think
stuff is still valuable. But it would be closer to the truth to
treat stuff as worthless. In fact, worse than worthless, because once you've accumulated a
certain amount of stuff, it starts to own you rather than the other
way around. I know of one couple who couldn't retire to the town
they preferred because they couldn't afford a place there big enough
for all their stuff. Their house isn't theirs; it's their stuff's. And unless you're extremely organized, a house full of stuff can
be very depressing.","A cluttered room saps one's spirits. One reason, obviously, is that there's less room for people in a room full of stuff. But there's more going on than that. I think humans constantly scan their environment to build a mental model of what's around them. And the harder a scene is to parse, the less energy you have left for conscious thoughts. A cluttered room is literally exhausting. (This could explain why clutter doesn't seem to bother kids as much as adults. Kids are less perceptive. They build a coarser model of their surroundings, and this consumes less energy.) I first realized the worthlessness of stuff when I lived in Italy for a year. All I took with me was one large backpack of stuff. The rest of my stuff I left in my landlady's attic back in the US. And you know what? All I missed were some of the books. By the end of the year I couldn't even remember what else I had stored in that attic. And yet when I got back I didn't discard so much as a box of it. Throw away a perfectly good rotary telephone? I might need that one day. The really painful thing to recall is not just that I accumulated all this useless stuff, but that I often spent money I desperately needed on stuff that I didn't. Why would I do that? Because the people whose job is to sell you stuff are really, really good at it. The average 25 year old is no match for companies that have spent years figuring out how to get you to spend money on stuff. They make the experience of buying stuff so pleasant that ""shopping"" becomes a leisure activity. How do you protect yourself from these people? It can't be easy. I'm a fairly skeptical person, and their tricks worked on me well into my thirties. But one thing that might work is to ask yourself, before buying something, ""is this going to make my life noticeably better?"" A friend of mine cured herself of a clothes buying habit by asking herself before she bought anything ""Am I going to wear this all the time?"" If she couldn't convince herself that something she was thinking of buying would become one of those few things she wore all the time, she wouldn't buy it. I think that would work for any kind of purchase. Before you buy anything, ask yourself: will this be something I use constantly? Or is it just something nice? Or worse still, a mere bargain? The worst stuff in this respect may be stuff you don't use much because it's too good. Nothing owns you like fragile stuff. For example, the ""good china"" so many households have, and whose defining quality is not so much that it's fun to use, but that one must be especially careful not to break it. Another way to resist acquiring stuff is to think of the overall cost of owning","It's not just the clutter, but the weight of the stuff, the
constant reminder that you have so much you can't use, can't get
rid of, and can't even see. It's a kind of psychological burden. You're not just surrounded by stuff, you're surrounded by the
unmanageable amount of it. That's why I think the solution is to stop
accumulating stuff. It's not that we have too much stuff, it's that we're
addicted to it. The problem is that we can't stop accumulating because we think
that accumulating stuff makes us more valuable. That's the key to the solution. We have to change the way we think about stuff. We have to stop thinking that stuff makes us more valuable. We have to think that stuff is just a means to an end. We have to stop thinking that we can afford to keep accumulating
stuff. We have to think that we don't have to. We have to stop thinking that we need it. We have to think that we don't. We have to stop thinking that it's necessary to own stuff. We have to think that it's not. And that's not just a matter of changing our thoughts, it's a matter of
changing the way our society is structured. That's why I think the solution is to stop accumulating stuff. So maybe the answer is to start thinking about stuff differently. Maybe the answer is to stop thinking that stuff is valuable, and to
stop thinking that we need it. Maybe the answer is to stop thinking that it's necessary to own stuff. Maybe the answer is to stop thinking that we can afford to keep
accumulating stuff. Maybe the answer is to start thinking that it's not necessary to
accumulate stuff. Maybe the answer is to start thinking that we don't need it. Maybe the answer is to start thinking that it's not necessary to
own it. Maybe the answer is to stop thinking",497,500,326,0.4008,0.2874,0.9796,0.8676,0.9119,0.8802,-1.3482,-1.8326,0.4077,0.2785,0.036,0.0405,0.0011,0.0036,0.6246,0.5435,0.9809,0.9081,0.4562607204116638,0.43771626297577854,0.49869451697127937,7,5,0.9648,0.9596,0.17303822937625754,0.156,0.17484662576687116,0.9887,0.4403,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,Some Heroes.txt,"April 2008
There are some topics I save up because they'll be so much fun to
write about. This is one of them: a list of my heroes. I'm not claiming this is a list of the n most admirable people. Who could make such a list, even if they wanted to? Einstein isn't on the list, for example, even though he probably
deserves to be on any shortlist of admirable people. I once asked
a physicist friend if Einstein was really as smart as his fame
implies, and she said that yes, he was. So why isn't he on the
list? Because I had to ask. This is a list of people who've
influenced me, not people who would have if I understood their work. My test was to think of someone and ask ""is this person my
hero?"" It often returned surprising answers. For example,
it returned false for Montaigne, who was arguably the inventor of
the essay. Why? When I thought
about what it meant to call someone a hero, it meant I'd decide what
to do by asking what they'd do in the same situation. That's a
stricter standard than admiration. After I made the list, I looked to see if there was a pattern, and
there was, a very clear one. Everyone on the list had two qualities:
they cared almost excessively about their work, and they were
absolutely honest. By honest I don't mean trustworthy so much as
that they never pander: they never say or do something because
that's what the audience wants. They are all fundamentally subversive
for this reason, though they conceal it to varying degrees. Jack Lambert
I grew up in Pittsburgh in the 1970s. Unless you were there it's
hard to imagine how that town felt about the Steelers. Locally,
all the news was bad. The steel industry was dying. But the
Steelers were the best team in football — and moreover, in a
way that seemed to reflect the personality of the city. They didn't
do anything fancy. They just got the job done. Other players were more famous: Terry Bradshaw, Franco Harris, Lynn
Swann. But they played offense, and you always get more attention
for that. It seemed to me as a twelve year old football expert
that the best of them all was
Jack Lambert. And what made him so
good was that he was utterly relentless. He didn't just care about
playing well; he cared almost too much. He seemed to regard it as
a personal insult when someone from the other team had possession
of the ball on his side of the line of scrimmage. The suburbs of Pittsburgh in the 1970s were a pretty dull place. School was boring. All the adults around were bored with their
jobs working for big companies. Everything that came to us through
the mass media was (a) blandly uniform and (b) produced elsewhere. Jack Lambert was the exception. He was like nothing else I'd seen.","Kenneth Clark Kenneth Clark is the best nonfiction writer I know of, on any subject. Most people who write about art history don't really like art; you can tell from a thousand little signs. But Clark did, and not just intellectually, but the way one anticipates a delicious dinner. What really makes him stand out, though, is the quality of his ideas. His style is deceptively casual, but there is more in his books than in a library of art monographs. Reading The Nude is like a ride in a Ferrari. Just as you're getting settled, you're slammed back in your seat by the acceleration. Before you can adjust, you're thrown sideways as the car screeches into the first turn. His brain throws off ideas almost too fast to grasp them. Finally at the end of the chapter you come to a halt, with your eyes wide and a big smile on your face. Kenneth Clark was a star in his day, thanks to the documentary series Civilisation. And if you read only one book about art history, Civilisation is the one I'd recommend. It's much better than the drab Sears Catalogs of art that undergraduates are forced to buy for Art History 101. Larry Mihalko A lot of people have a great teacher at some point in their childhood. Larry Mihalko was mine. When I look back it's like there's a line drawn between third and fourth grade. After Mr. Mihalko, everything was different. Why? First of all, he was intellectually curious. I had a few other teachers who were smart, but I wouldn't describe them as intellectually curious. In retrospect, he was out of place as an elementary school teacher, and I think he knew it. That must have been hard for him, but it was wonderful for us, his students. His class was a constant adventure. I used to like going to school every day. The other thing that made him different was that he liked us. Kids are good at telling that. The other teachers were at best benevolently indifferent. But Mr. Mihalko seemed like he actually wanted to be our friend. On the last day of fourth grade, he got out one of the heavy school record players and played James Taylor's ""You've Got a Friend"" to us. Just call out my name, and you know wherever I am, I'll come running. He died at 59 of lung cancer. I've never cried like I cried at his funeral. Leonardo One of the things I've learned about making things that I didn't realize when I was a kid is that much of the best stuff isn't made for audiences, but for oneself. You see paintings and drawings in museums and imagine they were made for you to look at. Actually a lot of the best ones were made as a way of exploring the world, not as a way to please other people. The best of these explorations are sometimes more pleasing than stuff made explicitly","I'd never seen a player who was so focused and so
intense. He was a kind of a quiet, unassuming
character. He was the kind of player that people might not have noticed if they
didn't look carefully. But once you looked, you couldn't
take your eyes off him. And that was the
kind of intensity that I wanted to be like. I wanted to be that kind of person —
someone who could be intense, focused, and unassuming. That's why I wanted to be a writer. I thought that if I could be that kind of writer, that if I could be
intense, focused, and unassuming, I would be able to write something that
would have the same kind of impact as Jack Lambert. I had to find a way to write like that. I had to find a way to be that kind of writer. I was trying to find a way to write like Jack Lambert.
Jack Lambert is the reason I became a writer. That's the story of how I became a writer.

Paul Graham,Five Questions about Language Design.txt,"May 2001
(These are some notes I made
for a panel discussion on programming language design
at MIT on May 10, 2001.)
1. Programming Languages Are for People. Programming languages
are how people talk to computers. The computer would be just as
happy speaking any language that was unambiguous. The reason we
have high level languages is because people can't deal with
machine language. The point of programming
languages is to prevent our poor frail human brains from being
overwhelmed by a mass of detail. Architects know that some kinds of design problems are more personal
than others. One of the cleanest, most abstract design problems
is designing bridges. There your job is largely a matter of spanning
a given distance with the least material. The other end of the
spectrum is designing chairs. Chair designers have to spend their
time thinking about human butts. Software varies in the same way. Designing algorithms for routing
data through a network is a nice, abstract problem, like designing
bridges. Whereas designing programming languages is like designing
chairs: it's all about dealing with human weaknesses. Most of us hate to acknowledge this. Designing systems of great
mathematical elegance sounds a lot more appealing to most of us
than pandering to human weaknesses. And there is a role for mathematical
elegance: some kinds of elegance make programs easier to understand. But elegance is not an end in itself. And when I say languages have to be designed to suit human weaknesses,
I don't mean that languages have to be designed for bad programmers. In fact I think you ought to design for the
best programmers, but
even the best programmers have limitations. I don't think anyone
would like programming in a language where all the variables were
the letter x with integer subscripts. 2. Design for Yourself and Your Friends. If you look at the history of programming languages, a lot of the best
ones were languages designed for their own authors to use, and a
lot of the worst ones were designed for other people to use. When languages are designed for other people, it's always a specific
group of other people: people not as smart as the language designer. So you get a language that talks down to you. Cobol is the most
extreme case, but a lot of languages are pervaded by this spirit. It has nothing to do with how abstract the language is. C is pretty
low-level, but it was designed for its authors to use, and that's
why hackers like it. The argument for designing languages for bad programmers is that
there are more bad programmers than good programmers. That may be
so. But those few good programmers write a disproportionately
large percentage of the software. I'm interested in the question, how do you design a language that
the very best hackers will like?","I happen to think this is identical to the question, how do you design a good programming language?, but even if it isn't, it is at least an interesting question. 3. Give the Programmer as Much Control as Possible. Many languages (especially the ones designed for other people) have the attitude of a governess: they try to prevent you from doing things that they think aren't good for you. I like the opposite approach: give the programmer as much control as you can. When I first learned Lisp, what I liked most about it was that it considered me an equal partner. In the other languages I had learned up till then, there was the language and there was my program, written in the language, and the two were very separate. But in Lisp the functions and macros I wrote were just like those that made up the language itself. I could rewrite the language if I wanted. It had the same appeal as open-source software. 4. Aim for Brevity. Brevity is underestimated and even scorned. But if you look into the hearts of hackers, you'll see that they really love it. How many times have you heard hackers speak fondly of how in, say, APL, they could do amazing things with just a couple lines of code? I think anything that really smart people really love is worth paying attention to. I think almost anything you can do to make programs shorter is good. There should be lots of library functions; anything that can be implicit should be; the syntax should be terse to a fault; even the names of things should be short. And it's not only programs that should be short. The manual should be thin as well. A good part of manuals is taken up with clarifications and reservations and warnings and special cases. If you force yourself to shorten the manual, in the best case you do it by fixing the things in the language that required so much explanation. 5. Admit What Hacking Is. A lot of people wish that hacking was mathematics, or at least something like a natural science. I think hacking is more like architecture. Architecture is related to physics, in the sense that architects have to design buildings that don't fall down, but the actual goal of architects is to make great buildings, not to make discoveries about statics. What hackers like to do is make great programs. And I think, at least in our own minds, we have to remember that it's an admirable thing to write great programs, even when this work doesn't translate easily into the conventional intellectual currency of research papers. Intellectually, it is just as worthwhile to design a language programmers will love as it is to design a horrible one that embodies some idea you can publish a paper about. 1. How to Organize Big Libraries? Libraries are becoming an increasingly important component of programming languages. They're also getting bigger, and this can be","3. The Case of the Language as a Communication Medium. The most important thing about a programming language is that it's
a communication medium between the human programmer and the
computer. A language is a way of saying things to the computer. It's a
way of saying things that are not obvious in the computer's
language. But the programmer is not just talking to the computer. The
programmer is also talking to other people. So the language is a
communication medium between the programmer and the computer, and
also between the programmer and other programmers. A lot of people don't realize that. For example, if you're writing a program in C, you're
writing a program that is going to be compiled into a machine
language. But the C code is not just a way of communicating with the
machine. It's also a way of communicating with other programmers. The C code is a way of saying things to other programmers, and the
language has to be designed so that it's possible for the
programmer to communicate with other programmers effectively. If you're writing a program in C, you're not just saying things to the
computer. You're saying things to the computer and to other people. So the language is a communication medium between the programmer
and the computer, and between the programmer and other people. The idea is that the language should be designed to make
communication between programmers as efficient as possible. So that's why languages are designed to be as close to the
computer as possible. Because the more the language is close to the computer, the more
you can make the communication between programmers more
efficient. For example, if you use a high-level language like Java, you have
to write a lot of boilerplate code, and that makes the code less
efficient in terms of communication between programmers. That is, the code is more verbose. So the more the language is high-level, the more the code",476,500,329,0.2952,0.246,0.9515,0.9216,0.9789,0.9131,0.3076,1.3556,0.4167,0.3902,0.0592,0.0681,0.0109,0.0076,0.5134,0.4332,0.9799,0.9694,0.4446529080675422,0.4717314487632509,0.5227882037533512,7,6,0.9725,0.9523,0.12605042016806722,0.142,0.14285714285714285,0.9418,0.5572,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,How to Start a Startup.txt,"Want to start a startup? Get funded by
Y Combinator. March 2005
(This essay is derived from a talk at the Harvard Computer
Society.)
You need three things to create a successful startup: to start with
good people, to make something customers actually want, and to spend
as little money as possible. Most startups that fail do it because
they fail at one of these. A startup that does all three will
probably succeed. And that's kind of exciting, when you think about it, because all
three are doable. Hard, but doable. And since a startup that
succeeds ordinarily makes its founders rich, that implies getting
rich is doable too. Hard, but doable. If there is one message I'd like to get across about startups,
that's it. There is no magically difficult step that requires
brilliance to solve. The Idea
In particular, you don't need a brilliant
idea to start a startup
around. The way a startup makes money is to offer people better
technology than they have now. But what people have now is often
so bad that it doesn't take brilliance to do better. Google's plan, for example, was simply to create a search site that
didn't suck. They had three new ideas: index more of the Web, use
links to rank search results, and have clean, simple web pages with
unintrusive keyword-based ads. Above all, they were determined to
make a site that was good to use. No doubt there are great technical
tricks within Google, but the overall plan was straightforward. And while they probably have bigger ambitions now, this alone brings
them a billion dollars a year. [1]
There are plenty of other areas that are just as backward as search
was before Google. I can think of several heuristics for generating
ideas for startups, but most reduce to this: look at something
people are trying to do, and figure out how to do it in a way that
doesn't suck. For example, dating sites currently suck far worse than search did
before Google. They all use the same simple-minded model. They seem to have approached the problem by thinking about how to
do database matches instead of how dating works in the real world. An undergrad could build something better as a class project. And
yet there's a lot of money at stake. Online dating is a valuable
business now, and it might be worth a hundred times as much if it
worked. An idea for a startup, however, is only a beginning. A lot of
would-be startup founders think the key to the whole process is the
initial idea, and from that point all you have to do is execute. Venture capitalists know better. If you go to VC firms with a
brilliant idea that you'll tell them about if they sign a nondisclosure
agreement, most will tell you to get lost. That shows how much a
mere idea is worth. The market price is less than the inconvenience
of signing an NDA.","Another sign of how little the initial idea is worth is the number of startups that change their plan en route. Microsoft's original plan was to make money selling programming languages, of all things. Their current business model didn't occur to them until IBM dropped it in their lap five years later. Ideas for startups are worth something, certainly, but the trouble is, they're not transferrable. They're not something you could hand to someone else to execute. Their value is mainly as starting points: as questions for the people who had them to continue thinking about. What matters is not ideas, but the people who have them. Good people can fix bad ideas, but good ideas can't save bad people. People What do I mean by good people? One of the best tricks I learned during our startup was a rule for deciding who to hire. Could you describe the person as an animal? It might be hard to translate that into another language, but I think everyone in the US knows what it means. It means someone who takes their work a little too seriously; someone who does what they do so well that they pass right through professional and cross over into obsessive. What it means specifically depends on the job: a salesperson who just won't take no for an answer; a hacker who will stay up till 4:00 AM rather than go to bed leaving code with a bug in it; a PR person who will cold-call New York Times reporters on their cell phones; a graphic designer who feels physical pain when something is two millimeters out of place. Almost everyone who worked for us was an animal at what they did. The woman in charge of sales was so tenacious that I used to feel sorry for potential customers on the phone with her. You could sense them squirming on the hook, but you knew there would be no rest for them till they'd signed up. If you think about people you know, you'll find the animal test is easy to apply. Call the person's image to mind and imagine the sentence ""so-and-so is an animal."" If you laugh, they're not. You don't need or perhaps even want this quality in big companies, but you need it in a startup. For programmers we had three additional tests. Was the person genuinely smart? If so, could they actually get things done? And finally, since a few good hackers have unbearable personalities, could we stand to have them around? That last test filters out surprisingly few people. We could bear any amount of nerdiness if someone was truly smart. What we couldn't stand were people with a lot of attitude. But most of those weren't truly smart, so our third test was largely a restatement of the first. When nerds are unbearable it's usually because they're trying too hard to seem smart. But the smarter they are, the less pressure they feel to act smart. So as","But what's the real value of an idea? It's not that
much. It's more like a
hypothesis. The value of an idea is in what it
can do. But if it doesn't work, you can always change the idea. So what's the point of having an idea? The point is to have a plan to test the idea. So the first step is to get people to try your idea. The
first step is to get people to try your idea. The first step is to get people to try your idea. The first step is to get people to try your idea. (That's from the book ""The Lean Startup"".) It's important to get people to try your idea because otherwise you
can't know if it's worth pursuing. If the idea doesn't work, you can
always change it. But if you don't try it, you never know. So the first step is to get people to try your idea. The
first step is to get people to try your idea. The first step is to get people to try your idea. The first step is to get people to try your idea. So what do you do when you have an idea? You build a prototype. You get people to try it. You learn what works and what doesn't. You get feedback. You iterate. The first step is to get people to try your idea. The first step is to get people to try your idea. The first step is to get people to try your idea. The first step is to get people to try your idea. You can't wait for the idea to be perfect. You have to get people to try it. If you don't, you can't know whether it's worth pursuing. The problem with the idea is that it's not tested. If you don't test it, you can't know if it's a good idea or not. So the first step is to get people to",500,500,329,0.2172,0.2146,0.9627,0.8966,0.9303,0.6609,1.1305,-5.1168,0.3917,0.3281,0.0426,0.0511,0.0063,0.0013,0.601,0.5161,0.9688,0.9234,0.4375,0.44035087719298244,0.46938775510204084,7,5,0.9594,0.8565,0.158,0.148,0.19148936170212766,0.9302,0.402,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,Mind the Gap.txt,"May 2004
When people care enough about something to do it well, those who
do it best tend to be far better than everyone else. There's a
huge gap between Leonardo and second-rate contemporaries like
Borgognone. You see the same gap between Raymond Chandler and the
average writer of detective novels. A top-ranked professional chess
player could play ten thousand games against an ordinary club player
without losing once. Like chess or painting or writing novels, making money is a very
specialized skill. But for some reason we treat this skill
differently. No one complains when a few people surpass all the
rest at playing chess or writing novels, but when a few people make
more money than the rest, we get editorials saying this is wrong. Why? The pattern of variation seems no different than for any other
skill. What causes people to react so strongly when the skill is
making money? I think there are three reasons we treat making money as different:
the misleading model of wealth we learn as children; the disreputable
way in which, till recently, most fortunes were accumulated; and
the worry that great variations in income are somehow bad for
society. As far as I can tell, the first is mistaken, the second
outdated, and the third empirically false. Could it be that, in a
modern democracy, variation in income is actually a sign of health? The Daddy Model of Wealth
When I was five I thought electricity was created by electric
sockets. I didn't realize there were power plants out there
generating it. Likewise, it doesn't occur to most kids that wealth
is something that has to be generated. It seems to be something
that flows from parents. Because of the circumstances in which they encounter it, children
tend to misunderstand wealth. They confuse it with money. They
think that there is a fixed amount of it. And they think of it as
something that's distributed by authorities (and so should be
distributed equally), rather than something that has to be created
(and might be created unequally). In fact, wealth is not money. Money is just a convenient way of
trading one form of wealth for another. Wealth is the underlying
stuff—the goods and services we buy. When you travel to a
rich or poor country, you don't have to look at people's bank
accounts to tell which kind you're in. You can see
wealth—in buildings and streets, in the clothes and the health
of the people. Where does wealth come from? People make it. This was easier to
grasp when most people lived on farms, and made many of the things
they wanted with their own hands. Then you could see in the house,
the herds, and the granary the wealth that each family created. It
was obvious then too that the wealth of the world was not a fixed
quantity that had to be shared out, like slices of a pie. If you
wanted more wealth, you could make it.","This is just as true today, though few of us create wealth directly for ourselves (except for a few vestigial domestic tasks). Mostly we create wealth for other people in exchange for money, which we then trade for the forms of wealth we want. [1] Because kids are unable to create wealth, whatever they have has to be given to them. And when wealth is something you're given, then of course it seems that it should be distributed equally. [2] As in most families it is. The kids see to that. ""Unfair,"" they cry, when one sibling gets more than another. In the real world, you can't keep living off your parents. If you want something, you either have to make it, or do something of equivalent value for someone else, in order to get them to give you enough money to buy it. In the real world, wealth is (except for a few specialists like thieves and speculators) something you have to create, not something that's distributed by Daddy. And since the ability and desire to create it vary from person to person, it's not made equally. You get paid by doing or making something people want, and those who make more money are often simply better at doing what people want. Top actors make a lot more money than B-list actors. The B-list actors might be almost as charismatic, but when people go to the theater and look at the list of movies playing, they want that extra oomph that the big stars have. Doing what people want is not the only way to get money, of course. You could also rob banks, or solicit bribes, or establish a monopoly. Such tricks account for some variation in wealth, and indeed for some of the biggest individual fortunes, but they are not the root cause of variation in income. The root cause of variation in income, as Occam's Razor implies, is the same as the root cause of variation in every other human skill. In the United States, the CEO of a large public company makes about 100 times as much as the average person. [3] Basketball players make about 128 times as much, and baseball players 72 times as much. Editorials quote this kind of statistic with horror. But I have no trouble imagining that one person could be 100 times as productive as another. In ancient Rome the price of slaves varied by a factor of 50 depending on their skills. [4] And that's without considering motivation, or the extra leverage in productivity that you can get from modern technology. Editorials about athletes' or CEOs' salaries remind me of early Christian writers, arguing from first principles about whether the Earth was round, when they could just walk outside and check. [5] How much someone's work is worth is not a policy question. It's something the market already determines. ""Are they really worth 100 of us?"" editorialists ask. Depends on what you mean by worth. If you mean","But now people have
moved from farms to cities, and most of the goods they buy are
not made by themselves. The process of making things is no longer
visible. So we've lost the connection between wealth and the work
that creates it. The model we now have is a misleading one. We think that
wealth is something that is given to us by the government, or that
we get from the people we are born to. That's why so many people
believe that it's the government's job to give us wealth, and that
there's a fixed amount that has to be divided equally. We have to
relearn the real connection between wealth and work. The Disreputable Way
This was not always the case. In the past, it was common for
wealth to be created through honest work. People who created
wealth were seen as the heroes of the world. In fact, in the past
it was common for the rich to be people who worked very hard and
were considered to be virtuous. But then, after the industrial revolution, things changed. The methods of
producing wealth began to change. The old ways of making
things were replaced by machines, and the people who made those
machines became the ones who were rich. But the people who made the machines were not the ones who were
working. They were the people who had the means of production. The owners of the factories. The workers were no longer the ones who
were creating wealth. They were the ones who were being paid to do the work. The
wealth was created by the people who owned the means of
production, not by the people who were working. This is a big
shift in the way people think about the source of wealth. The result of this shift was that the people who created wealth were
no longer seen as heroes, but as villains. The people who owned the factories were now called industrialists",500,500,331,0.3355,0.3816,0.98,0.9093,0.9706,0.9148,0.4829,-1.3601,0.4343,0.3986,0.0653,0.0713,0.0118,0.0129,0.4532,0.5129,0.9853,0.9556,0.45598591549295775,0.40955631399317405,0.5217391304347826,7,6,0.9689,0.958,0.14,0.176,0.11178247734138973,0.9519,0.6868,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,The Equity Equation.txt,"July 2007
An investor wants to give you money for a certain percentage of
your startup. Should you take it? You're about to hire your first
employee. How much stock should you give him? These are some of the hardest questions founders face. And yet
both have the same answer:
1/(1 - n)
Whenever you're trading stock in your company for anything, whether
it's money or an employee or a deal with another company, the test
for whether to do it is the same. You should give up n% of your
company if what you trade it for improves your average outcome
enough that the (100 - n)% you have left is worth more than the
whole company was before. For example, if an investor wants to buy half your company, how
much does that investment have to improve your average outcome for
you to break even? Obviously it has to double: if you trade half
your company for something that more than doubles the company's
average outcome, you're net ahead. You have half as big a share
of something worth more than twice as much. In the general case, if n is the fraction of the company you're
giving up, the deal is a good one if it makes the company worth
more than 1/(1 - n). For example, suppose Y Combinator offers to fund you in return for
7% of your company. In this case, n is .07 and 1/(1 - n) is 1.075. So you should take the deal if you believe we can improve your
average outcome by more than 7.5%. If we improve your outcome by
10%, you're net ahead, because the remaining .93 you hold is worth
.93 x 1.1 = 1.023. [1]
One of the things the equity equation shows us is that, financially
at least, taking money from a top VC firm can be a really good deal. Greg Mcadoo from Sequoia recently said at a YC dinner that when
Sequoia invests alone they like to take about 30% of a company. 1/.7 = 1.43, meaning that deal is worth taking if they can improve
your outcome by more than 43%. For the average startup, that would
be an extraordinary bargain. It would improve the average startup's
prospects by more than 43% just to be able to say they were funded
by Sequoia, even if they never actually got the money. The reason Sequoia is such a good deal is that the percentage of
the company they take is artificially low. They don't even try to
get market price for their investment; they limit their holdings
to leave the founders enough stock to feel the company is still
theirs. The catch is that Sequoia gets about 6000 business plans a year and
funds about 20 of them, so the odds of getting this great deal are
1 in 300. The companies that make it through are not average startups. Of course, there are other factors to consider in a VC deal.","It's never just a straight trade of money for stock. But if it were, taking money from a top firm would generally be a bargain. You can use the same formula when giving stock to employees, but it works in the other direction. If i is the average outcome for the company with the addition of some new person, then they're worth n such that i = 1/(1 - n). Which means n = (i - 1)/i. For example, suppose you're just two founders and you want to hire an additional hacker who's so good you feel he'll increase the average outcome of the whole company by 20%. n = (1.2 - 1)/1.2 = .167. So you'll break even if you trade 16.7% of the company for him. That doesn't mean 16.7% is the right amount of stock to give him. Stock is not the only cost of hiring someone: there's usually salary and overhead as well. And if the company merely breaks even on the deal, there's no reason to do it. I think to translate salary and overhead into stock you should multiply the annual rate by about 1.5. Most startups grow fast or die; if you die you don't have to pay the guy, and if you grow fast you'll be paying next year's salary out of next year's valuation, which should be 3x this year's. If your valuation grows 3x a year, the total cost in stock of a new hire's salary and overhead is 1.5 years' cost at the present valuation. [2] How much of an additional margin should the company need as the ""activation energy"" for the deal? Since this is in effect the company's profit on a hire, the market will determine that: if you're a hot opportunity, you can charge more. Let's run through an example. Suppose the company wants to make a ""profit"" of 50% on the new hire mentioned above. So subtract a third from 16.7% and we have 11.1% as his ""retail"" price. Suppose further that he's going to cost $60k a year in salary and overhead, x 1.5 = $90k total. If the company's valuation is $2 million, $90k is 4.5%. 11.1% - 4.5% = an offer of 6.6%. Incidentally, notice how important it is for early employees to take little salary. It comes right out of stock that could otherwise be given to them. Obviously there is a great deal of play in these numbers. I'm not claiming that stock grants can now be reduced to a formula. Ultimately you always have to guess. But at least know what you're guessing. If you choose a number based on your gut feel, or a table of typical grant sizes supplied by a VC firm, understand what those are estimates of. And more generally, when you make any decision involving equity, run it through 1/(1 - n) to see if it makes sense. You should always feel richer after trading equity. If the trade didn't increase the value of","But
the formula is the same. So if you're going to take a deal, you need to know
what your company's worth and how much it can improve. The formula 1/(1 - n) is a good way to think about it. [1] The original calculation was 1.075, and the
author made a mistake in the text. The correct calculation is 1.075, but the author
intended to say 1.075 (which is the same thing). So that was a mistake, but it's not a big one. The key idea is that if you give up n, the company has to be worth
more than 1/(1 - n) for the deal to be a good one. [1] In the example where the investor is taking half the company, the
author says ""it has to double."" That is correct. If you trade half your company for something that more than doubles
the company's average outcome, you're net ahead. So you have half as much of something worth more than twice as much. That is a net gain. [1] The author later says that if the outcome improves by 10%, you're net
ahead. The calculation is.93 x 1.1 = 1.023, which is correct. So, 10% is more than the 7.5% that is needed. The author is correct in that calculation. [1] The author also says that if you give up n, the company has to be worth
more than 1/(1 - n) for the deal to be a good one. That is correct. [1] The author also says that the formula is 1/(1 - n). That is correct. [1] The author also says that the formula is the same in any deal, whether

Paul Graham,The Age of the Essay.txt,"September 2004
Remember the essays you had to write in high school? Topic sentence, introductory paragraph,
supporting paragraphs, conclusion. The conclusion being,
say, that Ahab in Moby Dick was a Christ-like figure. Oy. So I'm going to try to give the other side of the
story: what an essay really is, and how you write one. Or at least, how I write one. Mods
The most obvious difference between real essays and
the things one has to write in school is that real
essays are not exclusively about English literature. Certainly schools should teach students how to
write. But due to a series of historical accidents
the teaching of
writing has gotten mixed together with the study
of literature. And so all over the country students are
writing not about how a baseball team with a small budget
might compete with the Yankees, or the role of color in
fashion, or what constitutes a good dessert, but about
symbolism in Dickens. With the result that writing is made to seem boring and
pointless. Who cares about symbolism in Dickens? Dickens himself would be more interested in an essay
about color or baseball. How did things get this way? To answer that we have to go back
almost a thousand years. Around 1100, Europe at last began to
catch its breath after centuries of chaos, and once they
had the luxury of curiosity they rediscovered
what we call ""the classics."" The effect was rather as if
we were visited by beings from another solar system. These earlier civilizations were so much more sophisticated
that for the next several centuries the main work of
European scholars, in almost every field, was to assimilate
what they knew. During this period the study of ancient texts acquired great
prestige. It seemed the essence of what scholars did. As
European scholarship gained momentum it became less and less important;
by 1350
someone who wanted to learn about science could find better
teachers than Aristotle in his own era. [1]
But schools change slower than scholarship. In the
19th century the study of ancient texts was still the backbone
of the curriculum. The time was then ripe for the question: if the study of
ancient texts is a valid field for scholarship, why not modern
texts? The answer, of course, is that the original raison d'etre
of classical scholarship was a kind of intellectual archaeology that
does not need to be done in the case of contemporary authors. But for obvious reasons no one wanted to give that answer. The archaeological work being mostly done, it implied that
those studying the classics were, if not wasting their
time, at least working on problems of minor importance. And so began the study of modern literature. There was a good
deal of resistance at first. The first courses in English literature
seem to have been offered by the newer colleges, particularly
American ones.","Dartmouth, the University of Vermont, Amherst, and University College, London taught English literature in the 1820s. But Harvard didn't have a professor of English literature until 1876, and Oxford not till 1885. (Oxford had a chair of Chinese before it had one of English.) [2] What tipped the scales, at least in the US, seems to have been the idea that professors should do research as well as teach. This idea (along with the PhD, the department, and indeed the whole concept of the modern university) was imported from Germany in the late 19th century. Beginning at Johns Hopkins in 1876, the new model spread rapidly. Writing was one of the casualties. Colleges had long taught English composition. But how do you do research on composition? The professors who taught math could be required to do original math, the professors who taught history could be required to write scholarly articles about history, but what about the professors who taught rhetoric or composition? What should they do research on? The closest thing seemed to be English literature. [3] And so in the late 19th century the teaching of writing was inherited by English professors. This had two drawbacks: (a) an expert on literature need not himself be a good writer, any more than an art historian has to be a good painter, and (b) the subject of writing now tends to be literature, since that's what the professor is interested in. High schools imitate universities. The seeds of our miserable high school experiences were sown in 1892, when the National Education Association ""formally recommended that literature and composition be unified in the high school course."" [4] The 'riting component of the 3 Rs then morphed into English, with the bizarre consequence that high school students now had to write about English literature-- to write, without even realizing it, imitations of whatever English professors had been publishing in their journals a few decades before. It's no wonder if this seems to the student a pointless exercise, because we're now three steps removed from real work: the students are imitating English professors, who are imitating classical scholars, who are merely the inheritors of a tradition growing out of what was, 700 years ago, fascinating and urgently needed work. No Defense The other big difference between a real essay and the things they make you write in school is that a real essay doesn't take a position and then defend it. That principle, like the idea that we ought to be writing about literature, turns out to be another intellectual hangover of long forgotten origins. It's often mistakenly believed that medieval universities were mostly seminaries. In fact they were more law schools. And at least in our tradition lawyers are advocates, trained to take either side of an argument and make as good a case for it as they can. Whether cause or effect, this spirit pervaded early universities. The study of rhetoric, the art of arguing persuasively, was a third of the undergraduate","But the movement gained momentum when the
University of London, in 1894, began to offer a degree in
modern English literature. [2]
This movement, however, was not merely a
curricular change. It was a cultural one. The
influence of the classics, which had been dominant in the
European intellectual world for centuries, began to
diminish. The classics, though, were not entirely replaced. There was
still a demand for their study. But now, as the
new disciplines of history and science began to
take over the place of the classics, the classics
were seen as a kind of luxury. The result was that the
study of literature, which had begun as a
serious intellectual endeavor, became
increasingly associated with the study of
literature as a subject of study in schools, rather than as
a serious intellectual pursuit. [3]
This is not to say that the study of literature is not
a serious intellectual endeavor. But what has
happened is that the study of literature has become a
field of study in schools, not as a serious intellectual
pursuit, but as a kind of subject. In other words, the study of literature is now
a subject, not an intellectual discipline. And this is the main problem. The result is that students are taught to write about
literature rather than to write. The subject of writing is not being taught, but the subject of literature is being taught. And the problem is that the two are not the same.
So, how do we solve this problem? One solution is to
teach writing as a subject in itself. But that is not
what is happening. The problem is that writing is being taught
through literature. That is, we are teaching students to write
essays by having them write about literature. Instead of writing about the world, they are writing about literature. And that's a problem",485,500,311,0.2181,0.2846,0.992,0.9695,0.8037,0.8718,3.9733,-2.0848,0.395,0.4258,0.0719,0.0846,0.0166,0.0203,0.5614,0.547,0.9878,0.9775,0.4319852941176471,0.41450777202072536,0.4972067039106145,7,6,0.9389,0.9828,0.12577319587628866,0.162,0.15112540192926044,0.943,0.6272,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,The List of N Things.txt,"September 2009
I bet you the current issue of Cosmopolitan has an article
whose title begins with a number. ""7 Things He Won't Tell You about
Sex,"" or something like that. Some popular magazines
feature articles of this type on the cover of every
issue. That can't be happening by accident. Editors must know
they attract readers. Why do readers like the list of n things so much? Mainly because
it's easier to read than a regular article. [1]
Structurally, the list of n things is a degenerate case of essay. An essay can go anywhere the writer wants. In a list of n things
the writer agrees to constrain himself to a collection of points
of roughly equal importance, and he tells the reader explicitly
what they are. Some of the work of reading an article is understanding its
structure—figuring out what in high school we'd have called
its ""outline."" Not explicitly, of course, but someone who really
understands an article probably has something in his brain afterward
that corresponds to such an outline. In a list of n things, this
work is done for you. Its structure is an exoskeleton. As well as being explicit, the structure is guaranteed to be of the
simplest possible type: a few main points with few to no subordinate
ones, and no particular connection between them. Because the main points are unconnected, the list of n things is
random access. There's no thread of reasoning you have to follow. You could
read the list in any order. And because the points are independent
of one another, they work like watertight compartments in an
unsinkable ship. If you get bored with, or can't understand, or
don't agree with one point, you don't have to give up on the article. You can just abandon that one and skip to the next. A list of n
things is parallel and therefore fault tolerant. There are times when this format is what a writer wants. One, obviously,
is when what you have to say actually is a list of n
things. I once wrote an essay about the mistakes that kill startups, and a few people made fun of me
for writing something whose title began with a number. But in that
case I really was trying to make a complete catalog of a number of
independent things. In fact, one of the questions I was trying to
answer was how many there were. There are other less legitimate reasons for using this format. For
example, I use it when I get close to a deadline. If I have to
give a talk and I haven't started it a few days beforehand, I'll
sometimes play it safe and make the talk a list of n things. The list of n things is easier for writers as well as readers. When
you're writing a real essay, there's always a chance you'll hit a
dead end.","A real essay is a train of thought, and some trains of thought just peter out. That's an alarming possibility when you have to give a talk in a few days. What if you run out of ideas? The compartmentalized structure of the list of n things protects the writer from his own stupidity in much the same way it protects the reader. If you run out of ideas on one point, no problem: it won't kill the essay. You can take out the whole point if you need to, and the essay will still survive. Writing a list of n things is so relaxing. You think of n/2 of them in the first 5 minutes. So bang, there's the structure, and you just have to fill it in. As you think of more points, you just add them to the end. Maybe you take out or rearrange or combine a few, but at every stage you have a valid (though initially low-res) list of n things. It's like the sort of programming where you write a version 1 very quickly and then gradually modify it, but at every point have working code—or the style of painting where you begin with a complete but very blurry sketch done in an hour, then spend a week cranking up the resolution. Because the list of n things is easier for writers too, it's not always a damning sign when readers prefer it. It's not necessarily evidence readers are lazy; it could also mean they don't have much confidence in the writer. The list of n things is in that respect the cheeseburger of essay forms. If you're eating at a restaurant you suspect is bad, your best bet is to order the cheeseburger. Even a bad cook can make a decent cheeseburger. And there are pretty strict conventions about what a cheeseburger should look like. You can assume the cook isn't going to try something weird and artistic. The list of n things similarly limits the damage that can be done by a bad writer. You know it's going to be about whatever the title says, and the format prevents the writer from indulging in any flights of fancy. Because the list of n things is the easiest essay form, it should be a good one for beginning writers. And in fact it is what most beginning writers are taught. The classic 5 paragraph essay is really a list of n things for n = 3. But the students writing them don't realize they're using the same structure as the articles they read in Cosmopolitan. They're not allowed to include the numbers, and they're expected to spackle over the gaps with gratuitous transitions (""Furthermore..."") and cap the thing at either end with introductory and concluding paragraphs so it will look superficially like a real essay. [2] It seems a fine plan to start students off with the list of n things. It's the easiest form. But if we're going to do that,","If you're writing a list of n things, you can just write each
point separately. You can write one point, and then go on to the next. If you get stuck on a point, you can just skip it. And the reader can skip it as well. The problem with an essay is that you have to write it in sequence. You can't just skip ahead. The list of n things is a way of writing that allows the reader to
skip around. So it's not that the list of n things is a bad form. It's that the essay is a more difficult form. In this case, the essay is the more difficult form. [2]
The author is arguing that a list of n things is a form of writing that is
easier for both readers and writers. The author gives several reasons to support this argument. The author's tone is
A. skeptical
B. supportive
C. critical
D. neutral

Okay, let's try to figure out the answer here. The question is about the author's tone in the given passage. The options are skeptical, supportive, critical, or neutral. 

First, I need to recall what the passage is about. The author starts by talking about how magazines use articles with titles starting with numbers, like ""7 Things He Won't Tell You about Sex,"" and explains that this format is popular because it's easier for readers. The author then goes on to discuss how lists of n things are a type of essay that's structured in a way that makes it easier for both readers and writers. The author mentions that lists are like exoskeletons, they're explicit, have a simple structure, allow readers to skip around, and that they're fault-tolerant. The author also gives examples where using a list is appropriate, like when the content is actually a list, or when a writer is close to a deadline. The author also contrasts this with essays, which are more difficult",488,500,327,0.4401,0.3294,0.9854,0.9859,0.9085,0.8669,1.5792,-2.0875,0.4511,0.435,0.0898,0.0938,0.0345,0.0446,0.6209,0.5881,0.9785,0.9662,0.45,0.46397188049209137,0.4409448818897638,8,7,0.9857,0.994,0.14754098360655737,0.146,0.18042813455657492,0.9672,0.8293,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,How to Make Wealth.txt,"Want to start a startup? Get funded by
Y Combinator. May 2004
(This essay was originally published in Hackers
& Painters.)
If you wanted to get rich, how would you do it? I think your best
bet would be to start or join a startup. That's been a
reliable way to get rich for hundreds of years. The word ""startup""
dates from the 1960s, but what happens in one is
very similar to the venture-backed trading voyages of the
Middle Ages. Startups usually involve technology, so much so that the phrase
""high-tech startup"" is almost redundant. A startup is a small
company that takes on a hard technical problem. Lots of people get rich knowing nothing more than that. You don't have to know physics to be a good pitcher. But
I think it could give you an edge to understand the underlying principles. Why do startups have to be small? Will a startup inevitably stop being a startup as it
grows larger? And why do they so often work on
developing new technology? Why are there so many startups
selling new drugs or computer software, and none selling corn oil
or laundry detergent? The Proposition
Economically, you can think of a startup as a way to
compress your whole working life into a few years. Instead
of working at a low intensity for forty years, you work as
hard as you possibly can for four. This pays especially well
in technology, where you earn a premium for working fast. Here is a brief sketch of the economic proposition. If you're
a good hacker in your mid twenties, you can
get a job paying about $80,000 per year. So on average
such a hacker must be
able to do at least $80,000 worth of work per year for the
company just to break even. You could probably
work twice as many hours as a corporate employee, and if
you focus you can probably get three times as much done in
an hour. [1]
You should get another multiple of two, at
least, by eliminating the drag
of the pointy-haired middle
manager who would be your boss in a big company. Then there is one more multiple: how much smarter are you
than your job description expects you to be? Suppose another multiple of three. Combine all these multipliers, and I'm
claiming you could be 36 times more
productive than you're expected to be in a random corporate
job. [2]
If a fairly good hacker is worth $80,000 a year at a
big company, then a smart
hacker working very hard without any corporate
bullshit to slow him down should be able to do work worth about
$3 million a year. Like all back-of-the-envelope calculations, this one
has a lot of wiggle room. I wouldn't try to
defend the actual numbers. But I stand by the
structure of the calculation.","I'm not claiming the multiplier is precisely 36, but it is certainly more than 10, and probably rarely as high as 100. If $3 million a year seems high, remember that we're talking about the limit case: the case where you not only have zero leisure time but indeed work so hard that you endanger your health. Startups are not magic. They don't change the laws of wealth creation. They just represent a point at the far end of the curve. There is a conservation law at work here: if you want to make a million dollars, you have to endure a million dollars' worth of pain. For example, one way to make a million dollars would be to work for the Post Office your whole life, and save every penny of your salary. Imagine the stress of working for the Post Office for fifty years. In a startup you compress all this stress into three or four years. You do tend to get a certain bulk discount if you buy the economy-size pain, but you can't evade the fundamental conservation law. If starting a startup were easy, everyone would do it. Millions, not Billions If $3 million a year seems high to some people, it will seem low to others. Three million? How do I get to be a billionaire, like Bill Gates? So let's get Bill Gates out of the way right now. It's not a good idea to use famous rich people as examples, because the press only write about the very richest, and these tend to be outliers. Bill Gates is a smart, determined, and hardworking man, but you need more than that to make as much money as he has. You also need to be very lucky. There is a large random factor in the success of any company. So the guys you end up reading about in the papers are the ones who are very smart, totally dedicated, and win the lottery. Certainly Bill is smart and dedicated, but Microsoft also happens to have been the beneficiary of one of the most spectacular blunders in the history of business: the licensing deal for DOS. No doubt Bill did everything he could to steer IBM into making that blunder, and he has done an excellent job of exploiting it, but if there had been one person with a brain on IBM's side, Microsoft's future would have been very different. Microsoft at that stage had little leverage over IBM. They were effectively a component supplier. If IBM had required an exclusive license, as they should have, Microsoft would still have signed the deal. It would still have meant a lot of money for them, and IBM could easily have gotten an operating system elsewhere. Instead IBM ended up using all its power in the market to give Microsoft control of the PC standard. From that point, all Microsoft had to do was execute. They never had to bet the company on a bold decision. All they","So, if you're a hacker, you could be
making $3 million a year by starting a company. That's the
economic proposition of a startup. [3]
The question is, how do you get that $3 million? Well, if you're not rich, you're probably going to need
some money to start up. So the idea of a startup is that you can raise a
small amount of money, and then grow the company. If you're a
hacker, you can raise $200,000 from a
few investors. That would be enough to start a company. You could do this, for example, by building a
website and selling ads. You could also do this by building a
software company. Or even a hardware company, if you had
the right idea. The idea is that the startup will grow, and
will become worth a lot. The investors will then get a
return on their investment. But how can you be sure that the company will become worth a lot? That's where the second part of the startup
proposition comes in. The second part is the
probability of success. If you're a hacker, you have an
interesting set of skills that are hard to
find. You can write software, you can think about problems in
a certain way, and you can do a lot of things in a short
time. These are all very valuable skills, but they are also very
hard to quantify. So how do you get a
return on investment? The answer is that the return is not from the
investor. It's from the
company. The company is the one that will grow to be
worth a lot. If the company is worth a lot, the
investors get a return. So the question is, what is the chance that the company will become
worth a lot? The answer is: it's not very high.",479,500,309,0.2251,0.3034,0.9786,0.9454,0.9373,0.8024,1.0634,-3.1432,0.4041,0.4279,0.0499,0.067,0.0022,0.0074,0.585,0.7217,0.9756,0.9712,0.42201834862385323,0.4454225352112676,0.5,6,6,0.9472,0.9624,0.14822546972860126,0.136,0.1779935275080906,0.9303,0.6762,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,Programming Bottom-Up.txt,"1993
(This essay is from the introduction to On Lisp.)
It's a long-standing principle of programming style that the functional
elements of a program should not be too large. If some component of a
program grows beyond the stage where it's readily comprehensible,
it becomes a mass of complexity which conceals errors as easily
as a big city conceals fugitives. Such software will be
hard to read, hard to test, and hard to debug. In accordance with this principle, a large program must be divided
into pieces, and the larger the program, the more it must be divided. How do you divide a program? The traditional approach is
called top-down design: you say ""the purpose of the
program is to do these seven things, so I divide it into seven major
subroutines. The first subroutine has to do these four things, so
it in turn will have four of its own subroutines,"" and so on. This process continues until the whole program has the right level
of granularity-- each part large enough to do something substantial,
but small enough to be understood as a single unit. Experienced Lisp programmers divide up their programs differently. As well as top-down design, they follow a principle which
could be called bottom-up design-- changing the language
to suit the problem. In Lisp, you don't just write your program down toward the language,
you also build the language up toward your program. As you're
writing a program you may think ""I wish Lisp had such-and-such an
operator."" So you go and write it. Afterward
you realize that using the new operator would simplify the design
of another part of the program, and so on. Language and program evolve together. Like the border between two warring states,
the boundary between language and program is drawn and redrawn,
until eventually it comes to rest along the mountains and rivers,
the natural frontiers of your problem. In the end your program will look as if the language had been
designed for it. And when language and
program fit one another well, you end up with code which is
clear, small, and efficient. It's worth emphasizing that bottom-up design doesn't mean
just writing the same program in a different order. When you
work bottom-up, you usually end up with a different program. Instead of a single, monolithic program,
you will get a larger language with more abstract operators,
and a smaller program written in it. Instead of a lintel,
you'll get an arch. In typical code, once you abstract out the parts which are
merely bookkeeping, what's left is much shorter;
the higher you build up the language, the less distance you
will have to travel from the top down to it. This brings several advantages:
By making the language do more of the work, bottom-up design
yields programs which are smaller and more agile. A shorter
program doesn't have to be divided into so many components, and
fewer components means programs which are easier to read or
modify.","Fewer components also means fewer connections between components, and thus less chance for errors there. As industrial designers strive to reduce the number of moving parts in a machine, experienced Lisp programmers use bottom-up design to reduce the size and complexity of their programs. Bottom-up design promotes code re-use. When you write two or more programs, many of the utilities you wrote for the first program will also be useful in the succeeding ones. Once you've acquired a large substrate of utilities, writing a new program can take only a fraction of the effort it would require if you had to start with raw Lisp. Bottom-up design makes programs easier to read. An instance of this type of abstraction asks the reader to understand a general-purpose operator; an instance of functional abstraction asks the reader to understand a special-purpose subroutine. [1] Because it causes you always to be on the lookout for patterns in your code, working bottom-up helps to clarify your ideas about the design of your program. If two distant components of a program are similar in form, you'll be led to notice the similarity and perhaps to redesign the program in a simpler way. Bottom-up design is possible to a certain degree in languages other than Lisp. Whenever you see library functions, bottom-up design is happening. However, Lisp gives you much broader powers in this department, and augmenting the language plays a proportionately larger role in Lisp style-- so much so that Lisp is not just a different language, but a whole different way of programming. It's true that this style of development is better suited to programs which can be written by small groups. However, at the same time, it extends the limits of what can be done by a small group. In The Mythical Man-Month, Frederick Brooks proposed that the productivity of a group of programmers does not grow linearly with its size. As the size of the group increases, the productivity of individual programmers goes down. The experience of Lisp programming suggests a more cheerful way to phrase this law: as the size of the group decreases, the productivity of individual programmers goes up. A small group wins, relatively speaking, simply because it's smaller. When a small group also takes advantage of the techniques that Lisp makes possible, it can win outright. New: Download On Lisp for Free. [1] ""But no one can read the program without understanding all your new utilities."" To see why such statements are usually mistaken, see Section 4.8.","The language is more expressive. The program is more
readable, because it's written in a language that's been
shaped to fit the problem. The program is more efficient, because the language
is more expressive. More expressive languages allow for more efficient
code, by allowing the programmer to express ideas more
directly. The program is more elegant. A language that's been built to fit the problem is
more elegant. The more elegant the code, the more elegant the language.
In summary, bottom-up design is a more effective way of
building programs, and it's also a more elegant way of
thinking about them. The traditional top-down approach is not
as effective, and is not as elegant. The idea is that when you build the language, you are
not merely writing a program in a given language, but
you're also building a language. The two are not
separate, but are part of the same process. The bottom-up approach is more
effective, because you can build a more
appropriate language for the problem. The traditional top-down approach is less
effective, because it forces you to work in a language that
may not be the most appropriate for the problem. This is a very good point. I have been writing in Lisp for
more than ten years, and in that time I've been writing a number
of different languages. I've written a number of different
languages, each of which was used in a different way. The
reason is that the language is not a fixed thing. It's not a
language you use to write programs. It's a language that you
use to write programs, and that you also write. In that sense, the language is not a
fixed thing, but a dynamic thing that you build. So, the language is not a
fixed, static entity, but something that can be
modified, extended, and even redefined.

Paul Graham,A Project of One's Own.txt,"June 2021
A few days ago, on the way home from school, my nine year old son
told me he couldn't wait to get home to write more of the story he
was working on. This made me as happy as anything I've heard him
say — not just because he was excited about his story, but because
he'd discovered this way of working. Working on a project of your
own is as different from ordinary work as skating is from walking. It's more fun, but also much more productive. What proportion of great work has been done by people who were
skating in this sense? If not all of it, certainly a lot. There is something special about working on a project of your own. I wouldn't say exactly that you're happier. A better word would be
excited, or engaged. You're happy when things are going well, but
often they aren't. When I'm writing an essay, most of the time I'm
worried and puzzled: worried that the essay will turn out badly,
and puzzled because I'm groping for some idea that I can't see
clearly enough. Will I be able to pin it down with words? In the
end I usually can, if I take long enough, but I'm never sure; the
first few attempts often fail. You have moments of happiness when things work out, but they don't
last long, because then you're on to the next problem. So why do
it at all? Because to the kind of people who like working this way,
nothing else feels as right. You feel as if you're an animal in its
natural habitat, doing what you were meant to do — not always
happy, maybe, but awake and alive. Many kids experience the excitement of working on projects of their
own. The hard part is making this converge with the work you do as
an adult. And our customs make it harder. We treat ""playing"" and
""hobbies"" as qualitatively different from ""work"". It's not clear
to a kid building a treehouse that there's a direct (though long)
route from that to architecture or engineering. And instead of
pointing out the route, we conceal it, by implicitly treating the
stuff kids do as different from real work. [1]
Instead of telling kids that their treehouses could be on the path
to the work they do as adults, we tell them the path goes through
school. And unfortunately schoolwork tends to be very different from
working on projects of one's own. It's usually neither a project,
nor one's own. So as school gets more serious, working on projects
of one's own is something that survives, if at all, as a thin thread
off to the side.","It's a bit sad to think of all the high school kids turning their backs on building treehouses and sitting in class dutifully learning about Darwin or Newton to pass some exam, when the work that made Darwin and Newton famous was actually closer in spirit to building treehouses than studying for exams. If I had to choose between my kids getting good grades and working on ambitious projects of their own, I'd pick the projects. And not because I'm an indulgent parent, but because I've been on the other end and I know which has more predictive value. When I was picking startups for Y Combinator, I didn't care about applicants' grades. But if they'd worked on projects of their own, I wanted to hear all about those. [2] It may be inevitable that school is the way it is. I'm not saying we have to redesign it (though I'm not saying we don't), just that we should understand what it does to our attitudes to work — that it steers us toward the dutiful plodding kind of work, often using competition as bait, and away from skating. There are occasionally times when schoolwork becomes a project of one's own. Whenever I had to write a paper, that would become a project of my own — except in English classes, ironically, because the things one has to write in English classes are so bogus . And when I got to college and started taking CS classes, the programs I had to write became projects of my own. Whenever I was writing or programming, I was usually skating, and that has been true ever since. So where exactly is the edge of projects of one's own? That's an interesting question, partly because the answer is so complicated, and partly because there's so much at stake. There turn out to be two senses in which work can be one's own: 1) that you're doing it voluntarily, rather than merely because someone told you to, and 2) that you're doing it by yourself. The edge of the former is quite sharp. People who care a lot about their work are usually very sensitive to the difference between pulling, and being pushed, and work tends to fall into one category or the other. But the test isn't simply whether you're told to do something. You can choose to do something you're told to do. Indeed, you can own it far more thoroughly than the person who told you to do it. For example, math homework is for most people something they're told to do. But for my father, who was a mathematician, it wasn't. Most of us think of the problems in a math book as a way to test or develop our knowledge of the material explained in each section. But to my father the problems were the part that mattered, and the text was merely a sort of annotation. Whenever he got a new math book it was to him like","[2] [3] So it's a big mistake to treat school as a place for preparation
for the adult world, when the real work of the adult world is
not just the work that is done in an office, but the work that is
done in a project, and in the work that is done in the world of
one's own interests. [4]
[1] This is the first paragraph of the text. The author says that when a child is working on a project, it's not just that they're having fun but also that they're more productive. The author is trying to make the point that working on projects is a form of work that is different from the ordinary work, which is often more rigid and not as productive. The author is trying to argue that this kind of work is valuable and should be encouraged. The author is also trying to argue that the education system should not treat this kind of work as something separate from real work.

This is because the process of creating is not always straightforward, and there are many obstacles. The author is trying to show that the process of working on a project is not always easy, but it's also rewarding when it works out. The author is trying to argue that the value of this kind of work is not just in the end product, but in the process of creating.

The author is trying to explain that the education system tends to treat ""playing"" and ""hobbies"" as separate from ""work"", which can make it harder for children to see the connection between their interests and their future work.

Paul Graham,Haters.txt,"January 2020
(I originally intended this for startup founders, who are often
surprised by the attention they get as their companies grow, but
it applies equally to anyone who becomes famous.)
If you become sufficiently famous, you'll acquire some fans who
like you too much. These people are sometimes called ""fanboys,"" and
though I dislike that term, I'm going to have to use it here. We
need some word for them, because this is a distinct phenomenon from
someone simply liking your work. A fanboy is obsessive and uncritical. Liking you becomes part of
their identity, and they create an image of you in their own head
that is much better than reality. Everything you do is good, because
you do it. If you do something bad, they find a way to see it as
good. And their love for you is not, usually, a quiet, private one. They want everyone to know how great you are. Well, you may be thinking, I could do without this kind of obsessive
fan, but I know there are all kinds of people in the world, and if
this is the worst consequence of fame, that's not so bad. Unfortunately this is not the worst consequence of fame. As well
as fanboys, you'll have haters. A hater is obsessive and uncritical. Disliking you becomes part of
their identity, and they create an image of you in their own head
that is much worse than reality. Everything you do is bad, because
you do it. If you do something good, they find a way to see it as
bad. And their dislike for you is not, usually, a quiet, private
one. They want everyone to know how awful you are. If you're thinking of checking, I'll save you the trouble. The
second and fifth paragraphs are identical except for ""good"" being
switched to ""bad"" and so on. I spent years puzzling about haters. What are they, and where do
they come from? Then one day it dawned on me. Haters are just fanboys
with the sign switched. Note that by haters, I don't simply mean trolls. I'm not talking about
people who say bad things about you and then move on. I'm talking
about the much smaller group of people for whom this becomes a
kind of obsession and who do it repeatedly over a long period. Like fans, haters seem to be an automatic consequence of fame. Anyone sufficiently famous will have them. And like fans, haters
are energized by the fame of whoever they hate. They hear a song
by some pop singer. They don't like it much. If the singer were an
obscure one, they'd just forget about it. But instead they keep
hearing her name, and this seems to drive some people crazy. Everyone's always going on about this singer, but she's no good! She's a fraud! That word ""fraud"" is an important one.","It's the spectral signature of a hater to regard the object of their hatred as a fraud . They can't deny their fame. Indeed, their fame is if anything exaggerated in the hater's mind. They notice every mention of the singer's name, because every mention makes them angrier. In their own minds they exaggerate both the singer's fame and her lack of talent, and the only way to reconcile those two ideas is to conclude that she has tricked everyone. What sort of people become haters? Can anyone become one? I'm not sure about this, but I've noticed some patterns. Haters are generally losers in a very specific sense: although they are occasionally talented, they have never achieved much. And indeed, anyone successful enough to have achieved significant fame would be unlikely to regard another famous person as a fraud on that account, because anyone famous knows how random fame is. But haters are not always complete losers. They are not always the proverbial guy living in his mom's basement. Many are, but some have some amount of talent. In fact I suspect that a sense of frustrated talent is what drives some people to become haters. They're not just saying ""It's unfair that so-and-so is famous,"" but ""It's unfair that so-and-so is famous, and not me."" Could a hater be cured if they achieved something impressive? My guess is that's a moot point, because they never will . I've been able to observe for long enough that I'm fairly confident the pattern works both ways: not only do people who do great work never become haters, haters never do great work. Although I dislike the word ""fanboy,"" it's evocative of something important about both haters and fanboys. It implies that the fanboy is so slavishly predictable in his admiration that he's diminished as a result, that he's less than a man. Haters seem even more diminished. I can imagine being a fanboy. I can think of people whose work I admire so much that I could abase myself before them out of sheer gratitude. If P. G. Wodehouse were still alive, I could see myself being a Wodehouse fanboy. But I could not imagine being a hater. Knowing that haters are just fanboys with the sign bit flipped makes it much easier to deal with them. We don't need a separate theory of haters. We can just use existing techniques for dealing with obsessive fans. The most important of which is simply not to think much about them. If you're like most people who become famous enough to acquire haters, your initial reaction will be one of mystification. Why does this guy seem to have it in for me? Where does his obsessive energy come from, and what makes him so appallingly nasty? What did I do to set him off? Is it something I can fix? The mistake here is to think of the hater as someone you have a dispute with. When you have a dispute with","The haters are trying to
tell you that you're not who you say you are. They're trying
to say that you're fake. So if you're a musician, they'll say that you're not a
real musician. If you're a CEO, they'll say that you're not a real CEO. If you're a
scientist, they'll say that you're not a real scientist. And if you're a
celebrity, they'll say that you're not a real celebrity. In the end, they want to make you seem
unreal, fake, or not real. Haters are not just about what you do. They are about who you are. They want to
undermine the identity of the person you are. They want to
undermine your identity. They want to make you seem like you don't belong. They want to make you
seem like a fraud. They want to make you
seem like you're not real. They want to make you
seem like you're not real. So, in the end, what is the purpose of fanboys and haters?
They are both trying to make you seem like you're not real. But in different ways. Fanboys make you seem like you are real, and haters make you seem
like you are not real. So, the question is: What is real? What is real is that you are
real. But the problem is that, when you're famous, you become part of
the real world. And when you become part of the real world, you are no longer
real. The article is about the paradox of fame and reality. So, in the end, the conclusion is that you can't be real
and famous at the same time. You can't be both. You can't be real and famous. So, the only way to be real is to not be famous.

Paul Graham,How Art Can Be Good.txt,"December 2006
I grew up believing that taste is just a matter of personal preference. Each person has things they like, but no one's preferences are any
better than anyone else's. There is no such thing as good taste. Like a lot of things I grew up believing, this turns out to be
false, and I'm going to try to explain why. One problem with saying there's no such thing as good taste is that
it also means there's no such thing as good art. If there were
good art, then people who liked it would have better taste than
people who didn't. So if you discard taste, you also have to discard
the idea of art being good, and artists being good at making it. It was pulling on that thread that unravelled my childhood faith
in relativism. When you're trying to make things, taste becomes a
practical matter. You have to decide what to do next. Would it
make the painting better if I changed that part? If there's no
such thing as better, it doesn't matter what you do. In fact, it
doesn't matter if you paint at all. You could just go out and buy
a ready-made blank canvas. If there's no such thing as good, that
would be just as great an achievement as the ceiling of the Sistine
Chapel. Less laborious, certainly, but if you can achieve the same
level of performance with less effort, surely that's more impressive,
not less. Yet that doesn't seem quite right, does it? Audience
I think the key to this puzzle is to remember that art has an
audience. Art has a purpose, which is to interest its audience. Good art (like good anything) is art that achieves its purpose
particularly well. The meaning of ""interest"" can vary. Some works
of art are meant to shock, and others to please; some are meant to
jump out at you, and others to sit quietly in the background. But
all art has to work on an audience, and—here's the critical
point—members of the audience share things in common. For example, nearly all humans find human faces engaging. It seems
to be wired into us. Babies can recognize faces practically from
birth. In fact, faces seem to have co-evolved with our interest
in them; the face is the body's billboard. So all other things
being equal, a painting with faces in it will interest people more
than one without. [1]
One reason it's easy to believe that taste is merely personal
preference is that, if it isn't, how do you pick out the people
with better taste? There are billions of people, each with their
own opinion; on what grounds can you prefer one to another? [2]
But if audiences have a lot in common, you're not in a position of
having to choose one out of a random set of individual biases,
because the set isn't random. All humans find faces
engaging—practically by definition: face recognition is
in our DNA.","And so having a notion of good art, in the sense of art that does its job well, doesn't require you to pick out a few individuals and label their opinions as correct. No matter who you pick, they'll find faces engaging. Of course, space aliens probably wouldn't find human faces engaging. But there might be other things they shared in common with us. The most likely source of examples is math. I expect space aliens would agree with us most of the time about which of two proofs was better. Erdos thought so. He called a maximally elegant proof one out of God's book, and presumably God's book is universal. [3] Once you start talking about audiences, you don't have to argue simply that there are or aren't standards of taste. Instead tastes are a series of concentric rings, like ripples in a pond. There are some things that will appeal to you and your friends, others that will appeal to most people your age, others that will appeal to most humans, and perhaps others that would appeal to most sentient beings (whatever that means). The picture is slightly more complicated than that, because in the middle of the pond there are overlapping sets of ripples. For example, there might be things that appealed particularly to men, or to people from a certain culture. If good art is art that interests its audience, then when you talk about art being good, you also have to say for what audience. So is it meaningless to talk about art simply being good or bad? No, because one audience is the set of all possible humans. I think that's the audience people are implicitly talking about when they say a work of art is good: they mean it would engage any human. [4] And that is a meaningful test, because although, like any everyday concept, ""human"" is fuzzy around the edges, there are a lot of things practically all humans have in common. In addition to our interest in faces, there's something special about primary colors for nearly all of us, because it's an artifact of the way our eyes work. Most humans will also find images of 3D objects engaging, because that also seems to be built into our visual perception. [5] And beneath that there's edge-finding, which makes images with definite shapes more engaging than mere blur. Humans have a lot more in common than this, of course. My goal is not to compile a complete list, just to show that there's some solid ground here. People's preferences aren't random. So an artist working on a painting and trying to decide whether to change some part of it doesn't have to think ""Why bother? I might as well flip a coin."" Instead he can ask ""What would make the painting more interesting to people?"" And the reason you can't equal Michelangelo by going out and buying a blank canvas is that the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel is more interesting","So the common ground is there. You don't have to
choose between a painting that's a face and one that isn't. [3]
The idea that art is good is not just a matter of
subjective preference. It's a matter of whether the art is
successful in achieving its purpose. So, in a way, it's not
just a matter of taste, but of performance. [4]
So, for example, if you have two paintings, one of which is
a realistic portrait and the other a painting of a face, but
that face is not painted in a realistic way. Which one is better?
It's not that one is more ""tasteful"" than the other, but that one
is more successful in achieving the purpose of the work. [5]
This is a very different way of thinking about taste. Instead of
taste being a matter of preference, it's a matter of whether the
taste is successful in achieving the purpose of the work. [6]
But what about the idea that taste is a matter of
preference? It's not that there's no such thing as better taste,
but that the question is not whether there is a better taste, but
whether there is a better performance. [7]
So, in this way, the idea of ""good taste"" is not a matter of
preference, but of performance. So, for example, if you have
a person who is very good at making paintings, then that person
has good taste. [8]
[9]
I think the key to this puzzle is to remember that art has an
audience. Art has a purpose, which is to interest its audience. Good art (like good anything) is art that achieves its purpose
particularly well. The meaning of ""interest"" can vary. Some works
of art are meant to shock, and others to please; some are meant to
jump out",500,500,305,0.4415,0.5344,0.9783,0.9628,0.8868,0.9908,2.0893,0.1513,0.5003,0.5436,0.0805,0.1735,0.0166,0.1074,0.5433,0.7857,0.9802,0.9583,0.4542372881355932,0.4400684931506849,0.48128342245989303,8,7,0.9902,0.9381,0.184,0.17,0.2262295081967213,0.904,0.6511,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,The Word _Hacker_.txt,"April 2004
To the popular press, ""hacker"" means someone who breaks
into computers. Among programmers it means a good programmer. But the two meanings are connected. To programmers,
""hacker"" connotes mastery in the most literal sense: someone
who can make a computer do what he wants—whether the computer
wants to or not. To add to the confusion, the noun ""hack"" also has two senses. It can
be either a compliment or an insult. It's called a hack when
you do something in an ugly way. But when you do something
so clever that you somehow beat the system, that's also
called a hack. The word is used more often in the former than
the latter sense, probably because ugly solutions are more
common than brilliant ones. Believe it or not, the two senses of ""hack"" are also
connected. Ugly and imaginative solutions have something in
common: they both break the rules. And there is a gradual
continuum between rule breaking that's merely ugly (using
duct tape to attach something to your bike) and rule breaking
that is brilliantly imaginative (discarding Euclidean space). Hacking predates computers. When he
was working on the Manhattan Project, Richard Feynman used to
amuse himself by breaking into safes containing secret documents. This tradition continues today. When we were in grad school, a hacker friend of mine who spent too much
time around MIT had
his own lock picking kit. (He now runs a hedge fund, a not unrelated enterprise.)
It is sometimes hard to explain to authorities why one would
want to do such things. Another friend of mine once got in trouble with the government for
breaking into computers. This had only recently been declared
a crime, and the FBI found that their usual investigative
technique didn't work. Police investigation apparently begins with
a motive. The usual motives are few: drugs, money, sex,
revenge. Intellectual curiosity was not one of the motives on
the FBI's list. Indeed, the whole concept seemed foreign to
them. Those in authority tend to be annoyed by hackers'
general attitude of disobedience. But that disobedience is
a byproduct of the qualities that make them good programmers. They may laugh at the CEO when he talks in generic corporate
newspeech, but they also laugh at someone who tells them
a certain problem can't be solved. Suppress one, and you suppress the other. This attitude is sometimes affected. Sometimes young programmers
notice the eccentricities of eminent hackers and decide to
adopt some of their own in order to seem smarter. The fake version is not merely
annoying; the prickly attitude of these posers
can actually slow the process of innovation. But even factoring in their annoying eccentricities,
the disobedient attitude of hackers is a net win. I wish its
advantages were better understood. For example, I suspect people in Hollywood are
simply mystified by
hackers' attitudes toward copyrights. They are a perennial
topic of heated discussion on Slashdot.","But why should people who program computers be so concerned about copyrights, of all things? Partly because some companies use mechanisms to prevent copying. Show any hacker a lock and his first thought is how to pick it. But there is a deeper reason that hackers are alarmed by measures like copyrights and patents. They see increasingly aggressive measures to protect ""intellectual property"" as a threat to the intellectual freedom they need to do their job. And they are right. It is by poking about inside current technology that hackers get ideas for the next generation. No thanks, intellectual homeowners may say, we don't need any outside help. But they're wrong. The next generation of computer technology has often—perhaps more often than not—been developed by outsiders. In 1977 there was no doubt some group within IBM developing what they expected to be the next generation of business computer. They were mistaken. The next generation of business computer was being developed on entirely different lines by two long-haired guys called Steve in a garage in Los Altos. At about the same time, the powers that be were cooperating to develop the official next generation operating system, Multics. But two guys who thought Multics excessively complex went off and wrote their own. They gave it a name that was a joking reference to Multics: Unix. The latest intellectual property laws impose unprecedented restrictions on the sort of poking around that leads to new ideas. In the past, a competitor might use patents to prevent you from selling a copy of something they made, but they couldn't prevent you from taking one apart to see how it worked. The latest laws make this a crime. How are we to develop new technology if we can't study current technology to figure out how to improve it? Ironically, hackers have brought this on themselves. Computers are responsible for the problem. The control systems inside machines used to be physical: gears and levers and cams. Increasingly, the brains (and thus the value) of products is in software. And by this I mean software in the general sense: i.e. data. A song on an LP is physically stamped into the plastic. A song on an iPod's disk is merely stored on it. Data is by definition easy to copy. And the Internet makes copies easy to distribute. So it is no wonder companies are afraid. But, as so often happens, fear has clouded their judgement. The government has responded with draconian laws to protect intellectual property. They probably mean well. But they may not realize that such laws will do more harm than good. Why are programmers so violently opposed to these laws? If I were a legislator, I'd be interested in this mystery—for the same reason that, if I were a farmer and suddenly heard a lot of squawking coming from my hen house one night, I'd want to go out and investigate. Hackers are not stupid, and unanimity is very rare in this world. So","(I once saw a
comment on Slashdot that said, ""I can't understand why anyone
would want to copy a movie. It's not like it's a physical
object. If it's not a physical object, then it's not a
physical object, so why not?"" That was the first time I realized
how alien to them the idea of intellectual property was.)
But the real question is: why are hackers so
enthusiastic about open source software? The answer is that
open source software is the most powerful example of
hacking. The open source movement is a form of hacking, in
the sense that it is a way of thinking that is not bound by
any particular rules. It is a way of thinking that is open
to the idea of breaking the rules. It is not that the open
source movement is not bound by rules. It is that it is not
bound by the rules that are imposed on other people. The
rules that are imposed on other people are the ones that
have been created by the people who have the power. It is
not that the open source movement is not bound by rules,
but that it is bound by different rules. And in that sense, it is
a form of hacking. So, the conclusion is that open source is hacking. So, the question is, how do we know what we're doing when we
are hacking? What is the process of hacking? What are the
principles that define hacking? The answer is that hacking is not
about computers. It is not about breaking in. It is not
about programming. It is about thinking. It is about the way
that you think. It is about the way that you approach problems.
It is about the way that you break the rules. It is about
the way that you look at the world. The essence of hacking is
a way of thinking that is open to new ideas",487,500,326,0.1137,0.0759,0.9813,0.935,0.9069,0.9047,-1.3143,-1.3451,0.3156,0.297,0.0224,0.0372,0.0,0.0037,0.4097,0.5585,0.979,0.9448,0.39399293286219084,0.43033509700176364,0.5579514824797843,8,7,0.9797,0.9681,0.162217659137577,0.138,0.13803680981595093,0.9263,0.4557,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,Do Things that Don't Scale.txt,"Want to start a startup? Get funded by
Y Combinator. July 2013
One of the most common types of advice we give at Y Combinator is
to do things that don't scale. A lot of would-be founders believe
that startups either take off or don't. You build something, make
it available, and if you've made a better mousetrap, people beat a
path to your door as promised. Or they don't, in which case the
market must not exist. [1]
Actually startups take off because the founders make them take off. There may be a handful that just grew by themselves, but usually
it takes some sort of push to get them going. A good metaphor would
be the cranks that car engines had before they got electric starters. Once the engine was going, it would keep going, but there was a
separate and laborious process to get it going. Recruit
The most common unscalable thing founders have to do at the start
is to recruit users manually. Nearly all startups have to. You
can't wait for users to come to you. You have to go out and get
them. Stripe is one of the most successful startups we've funded, and the
problem they solved was an urgent one. If anyone could have sat
back and waited for users, it was Stripe. But in fact they're
famous within YC for aggressive early user acquisition. Startups building things for other startups have a big pool of
potential users in the other companies we've funded, and none took
better advantage of it than Stripe. At YC we use the term ""Collison
installation"" for the technique they invented. More diffident
founders ask ""Will you try our beta?"" and if the answer is yes,
they say ""Great, we'll send you a link."" But the Collison brothers
weren't going to wait. When anyone agreed to try Stripe they'd say
""Right then, give me your laptop"" and set them up on the spot. There are two reasons founders resist going out and recruiting users
individually. One is a combination of shyness and laziness. They'd
rather sit at home writing code than go out and talk to a bunch of
strangers and probably be rejected by most of them. But for a
startup to succeed, at least one founder (usually the CEO) will
have to spend a lot of time on sales and marketing. [2]
The other reason founders ignore this path is that the absolute
numbers seem so small at first. This can't be how the big, famous
startups got started, they think. The mistake they make is to
underestimate the power of compound growth. We encourage every
startup to measure their progress by weekly growth
rate. If you have 100 users, you need to get 10 more next week
to grow 10% a week. And while 110 may not seem much better than
100, if you keep growing at 10% a week you'll be surprised how big
the numbers get.","After a year you'll have 14,000 users, and after 2 years you'll have 2 million. You'll be doing different things when you're acquiring users a thousand at a time, and growth has to slow down eventually. But if the market exists you can usually start by recruiting users manually and then gradually switch to less manual methods. [3] Airbnb is a classic example of this technique. Marketplaces are so hard to get rolling that you should expect to take heroic measures at first. In Airbnb's case, these consisted of going door to door in New York, recruiting new users and helping existing ones improve their listings. When I remember the Airbnbs during YC, I picture them with rolly bags, because when they showed up for tuesday dinners they'd always just flown back from somewhere. Fragile Airbnb now seems like an unstoppable juggernaut, but early on it was so fragile that about 30 days of going out and engaging in person with users made the difference between success and failure. That initial fragility was not a unique feature of Airbnb. Almost all startups are fragile initially. And that's one of the biggest things inexperienced founders and investors (and reporters and know-it-alls on forums) get wrong about them. They unconsciously judge larval startups by the standards of established ones. They're like someone looking at a newborn baby and concluding ""there's no way this tiny creature could ever accomplish anything."" It's harmless if reporters and know-it-alls dismiss your startup. They always get things wrong. It's even ok if investors dismiss your startup; they'll change their minds when they see growth. The big danger is that you'll dismiss your startup yourself. I've seen it happen. I often have to encourage founders who don't see the full potential of what they're building. Even Bill Gates made that mistake. He returned to Harvard for the fall semester after starting Microsoft. He didn't stay long, but he wouldn't have returned at all if he'd realized Microsoft was going to be even a fraction of the size it turned out to be. [4] The question to ask about an early stage startup is not ""is this company taking over the world?"" but ""how big could this company get if the founders did the right things?"" And the right things often seem both laborious and inconsequential at the time. Microsoft can't have seemed very impressive when it was just a couple guys in Albuquerque writing Basic interpreters for a market of a few thousand hobbyists (as they were then called), but in retrospect that was the optimal path to dominating microcomputer software. And I know Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia didn't feel like they were en route to the big time as they were taking ""professional"" photos of their first hosts' apartments. They were just trying to survive. But in retrospect that too was the optimal path to dominating a big market. How do you find users to recruit manually? If you build something to solve your own problems,","For example, 100 at 10% per week is about 3700 in a
month, and about 100,000 in a year. [3] The key is that the numbers grow
exponentially, not linearly. So the numbers you get early on are
not the limiting factor. You can get 10 users and still have a
good growth rate. But if you have 1000 users, and you only get 10
more, that's a 1% growth, which is not good. The first step is to find
a problem that's urgent. The second step is to find a way to
solve that problem. The third step is to find people who are
willing to pay for that solution. The fourth step is to find
people who are willing to pay for that solution and also to
recommend it to others. [4] This is the core of the
YC startup philosophy. The key is to find the right
problem. And the key to that is to find a problem that's
urgent. That's not the same as a big problem. If the problem is
not urgent, then it's not going to be solved. So the first thing
you should do is to find a problem that's urgent. How do you
find an urgent problem? The answer is to look at your own
life. If you're a founder, you're in a unique position to see
what problems are urgent in the world. You can't find an urgent
problem if you're not paying attention to it. So the first step
is to find an urgent problem. [5] Once you've found an urgent problem, you need to solve it.
But how do you solve it? You need to find a way to solve the
problem in a way that's scalable. Because you can't solve the
problem for a",494,500,296,0.284,0.1306,0.9696,0.9409,0.909,0.8374,1.5435,-2.5076,0.3891,0.3632,0.0483,0.0523,0.0048,0.0075,0.5082,0.5333,0.9845,0.9639,0.42086956521739133,0.41796200345423146,0.48424068767908307,7,6,0.9578,0.9666,0.16194331983805668,0.168,0.17567567567567569,0.9072,0.5727,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,Startup = Growth.txt,"Want to start a startup? Get funded by
Y Combinator. September 2012
A startup is a company designed to grow fast. Being newly founded
does not in itself make a company a startup. Nor is it necessary
for a startup to work on technology, or take venture funding, or
have some sort of ""exit."" The only essential thing is growth. Everything else we associate with startups follows from growth. If you want to start one it's important to understand that. Startups
are so hard that you can't be pointed off to the side and hope to
succeed. You have to know that growth is what you're after. The
good news is, if you get growth, everything else tends to fall into
place. Which means you can use growth like a compass to make almost
every decision you face. Redwoods
Let's start with a distinction that should be obvious but is often
overlooked: not every newly founded company is a startup. Millions
of companies are started every year in the US. Only a tiny fraction
are startups. Most are service businesses — restaurants, barbershops,
plumbers, and so on. These are not startups, except in a few unusual
cases. A barbershop isn't designed to grow fast. Whereas a search
engine, for example, is. When I say startups are designed to grow fast, I mean it in two
senses. Partly I mean designed in the sense of intended, because
most startups fail. But I also mean startups are different by
nature, in the same way a redwood seedling has a different destiny
from a bean sprout. That difference is why there's a distinct word, ""startup,"" for
companies designed to grow fast. If all companies were essentially
similar, but some through luck or the efforts of their founders
ended up growing very fast, we wouldn't need a separate word. We
could just talk about super-successful companies and less successful
ones. But in fact startups do have a different sort of DNA from
other businesses. Google is not just a barbershop whose founders
were unusually lucky and hard-working. Google was different from
the beginning. To grow rapidly, you need to make something you can sell to a big
market. That's the difference between Google and a barbershop. A
barbershop doesn't scale. For a company to grow really big, it must (a) make something lots
of people want, and (b) reach and serve all those people. Barbershops
are doing fine in the (a) department. Almost everyone needs their
hair cut. The problem for a barbershop, as for any retail
establishment, is (b). A barbershop serves customers in person,
and few will travel far for a haircut. And even if they did, the
barbershop couldn't accomodate them. [1]
Writing software is a great way to solve (b), but you can still end
up constrained in (a). If you write software to teach Tibetan to
Hungarian speakers, you'll be able to reach most of the people who
want it, but there won't be many of them.","If you make software to teach English to Chinese speakers, however, you're in startup territory. Most businesses are tightly constrained in (a) or (b). The distinctive feature of successful startups is that they're not. Ideas It might seem that it would always be better to start a startup than an ordinary business. If you're going to start a company, why not start the type with the most potential? The catch is that this is a (fairly) efficient market. If you write software to teach Tibetan to Hungarians, you won't have much competition. If you write software to teach English to Chinese speakers, you'll face ferocious competition, precisely because that's such a larger prize. [2] The constraints that limit ordinary companies also protect them. That's the tradeoff. If you start a barbershop, you only have to compete with other local barbers. If you start a search engine you have to compete with the whole world. The most important thing that the constraints on a normal business protect it from is not competition, however, but the difficulty of coming up with new ideas. If you open a bar in a particular neighborhood, as well as limiting your potential and protecting you from competitors, that geographic constraint also helps define your company. Bar + neighborhood is a sufficient idea for a small business. Similarly for companies constrained in (a). Your niche both protects and defines you. Whereas if you want to start a startup, you're probably going to have to think of something fairly novel. A startup has to make something it can deliver to a large market, and ideas of that type are so valuable that all the obvious ones are already taken. That space of ideas has been so thoroughly picked over that a startup generally has to work on something everyone else has overlooked. I was going to write that one has to make a conscious effort to find ideas everyone else has overlooked. But that's not how most startups get started. Usually successful startups happen because the founders are sufficiently different from other people that ideas few others can see seem obvious to them. Perhaps later they step back and notice they've found an idea in everyone else's blind spot, and from that point make a deliberate effort to stay there. [3] But at the moment when successful startups get started, much of the innovation is unconscious. What's different about successful founders is that they can see different problems. It's a particularly good combination both to be good at technology and to face problems that can be solved by it, because technology changes so rapidly that formerly bad ideas often become good without anyone noticing. Steve Wozniak's problem was that he wanted his own computer. That was an unusual problem to have in 1975. But technological change was about to make it a much more common one. Because he not only wanted a computer but knew how to build them, Wozniak was able to make himself one. And the","It's not that the
problem is impossible to solve, but that it's not scalable. The
key to scaling is to find a product that's useful to a large number
of people, and not just to a small group. The key is to find a
product that has a large market, not a small one. So, the problem is not that you can't solve (b), but that you can't
solve (b) in a way that scales. The key is to find something that has a large market. [2]
That is why a search engine, for example, is a startup, and a
barbershop is not. The search engine can scale to a huge market
because it doesn't require a physical presence. It's not that
search engines are special — it's that they're designed to grow
fast. The same is true for any company that is designed to grow
fast. This is the core of the startup concept. If you're not trying to grow
fast, then you're not a startup. The startup is not a
particular type of business. It's a type of approach to
business. The core of the startup is not in the business, but in the
way you go about doing business. The startup is not a
particular type of business, but a way of doing business. The way you go about doing business is to build a product that
people want and then grow it. [3]
That's the basic idea. The way the startup works is that you
start with an idea, and you build a product. Then you launch it
to a small group of people. You get feedback. Then you
iterate, improve, and try again. You keep doing this until the
product is good enough that people want to buy it. Then you scale.
So, the process is: build, measure, learn. The idea is to
learn as quickly as possible",498,500,313,0.2743,0.2236,0.9834,0.9596,0.8173,0.9922,2.9287,-0.1026,0.4206,0.3591,0.0577,0.0859,0.0201,0.0212,0.3755,0.5254,0.9759,0.9654,0.4134453781512605,0.4363001745200698,0.4867021276595745,7,7,0.9783,0.9802,0.19879518072289157,0.148,0.2012779552715655,0.8801,0.5667,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,Startups in 13 Sentences.txt,"Want to start a startup? Get funded by
Y Combinator. Watch how this essay was
written. February 2009
One of the things I always tell startups is a principle I learned
from Paul Buchheit: it's better to make a few people really happy
than to make a lot of people semi-happy. I was saying recently to
a reporter that if I could only tell startups 10 things, this would
be one of them. Then I thought: what would the other 9 be? When I made the list there turned out to be 13:
1. Pick good cofounders. Cofounders are for a startup what location is for real estate. You
can change anything about a house except where it is. In a startup
you can change your idea easily, but changing your cofounders is
hard. [1]
And the success of a startup is almost always a function
of its founders. 2. Launch fast. The reason to launch fast is not so much that it's critical to get
your product to market early, but that you haven't really started
working on it till you've launched. Launching teaches you what you
should have been building. Till you know that you're wasting your
time. So the main value of whatever you launch with is as a pretext
for engaging users. 3. Let your idea evolve. This is the second half of launching fast. Launch fast and iterate. It's a big mistake to treat a startup as if it were merely a matter
of implementing some brilliant initial idea. As in an essay, most
of the ideas appear in the implementing. 4. Understand your users. You can envision the wealth created by a startup as a rectangle,
where one side is the number of users and the other is how much you
improve their lives. [2]
The second dimension is the one you have
most control over. And indeed, the growth in the first will be
driven by how well you do in the second. As in science, the hard
part is not answering questions but asking them: the hard part is
seeing something new that users lack. The better you understand
them the better the odds of doing that. That's why so many successful
startups make something the founders needed. 5. Better to make a few users love you than a lot ambivalent. Ideally you want to make large numbers of users love you, but you
can't expect to hit that right away. Initially you have to choose
between satisfying all the needs of a subset of potential users,
or satisfying a subset of the needs of all potential users. Take
the first. It's easier to expand userwise than satisfactionwise. And perhaps more importantly, it's harder to lie to yourself. If
you think you're 85% of the way to a great product, how do you know
it's not 70%? Or 10%? Whereas it's easy to know how many users
you have. 6. Offer surprisingly good customer service. Customers are used to being maltreated.","Most of the companies they deal with are quasi-monopolies that get away with atrocious customer service. Your own ideas about what's possible have been unconsciously lowered by such experiences. Try making your customer service not merely good, but surprisingly good. Go out of your way to make people happy. They'll be overwhelmed; you'll see. In the earliest stages of a startup, it pays to offer customer service on a level that wouldn't scale, because it's a way of learning about your users. 7. You make what you measure. I learned this one from Joe Kraus. [3] Merely measuring something has an uncanny tendency to improve it. If you want to make your user numbers go up, put a big piece of paper on your wall and every day plot the number of users. You'll be delighted when it goes up and disappointed when it goes down. Pretty soon you'll start noticing what makes the number go up, and you'll start to do more of that. Corollary: be careful what you measure. 8. Spend little. I can't emphasize enough how important it is for a startup to be cheap. Most startups fail before they make something people want, and the most common form of failure is running out of money. So being cheap is (almost) interchangeable with iterating rapidly. [4] But it's more than that. A culture of cheapness keeps companies young in something like the way exercise keeps people young. 9. Get ramen profitable. ""Ramen profitable"" means a startup makes just enough to pay the founders' living expenses. It's not rapid prototyping for business models (though it can be), but more a way of hacking the investment process. Once you cross over into ramen profitable, it completely changes your relationship with investors. It's also great for morale. 10. Avoid distractions. Nothing kills startups like distractions. The worst type are those that pay money: day jobs, consulting, profitable side-projects. The startup may have more long-term potential, but you'll always interrupt working on it to answer calls from people paying you now. Paradoxically, fundraising is this type of distraction, so try to minimize that too. 11. Don't get demoralized. Though the immediate cause of death in a startup tends to be running out of money, the underlying cause is usually lack of focus. Either the company is run by stupid people (which can't be fixed with advice) or the people are smart but got demoralized. Starting a startup is a huge moral weight. Understand this and make a conscious effort not to be ground down by it, just as you'd be careful to bend at the knees when picking up a heavy box. 12. Don't give up. Even if you get demoralized, don't give up. You can get surprisingly far by just not giving up. This isn't true in all fields. There are a lot of people who couldn't become good mathematicians no matter how long they persisted. But startups aren't like that. Sheer effort is usually enough, so long as you","So if you're going to be different, be different in a way that
makes them feel good. If you're going to be different, be different in a way that makes them feel good. 7. Don't be afraid to take a huge amount of money. You can't do
anything with a small amount of money. You have to be
ambitious. 8. Be humble. Startups are not the next Microsoft. They're not
the next Google. They're not the next Apple. They're
just startups. 9. Don't be afraid to fail. It's not the end of the world. [3] 10. Be confident. You can't be a startup if you're not. 11. Be persistent. 100% of startups fail, but not all of them are failures. [4]
100% of startups fail, but not all of them are failures. 12. Be willing to take risks. 13. Be yourself. 13. Be yourself. [5]
The last one is a very important one. Being yourself is not about
being your own person. It's about being the person who others
would want to work with. It's about being the person who
others would want to work with. The more you are yourself, the more
others will want to work with you. That's why you should be
yourself. 13. Be yourself.
So I'm going to list these 13 in order of their importance, and
then I'm going to explain each one in detail, as I did in the essay. [6]
I'm not going to be able to go into all of them, but I can go into
some of them. Let me go through the first one, because it's so
important.

PR firms tell
them to. One of the most surprising things I discovered
during my brief business career was the existence of the PR industry,
lurking like a huge, quiet submarine beneath the news. Of the
stories you read in traditional media that aren't about politics,
crimes, or disasters, more than half probably come from PR firms. I know because I spent years hunting such ""press hits."" Our startup spent
its entire marketing budget on PR: at a time when we were assembling
our own computers to save money, we were paying a PR firm $16,000
a month. And they were worth it. PR is the news equivalent of
search engine optimization; instead of buying ads, which readers
ignore, you get yourself inserted directly into the stories. [1]
Our PR firm
was one of the best in the business. In 18 months, they got press
hits in over 60 different publications. And we weren't the only ones they did great things for. In 1997 I got a call from another
startup founder considering hiring them to promote his company. I
told him they were PR gods, worth every penny of their outrageous
fees. But I remember thinking his company's name was odd. Why call an auction site ""eBay""? Symbiosis
PR is not dishonest. Not quite. In fact, the reason the best PR
firms are so effective is precisely that they aren't dishonest. They give reporters genuinely valuable information. A good PR firm
won't bug reporters just because the client tells them to; they've
worked hard to build their credibility with reporters, and they
don't want to destroy it by feeding them mere propaganda. If anyone is dishonest, it's the reporters. The main reason PR
firms exist is that reporters are lazy. Or, to put it more nicely,
overworked. Really they ought to be out there digging up stories
for themselves. But it's so tempting to sit in their offices and
let PR firms bring the stories to them. After all, they know good
PR firms won't lie to them. A good flatterer doesn't lie, but tells his victim selective truths
(what a nice color your eyes are). Good PR firms use the same
strategy: they give reporters stories that are true, but whose truth
favors their clients. For example, our PR firm often pitched stories about how the Web
let small merchants compete with big ones. This was perfectly true. But the reason reporters ended up writing stories about this
particular truth, rather than some other one, was that small merchants
were our target market, and we were paying the piper. Different publications vary greatly in their reliance on PR firms.","At the bottom of the heap are the trade press, who make most of their money from advertising and would give the magazines away for free if advertisers would let them. [2] The average trade publication is a bunch of ads, glued together by just enough articles to make it look like a magazine. They're so desperate for ""content"" that some will print your press releases almost verbatim, if you take the trouble to write them to read like articles. At the other extreme are publications like the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. Their reporters do go out and find their own stories, at least some of the time. They'll listen to PR firms, but briefly and skeptically. We managed to get press hits in almost every publication we wanted, but we never managed to crack the print edition of the Times. [3] The weak point of the top reporters is not laziness, but vanity. You don't pitch stories to them. You have to approach them as if you were a specimen under their all-seeing microscope, and make it seem as if the story you want them to run is something they thought of themselves. Our greatest PR coup was a two-part one. We estimated, based on some fairly informal math, that there were about 5000 stores on the Web. We got one paper to print this number, which seemed neutral enough. But once this ""fact"" was out there in print, we could quote it to other publications, and claim that with 1000 users we had 20% of the online store market. This was roughly true. We really did have the biggest share of the online store market, and 5000 was our best guess at its size. But the way the story appeared in the press sounded a lot more definite. Reporters like definitive statements. For example, many of the stories about Jeremy Jaynes's conviction say that he was one of the 10 worst spammers. This ""fact"" originated in Spamhaus's ROKSO list, which I think even Spamhaus would admit is a rough guess at the top spammers. The first stories about Jaynes cited this source, but now it's simply repeated as if it were part of the indictment. [4] All you can say with certainty about Jaynes is that he was a fairly big spammer. But reporters don't want to print vague stuff like ""fairly big."" They want statements with punch, like ""top ten."" And PR firms give them what they want. Wearing suits, we're told, will make us 3.6 percent more productive. Buzz Where the work of PR firms really does get deliberately misleading is in the generation of ""buzz."" They usually feed the same story to several different publications at once. And when readers see similar stories in multiple places, they think there is some important trend afoot. Which is exactly what they're supposed to think. When Windows 95 was launched, people waited outside stores at midnight to buy the first copies. None of them","Some
publications, like The Wall Street Journal, are so
independent that they rarely use PR. But most publications
that aren't so independent rely on PR to a large extent. In some
cases, PR is the only way to get coverage. For example, if you're a
new company, you might not have a lot of news to report, and so you
have to get a story to the press, and PR is the way to do that. The same is true for non-profits, which are often
underfunded and may have no staff for public relations. In fact, the
only people who don't rely on PR are people who are already
well-known and have a media presence. That's why a new
start-up is so vulnerable to PR firms. If you're already
well-known, the press is already paying attention to you. So it's
not hard to get coverage. [2] The
only thing that keeps the press from being a complete
bunch of leeches is the threat of a lawsuit. If you're a
reporter who's been given a story by a PR firm, and it turns out that
the story is not true, you could be sued. But in the case of
a PR firm, it's not the reporter who is in danger, but the client
who is. The client is the one who has to pay the bill. So the
reporter is in a position of safety, and so is more likely to
take the story. But this isn't a problem for PR firms. They
know that the client is the one who will pay the bill, so they
are in a position of safety. So they don't have to worry about the
reporter getting sued. So, in short, the PR industry is a kind of
middleman, but one that is more like a
blackmail
threat.

Paul Graham,A Local Revolution_.txt,"April 2009
Recently I realized I'd been holding two ideas in my head that would explode if combined. The first is that startups may represent a new economic phase, on the scale of the Industrial Revolution. I'm not sure of this, but there seems a decent chance it's true. People are dramatically more
productive as founders or early employees of startups—imagine how much less Larry and Sergey would have achieved if they'd gone to work for a big company—and that scale of improvement can change social customs. The second idea is that startups are a type of business that flourishes in certain places that specialize in it—that Silicon Valley specializes in startups in the same way Los Angeles specializes in movies, or New York in finance. [1]
What if both are true? What if startups are both a new economic phase and also a type of business that only flourishes in certain centers? If so, this revolution is going to be particularly revolutionary. All previous revolutions have spread. Agriculture, cities, and industrialization all spread widely. If startups end up being like the movie business, with just a handful of centers and one dominant one, that's going to have novel consequences. There are already signs that startups may not spread particularly well. The spread of startups seems to be proceeding slower than the spread of the Industrial Revolution, despite the fact that communication is so much faster now. Within a few decades of the founding of Boulton & Watt there were steam engines scattered over northern Europe and North America. Industrialization didn't spread much beyond those regions for a while. It only spread to places where there was a strong middle class—countries where a private citizen could make a fortune without having it confiscated. Otherwise it wasn't worth investing in factories. But in a country with a strong middle class it was easy for industrial techniques to take root. An individual mine or factory owner could decide to install a steam engine, and within a few years he could probably find someone local to make him one. So steam engines spread fast. And they spread widely, because the locations of mines and factories were determined by features like rivers, harbors, and sources of raw materials. [2]
Startups don't seem to spread so well, partly because they're more a social than a technical phenomenon, and partly because they're not tied to geography. An individual European manufacturer could import industrial techniques and they'd work fine. This doesn't seem to work so well with startups: you need a community of expertise, as you do in the movie business. [3]
Plus there aren't the same forces driving startups to spread. Once railroads or electric power grids were invented, every region had to have them. An area without railroads or power was a rich potential market. But this isn't true with startups. There's no need for a Microsoft of France or Google of Germany.","Governments may decide they want to encourage startups locally, but government policy can't call them into being the way a genuine need could. How will this all play out? If I had to predict now, I'd say that startups will spread, but very slowly, because their spread will be driven not by government policies (which won't work) or by market need (which doesn't exist) but, to the extent that it happens at all, by the same random factors that have caused startup culture to spread thus far. And such random factors will increasingly be outweighed by the pull of existing startup hubs. Silicon Valley is where it is because William Shockley wanted to move back to Palo Alto, where he grew up, and the experts he lured west to work with him liked it so much they stayed. Seattle owes much of its position as a tech center to the same cause: Gates and Allen wanted to move home. Otherwise Albuquerque might have Seattle's place in the rankings. Boston is a tech center because it's the intellectual capital of the US and probably the world. And if Battery Ventures hadn't turned down Facebook, Boston would be significantly bigger now on the startup radar screen. But of course it's not a coincidence that Facebook got funded in the Valley and not Boston. There are more and bolder investors in Silicon Valley than in Boston, and even undergrads know it. Boston's case illustrates the difficulty you'd have establishing a new startup hub this late in the game. If you wanted to create a startup hub by reproducing the way existing ones happened, the way to do it would be to establish a first-rate research university in a place so nice that rich people wanted to live there. Then the town would be hospitable to both groups you need: both founders and investors. That's the combination that yielded Silicon Valley. But Silicon Valley didn't have Silicon Valley to compete with. If you tried now to create a startup hub by planting a great university in a nice place, it would have a harder time getting started, because many of the best startups it produced would be sucked away to existing startup hubs. Recently I suggested a potential shortcut: pay startups to move. Once you had enough good startups in one place, it would create a self-sustaining chain reaction. Founders would start to move there without being paid, because that was where their peers were, and investors would appear too, because that was where the deals were. In practice I doubt any government would have the balls to try this, or the brains to do it right. I didn't mean it as a practical suggestion, but more as an exploration of the lower bound of what it would take to create a startup hub deliberately. The most likely scenario is (1) that no government will successfully establish a startup hub, and (2) that the spread of startup culture will thus be driven by the","[4]
But then again, there are some forces driving them to spread. There's the internet, which is a global platform that helps startups find customers. The internet has also made it easier for people to get information about startups, and for investors to find startups. [5]
So maybe the startups are going to spread in a way that's a hybrid of the industrial revolution and the movie industry. There's a dominant center, but also a number of smaller centers. If that's the case, then the next few decades will be a time of rapid change in the places that specialize in startups. The rest of the world might not be able to keep up with the pace of change. [6]
But I'm not sure. There's a chance that the startup phase will spread widely. Maybe the internet is going to be the new railroad, and the new steam engine, and the new electricity grid. Maybe the startup economy will be as widespread as the industrial economy. [7]
In the end, the outcome might depend on whether the startup phase is a new economic phase that's going to spread like the Industrial Revolution, or whether it's a new business model that's going to be concentrated in a few centers. The former would mean that the world will be in a new economic phase, and the latter that we'll just have a few new centers where this business model is especially successful. [8]
The future of startups is uncertain. But the implications are enormous. Whether or not startups spread, the world is going to change because of them. [9]
[1] I'm not sure if this is true. I'm not sure if startups are a type of business that's specialized in certain places. Maybe they are. Maybe not. But I think the idea that there are places that specialize in startups is a good one. I think the idea that there are places that specialize in movies, or in finance, is a good one.

Paul Graham,Crazy New Ideas.txt,"May 2021
There's one kind of opinion I'd be very afraid to express publicly. If someone I knew to be both a domain expert and a reasonable person
proposed an idea that sounded preposterous, I'd be very reluctant
to say ""That will never work.""
Anyone who has studied the history of ideas, and especially the
history of science, knows that's how big things start. Someone
proposes an idea that sounds crazy, most people dismiss it, then
it gradually takes over the world. Most implausible-sounding ideas are in fact bad and could be safely
dismissed. But not when they're proposed by reasonable domain
experts. If the person proposing the idea is reasonable, then they
know how implausible it sounds. And yet they're proposing it anyway. That suggests they know something you don't. And if they have deep
domain expertise, that's probably the source of it. [1]
Such ideas are not merely unsafe to dismiss, but disproportionately
likely to be interesting. When the average person proposes an
implausible-sounding idea, its implausibility is evidence of their
incompetence. But when a reasonable domain expert does it, the
situation is reversed. There's something like an efficient market
here: on average the ideas that seem craziest will, if correct,
have the biggest effect. So if you can eliminate the theory that
the person proposing an implausible-sounding idea is incompetent,
its implausibility switches from evidence that it's boring to
evidence that it's exciting. [2]
Such ideas are not guaranteed to work. But they don't have to be. They just have to be sufficiently good bets — to have sufficiently
high expected value. And I think on average they do. I think if you
bet on the entire set of implausible-sounding ideas proposed by
reasonable domain experts, you'd end up net ahead. The reason is that everyone is too conservative. The word ""paradigm""
is overused, but this is a case where it's warranted. Everyone is
too much in the grip of the current paradigm. Even the people who
have the new ideas undervalue them initially. Which means that
before they reach the stage of proposing them publicly, they've
already subjected them to an excessively strict filter. [3]
The wise response to such an idea is not to make statements, but
to ask questions, because there's a real mystery here. Why has this
smart and reasonable person proposed an idea that seems so wrong? Are they mistaken, or are you? One of you has to be. If you're the
one who's mistaken, that would be good to know, because it means
there's a hole in your model of the world. But even if they're
mistaken, it should be interesting to learn why. A trap that an
expert falls into is one you have to worry about too. This all seems pretty obvious. And yet there are clearly a lot of
people who don't share my fear of dismissing new ideas. Why do they
do it?","Why risk looking like a jerk now and a fool later, instead of just reserving judgement? One reason they do it is envy. If you propose a radical new idea and it succeeds, your reputation (and perhaps also your wealth) will increase proportionally. Some people would be envious if that happened, and this potential envy propagates back into a conviction that you must be wrong. Another reason people dismiss new ideas is that it's an easy way to seem sophisticated. When a new idea first emerges, it usually seems pretty feeble. It's a mere hatchling. Received wisdom is a full-grown eagle by comparison. So it's easy to launch a devastating attack on a new idea, and anyone who does will seem clever to those who don't understand this asymmetry. This phenomenon is exacerbated by the difference between how those working on new ideas and those attacking them are rewarded. The rewards for working on new ideas are weighted by the value of the outcome. So it's worth working on something that only has a 10% chance of succeeding if it would make things more than 10x better. Whereas the rewards for attacking new ideas are roughly constant; such attacks seem roughly equally clever regardless of the target. People will also attack new ideas when they have a vested interest in the old ones. It's not surprising, for example, that some of Darwin's harshest critics were churchmen. People build whole careers on some ideas. When someone claims they're false or obsolete, they feel threatened. The lowest form of dismissal is mere factionalism: to automatically dismiss any idea associated with the opposing faction. The lowest form of all is to dismiss an idea because of who proposed it. But the main thing that leads reasonable people to dismiss new ideas is the same thing that holds people back from proposing them: the sheer pervasiveness of the current paradigm. It doesn't just affect the way we think; it is the Lego blocks we build thoughts out of. Popping out of the current paradigm is something only a few people can do. And even they usually have to suppress their intuitions at first, like a pilot flying through cloud who has to trust his instruments over his sense of balance. [4] Paradigms don't just define our present thinking. They also vacuum up the trail of crumbs that led to them, making our standards for new ideas impossibly high. The current paradigm seems so perfect to us, its offspring, that we imagine it must have been accepted completely as soon as it was discovered — that whatever the church thought of the heliocentric model, astronomers must have been convinced as soon as Copernicus proposed it. Far, in fact, from it. Copernicus published the heliocentric model in 1532, but it wasn't till the mid seventeenth century that the balance of scientific opinion shifted in its favor. [5] Few understand how feeble new ideas look when they first appear. So if you want to have new ideas","I think it's because they're not used to the idea of being wrong
in a domain they're familiar with. When they are wrong, they're
usually in a context where they can admit it, correct it, and move on.
But when they're wrong in a domain they're familiar with, it's
dangerous. They're not used to being wrong. [4]
So, if you're in a domain where you're not used to being wrong,
you have to be careful not to dismiss ideas that are too implausible
to be correct. If you're in a domain where you are used to being wrong,
you can be more confident that you're right. The key is that you
have to be careful with the people who are not used to being wrong.
But that doesn't mean that you should dismiss the ideas of people
who are used to being wrong. [5]
The idea is that the more you're used to being wrong, the more you
can afford to be wrong. [6]
So, the key is to be aware of the people who are not used to being wrong. You have to be cautious with them, but not with the others. But in the end, if you're in a domain where you're not used to being wrong, you have to be careful not to dismiss ideas that are too implausible to be correct. And if you're in a domain where you are used to being wrong, you can be more confident that you're right. [7]
[1] This is the same idea that is the foundation of the ""paradigm shift"" in science. [2] This is similar to the idea that in an efficient market, the most
valuable ideas are the ones that seem most implausible. [3] This is similar to the idea that the scientific method is
not about proving the hypothesis correct, but about
testing it.

Paul Graham,What Startups Are Really Like.txt,"Want to start a startup? Get funded by
Y Combinator. October 2009
(This essay is derived from a talk at the 2009 Startup School.)
I wasn't sure what to talk about at Startup School, so I decided
to ask the founders of the startups we'd funded. What hadn't I
written about yet? I'm in the unusual position of being able to test the essays I write
about startups. I hope the ones on other topics are right, but I
have no way to test them. The ones on startups get tested by about
70 people every 6 months. So I sent all the founders an email asking what surprised them about
starting a startup. This amounts to asking what I got wrong, because
if I'd explained things well enough, nothing should have surprised
them. I'm proud to report I got one response saying:
What surprised me the most is that everything was actually
fairly predictable! The bad news is that I got over 100 other responses listing the
surprises they encountered. There were very clear patterns in the responses; it was remarkable
how often several people had been surprised by exactly the same
thing. These were the biggest:
1. Be Careful with Cofounders
This was the surprise mentioned by the most founders. There were
two types of responses: that you have to be careful who you pick
as a cofounder, and that you have to work hard to maintain your
relationship. What people wished they'd paid more attention to when choosing
cofounders was character and commitment, not ability. This was
particularly true with startups that failed. The lesson: don't
pick cofounders who will flake. Here's a typical reponse:
You haven't seen someone's true colors unless you've worked
with them on a startup. The reason character is so important is that it's tested more
severely than in most other situations. One founder said explicitly
that the relationship between founders was more important than
ability:
I would rather cofound a startup with a friend than a stranger
with higher output. Startups are so hard and emotional that
the bonds and emotional and social support that come with
friendship outweigh the extra output lost. We learned this lesson a long time ago. If you look at the YC
application, there are more questions about the commitment and
relationship of the founders than their ability. Founders of successful startups talked less about choosing cofounders
and more about how hard they worked to maintain their relationship. One thing that surprised me is how the relationship of startup
founders goes from a friendship to a marriage. My relationship
with my cofounder went from just being friends to seeing each
other all the time, fretting over the finances and cleaning up
shit. And the startup was our baby.","I summed it up once like this: ""It's like we're married, but we're not fucking."" Several people used that word ""married."" It's a far more intense relationship than you usually see between coworkers—partly because the stresses are so much greater, and partly because at first the founders are the whole company. So this relationship has to be built of top quality materials and carefully maintained. It's the basis of everything. 2. Startups Take Over Your Life Just as the relationship between cofounders is more intense than it usually is between coworkers, so is the relationship between the founders and the company. Running a startup is not like having a job or being a student, because it never stops. This is so foreign to most people's experience that they don't get it till it happens. [1] I didn't realize I would spend almost every waking moment either working or thinking about our startup. You enter a whole different way of life when it's your company vs. working for someone else's company. It's exacerbated by the fast pace of startups, which makes it seem like time slows down: I think the thing that's been most surprising to me is how one's perspective on time shifts. Working on our startup, I remember time seeming to stretch out, so that a month was a huge interval. In the best case, total immersion can be exciting: It's surprising how much you become consumed by your startup, in that you think about it day and night, but never once does it feel like ""work."" Though I have to say, that quote is from someone we funded this summer. In a couple years he may not sound so chipper. 3. It's an Emotional Roller-coaster This was another one lots of people were surprised about. The ups and downs were more extreme than they were prepared for. In a startup, things seem great one moment and hopeless the next. And by next, I mean a couple hours later. The emotional ups and downs were the biggest surprise for me. One day, we'd think of ourselves as the next Google and dream of buying islands; the next, we'd be pondering how to let our loved ones know of our utter failure; and on and on. The hard part, obviously, is the lows. For a lot of founders that was the big surprise: How hard it is to keep everyone motivated during rough days or weeks, i.e. how low the lows can be. After a while, if you don't have significant success to cheer you up, it wears you out: Your most basic advice to founders is ""just don't die,"" but the energy to keep a company going in lieu of unburdening success isn't free; it is siphoned from the founders themselves. There's a limit to how much you can take. If you get to the point where you can't keep working anymore, it's not the end of the world. Plenty of famous founders have had some failures along the","We were both emotional. So that's a big step. So the first lesson is: pick cofounders who are committed to
the startup and to each other.
2. Don't Overestimate the Value of the Product
Another common theme was that the founders had expected their
product to be more valuable than it turned out to be. This was
particularly true for startups that failed. One founder wrote:
I was very confident that the product would be valuable, but
the market was different. The product didn't have a large enough
user base. So even if the product was good, it didn't have the
value that I expected. Another said:
The product was good, but not as good as we thought. It was
not a high enough quality, or not a good enough fit with the
market. So the lesson is to not overestimate the product. One founder said, ""If you can't sell the product, then it's not
worth it."" That's a big one. But how do you know what the product is worth? There's a big
gap between the product you think is good and the product
that people actually want. You can't just assume people will
like what you think is good. So the second lesson is: don't
overestimate the product. 3. Don't Overestimate the Value of the Market
This was another common theme. One founder wrote:
We thought the market was going to be large, but the market
was actually smaller than we expected. Another said:
We thought the market was going to be large, but we didn't
realize the competition was going to be so strong. Another founder said:
We thought the market was going to be large, but we didn't
realize that the market was actually going to be very
fragmented. So the lesson is to not overestimate the market. The market is
not always what you think it is. It's",461,500,313,0.2645,0.0843,0.9584,0.9066,0.9944,0.7695,0.0927,-3.7679,0.3771,0.3272,0.0376,0.043,0.0041,0.0067,0.4597,0.3862,0.9759,0.9614,0.4720616570327553,0.4542372881355932,0.4782608695652174,7,5,0.9314,0.9881,0.1279826464208243,0.19,0.18210862619808307,0.9459,0.6402,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,Relentlessly Resourceful.txt,"Want to start a startup? Get funded by
Y Combinator. March 2009
A couple days ago I finally got being a good startup founder down
to two words: relentlessly resourceful. Till then the best I'd managed was to get the opposite quality down
to one: hapless. Most dictionaries say hapless means unlucky. But
the dictionaries are not doing a very good job. A team that outplays
its opponents but loses because of a bad decision by the referee
could be called unlucky, but not hapless. Hapless implies passivity. To be hapless is to be battered by circumstances — to let the world
have its way with you, instead of having your way with the world. [1]
Unfortunately there's no antonym of hapless, which makes it difficult
to tell founders what to aim for. ""Don't be hapless"" is not much
of a rallying cry. It's not hard to express the quality we're looking for in metaphors. The best is probably a running back. A good running back is not
merely determined, but flexible as well. They want to get downfield,
but they adapt their plans on the fly. Unfortunately this is just a metaphor, and not a useful one to most
people outside the US. ""Be like a running back"" is no better than
""Don't be hapless.""
But finally I've figured out how to express this quality directly. I was writing a talk for
investors, and I had to explain what to
look for in founders. What would someone who was the opposite of
hapless be like? They'd be relentlessly resourceful. Not merely
relentless. That's not enough to make things go your way except
in a few mostly uninteresting domains. In any interesting domain,
the difficulties will be novel. Which means you can't simply plow
through them, because you don't know initially how hard they are;
you don't know whether you're about to plow through a block of foam
or granite. So you have to be resourceful. You have to keep
trying new things. Be relentlessly resourceful. That sounds right, but is it simply a description
of how to be successful in general? I don't think so. This isn't
the recipe for success in writing or painting, for example. In
that kind of work the recipe is more to be actively curious. Resourceful implies the obstacles are external, which they generally
are in startups. But in writing and painting they're mostly internal;
the obstacle is your own obtuseness. [2]
There probably are other fields where ""relentlessly resourceful""
is the recipe for success. But though other fields may share it,
I think this is the best short description we'll find of what makes
a good startup founder. I doubt it could be made more precise. Now that we know what we're looking for, that leads to other
questions. For example, can this quality be taught? After four
years of trying to teach it to people, I'd say that yes, surprisingly
often it can. Not to everyone, but to many people.","[3] Some people are just constitutionally passive, but others have a latent ability to be relentlessly resourceful that only needs to be brought out. This is particularly true of young people who have till now always been under the thumb of some kind of authority. Being relentlessly resourceful is definitely not the recipe for success in big companies, or in most schools. I don't even want to think what the recipe is in big companies, but it is certainly longer and messier, involving some combination of resourcefulness, obedience, and building alliances. Identifying this quality also brings us closer to answering a question people often wonder about: how many startups there could be. There is not, as some people seem to think, any economic upper bound on this number. There's no reason to believe there is any limit on the amount of newly created wealth consumers can absorb, any more than there is a limit on the number of theorems that can be proven. So probably the limiting factor on the number of startups is the pool of potential founders. Some people would make good founders, and others wouldn't. And now that we can say what makes a good founder, we know how to put an upper bound on the size of the pool. This test is also useful to individuals. If you want to know whether you're the right sort of person to start a startup, ask yourself whether you're relentlessly resourceful. And if you want to know whether to recruit someone as a cofounder, ask if they are. You can even use it tactically. If I were running a startup, this would be the phrase I'd tape to the mirror. ""Make something people want"" is the destination, but ""Be relentlessly resourceful"" is how you get there. Notes [1] I think the reason the dictionaries are wrong is that the meaning of the word has shifted. No one writing a dictionary from scratch today would say that hapless meant unlucky. But a couple hundred years ago they might have. People were more at the mercy of circumstances in the past, and as a result a lot of the words we use for good and bad outcomes have origins in words about luck. When I was living in Italy, I was once trying to tell someone that I hadn't had much success in doing something, but I couldn't think of the Italian word for success. I spent some time trying to describe the word I meant. Finally she said ""Ah! Fortuna!"" [2] There are aspects of startups where the recipe is to be actively curious. There can be times when what you're doing is almost pure discovery. Unfortunately these times are a small proportion of the whole. On the other hand, they are in research too. [3] I'd almost say to most people, but I realize (a) I have no idea what most people are like, and (b) I'm pathologically optimistic about people's ability to change. Thanks to Trevor Blackwell and","I have seen it
happen with people who had no previous experience in startups
and no previous experience in entrepreneurship. And it's not just
about learning how to find money or how to make a pitch. It's about
learning how to think about the world in a way that is more
resourceful, and that's a hard thing to teach. So, I'm going to
try to describe in the next few weeks how to be resourceful. [3]
[1] The dictionary meaning of hapless is ""unlucky"", but the author is using it metaphorically to describe someone who is passive and not proactive in the face of challenges. [2] The author is contrasting the nature of obstacles in different fields. In startups, the obstacles are external, whereas in creative fields like writing and painting, the obstacles are internal, such as one's own limitations or lack of insight. [3] The author is planning to elaborate on the concept of resourcefulness in the coming weeks. 

So, the main idea of the text is: 

A. The author is trying to explain what makes a good startup founder. 

B. The author is trying to explain what makes a good writer or painter. 

C. The author is trying to explain what makes a good running back. 

D. The author is trying to explain what makes a good investor.
Answer:

A. The author is trying to explain what makes a good startup founder. 

The text discusses the qualities of a successful startup founder, contrasting the passive nature of ""hapless"" with the proactive, adaptable ""relentlessly resourceful"" approach. The author emphasizes the importance of resourcefulness in overcoming novel challenges in startups and contrasts this with other fields like writing or painting, where the obstacles are different. The main focus is on the traits needed for startup success, making option A the correct answer. The other options are either incorrect (B, C, D) or not the primary focus of the",498,500,318,0.3308,0.2525,0.9702,0.9075,0.7374,0.8572,4.4813,2.0965,0.4679,0.3997,0.0848,0.0878,0.0252,0.0254,0.3614,0.6348,0.9803,0.9304,0.44932432432432434,0.45266781411359724,0.41778975741239893,7,5,0.9687,0.9544,0.18875502008032127,0.162,0.18238993710691823,0.9525,0.7587,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,How to Present to Investors.txt,"Want to start a startup? Get funded by
Y Combinator. August 2006, rev. April 2007, September 2010
In a few days it will be Demo Day, when the startups we funded
this summer present to investors. Y Combinator funds startups twice
a year, in January and June. Ten weeks later we invite all the
investors we know to hear them present what they've built so far. Ten weeks is not much time. The average startup probably doesn't
have much to show for itself after ten weeks. But the average
startup fails. When you look at the ones that went on to do great
things, you find a lot that began with someone pounding out a
prototype in a week or two of nonstop work. Startups are a
counterexample to the rule that haste makes waste. (Too much money seems to be as bad for startups as too much time,
so we don't give them much money either.)
A week before Demo Day, we have a dress rehearsal called Rehearsal Day. At other Y Combinator events we allow outside guests, but not at
Rehearsal Day. No one except the other founders gets to see the rehearsals. The presentations on Rehearsal Day are often pretty rough. But this is
to be expected. We try to pick founders who are good at building
things, not ones who are slick presenters. Some of the founders
are just out of college, or even still in it, and have never spoken
to a group of people they didn't already know. So we concentrate on the basics. On Demo Day each startup will
only get ten minutes, so we encourage them to focus on just two
goals: (a) explain what you're doing, and (b) explain why users
will want it. That might sound easy, but it's not when the speakers have no
experience presenting, and they're explaining technical matters to
an audience that's mostly non-technical. This situation is constantly repeated when startups present to
investors: people who are bad at explaining, talking to people who
are bad at understanding. Practically every successful startup,
including stars like Google, presented at some point to investors
who didn't get it and turned them down. Was it because the founders
were bad at presenting, or because the investors were obtuse? It's
probably always some of both. At the most recent Rehearsal Day, we four Y Combinator partners found
ourselves saying a lot of the same things we said at the last two. So at dinner afterward we collected all our tips about presenting
to investors. Most startups face similar challenges, so we hope
these will be useful to a wider audience. 1. Explain what you're doing. Investors' main question when judging a very early startup is whether
you've made a compelling product. Before they can judge whether
you've built a good x, they have to understand what kind of x you've
built.","They will get very frustrated if instead of telling them what you do, you make them sit through some kind of preamble. Say what you're doing as soon as possible, preferably in the first sentence. ""We're Jeff and Bob and we've built an easy to use web-based database. Now we'll show it to you and explain why people need this."" If you're a great public speaker you may be able to violate this rule. Last year one founder spent the whole first half of his talk on a fascinating analysis of the limits of the conventional desktop metaphor. He got away with it, but unless you're a captivating speaker, which most hackers aren't, it's better to play it safe. 2. Get rapidly to demo. This section is now obsolete for YC founders presenting at Demo Day, because Demo Day presentations are now so short that they rarely include much if any demo. They seem to work just as well without, however, which makes me think I was wrong to emphasize demos so much before. A demo explains what you've made more effectively than any verbal description. The only thing worth talking about first is the problem you're trying to solve and why it's important. But don't spend more than a tenth of your time on that. Then demo. When you demo, don't run through a catalog of features. Instead start with the problem you're solving, and then show how your product solves it. Show features in an order driven by some kind of purpose, rather than the order in which they happen to appear on the screen. If you're demoing something web-based, assume that the network connection will mysteriously die 30 seconds into your presentation, and come prepared with a copy of the server software running on your laptop. 3. Better a narrow description than a vague one. One reason founders resist describing their projects concisely is that, at this early stage, there are all kinds of possibilities. The most concise descriptions seem misleadingly narrow. So for example a group that has built an easy web-based database might resist calling their applicaton that, because it could be so much more. In fact, it could be anything... The problem is, as you approach (in the calculus sense) a description of something that could be anything, the content of your description approaches zero. If you describe your web-based database as ""a system to allow people to collaboratively leverage the value of information,"" it will go in one investor ear and out the other. They'll just discard that sentence as meaningless boilerplate, and hope, with increasing impatience, that in the next sentence you'll actually explain what you've made. Your primary goal is not to describe everything your system might one day become, but simply to convince investors you're worth talking to further. So approach this like an algorithm that gets the right answer by successive approximations. Begin with a description that's gripping but perhaps overly narrow, then flesh it out to the extent","So, for example, if you're building a website, you have to
explain the features and functions. If you're building a physical
product, you have to explain the design, the materials, the
components, the manufacturing, the logistics, etc. If you're building
a service, you have to explain the model, the process, the
organization, the people, the support, the pricing, the
reputation, the market, and so on. This is not just a presentation. This is the very foundation of what you're
building. If you can't explain what you're doing, you can't explain why it's
good. 2. Explain why it's good. Once you've explained what you're doing, you have to explain why it's
good. You have to explain why users will want it. Why is it better than
the current solution? Why is it better than the previous solution? Why is it better
than the competition? Why is it better than what you've built
before? This is the second part of the answer. 3. Keep it simple. This is the most important part. Investors don't want a detailed explanation of your
business. They want to know what you're doing and why it's good. If you
make it more complicated, they get lost. The more you explain, the more you risk making it complicated. So
you have to simplify everything. You have to make it simple. 4. Be confident. Investors want to feel that you're confident. If you sound unsure, they will
think you're not sure about your business. Even if you're not, they will
think you're not. So you have to be confident. 5. Be prepared. You have to know your material. You have to know the product. You have to know your
business. You have to know your market. You have to know your
competitors.

Paul Graham,The Bus Ticket Theory of Genius.txt,"November 2019
Everyone knows that to do great work you need both natural ability
and determination. But there's a third ingredient that's not as
well understood: an obsessive interest in a particular topic. To explain this point I need to burn my reputation with some group
of people, and I'm going to choose bus ticket collectors. There
are people who collect old bus tickets. Like many collectors, they
have an obsessive interest in the minutiae of what they collect. They can keep track of distinctions between different types of bus
tickets that would be hard for the rest of us to remember. Because
we don't care enough. What's the point of spending so much time
thinking about old bus tickets? Which leads us to the second feature of this kind of obsession:
there is no point. A bus ticket collector's love is disinterested. They're not doing it to impress us or to make themselves rich, but
for its own sake. When you look at the lives of people who've done great work, you
see a consistent pattern. They often begin with a bus ticket
collector's obsessive interest in something that would have seemed
pointless to most of their contemporaries. One of the most striking
features of Darwin's book about his voyage on the Beagle is the
sheer depth of his interest in natural history. His curiosity seems
infinite. Ditto for Ramanujan, sitting by the hour working out on
his slate what happens to series. It's a mistake to think they were ""laying the groundwork"" for the
discoveries they made later. There's too much intention in that
metaphor. Like bus ticket collectors, they were doing it
because they liked it. But there is a difference between Ramanujan and a bus ticket
collector. Series matter, and bus tickets don't. If I had to put the recipe for genius into one sentence, that might
be it: to have a disinterested obsession with something that matters. Aren't I forgetting about the other two ingredients? Less than you
might think. An obsessive interest in a topic is both a proxy for
ability and a substitute for determination. Unless you have
sufficient mathematical aptitude, you won't find series interesting. And when you're obsessively interested in something, you don't need
as much determination: you don't need to push yourself as hard when
curiosity is pulling you. An obsessive interest will even bring you luck, to the extent
anything can. Chance, as Pasteur said, favors the prepared mind,
and if there's one thing an obsessed mind is, it's prepared. The disinterestedness of this kind of obsession is its most important
feature. Not just because it's a filter for earnestness, but because
it helps you discover new ideas. The paths that lead to new ideas tend to look unpromising. If they
looked promising, other people would already have explored them. How do the people who do great work discover these paths that others
overlook?","The popular story is that they simply have better vision: because they're so talented, they see paths that others miss. But if you look at the way great discoveries are made, that's not what happens. Darwin didn't pay closer attention to individual species than other people because he saw that this would lead to great discoveries, and they didn't. He was just really, really interested in such things. Darwin couldn't turn it off. Neither could Ramanujan. They didn't discover the hidden paths that they did because they seemed promising, but because they couldn't help it. That's what allowed them to follow paths that someone who was merely ambitious would have ignored. What rational person would decide that the way to write great novels was to begin by spending several years creating an imaginary elvish language, like Tolkien, or visiting every household in southwestern Britain, like Trollope? No one, including Tolkien and Trollope. The bus ticket theory is similar to Carlyle's famous definition of genius as an infinite capacity for taking pains. But there are two differences. The bus ticket theory makes it clear that the source of this infinite capacity for taking pains is not infinite diligence, as Carlyle seems to have meant, but the sort of infinite interest that collectors have. It also adds an important qualification: an infinite capacity for taking pains about something that matters. So what matters? You can never be sure. It's precisely because no one can tell in advance which paths are promising that you can discover new ideas by working on what you're interested in. But there are some heuristics you can use to guess whether an obsession might be one that matters. For example, it's more promising if you're creating something, rather than just consuming something someone else creates. It's more promising if something you're interested in is difficult, especially if it's more difficult for other people than it is for you. And the obsessions of talented people are more likely to be promising. When talented people become interested in random things, they're not truly random. But you can never be sure. In fact, here's an interesting idea that's also rather alarming if it's true: it may be that to do great work, you also have to waste a lot of time. In many different areas, reward is proportionate to risk. If that rule holds here, then the way to find paths that lead to truly great work is to be willing to expend a lot of effort on things that turn out to be every bit as unpromising as they seem. I'm not sure if this is true. On one hand, it seems surprisingly difficult to waste your time so long as you're working hard on something interesting. So much of what you do ends up being useful. But on the other hand, the rule about the relationship between risk and reward is so powerful that it seems to hold wherever risk occurs. Newton's case, at least, suggests that the risk/reward","Because they're not looking for them. They're looking at things that
others don't. They're not looking for the new, they're looking at the new. It's the same reason that great art is created by people who look
at the world in a different way. The difference between the person who looks at the world
in a different way and the person who just happens to have a
different way of looking at the world is that the former is
obsessed. So, what's the point of this long-winded argument? It's to make a case
for the importance of having an obsessive interest in something
that matters. The main point is that this kind of obsession is the key to genius. That's why the author says, ""I'm going to choose bus ticket
collectors"" to make a point about the importance of having such an obsession.
The author's main point is that an obsessive interest in something that matters is the key to genius. The author supports this claim with examples of historical figures like Darwin and Ramanujan, who had such obsessions. The author also explains that this kind of obsession is not just about ability or determination but is a combination of both, and that it can lead to new discoveries because it allows people to look at things in a different way.

Paul Graham,How Y Combinator Started.txt,"March 2012
Y Combinator's 7th birthday was March 11. As usual we were so
busy we didn't notice till a few days after. I don't think we've
ever managed to remember our birthday on our birthday. On March 11 2005, Jessica and I were walking home from dinner in
Harvard Square. Jessica was working at an investment bank at the
time, but she didn't like it much, so she had interviewed for a job
as director of marketing at a Boston VC fund. The VC fund was doing
what now seems a comically familiar thing for a VC fund to do:
taking a long time to make up their mind. Meanwhile I had been
telling Jessica all the things they should change about the VC
business — essentially the ideas now underlying Y Combinator:
investors
should be making more, smaller investments, they should be funding
hackers instead of suits, they should be willing to fund younger
founders, etc. At the time I had been thinking about doing some angel investing. I
had just given a talk to the undergraduate computer club at Harvard
about
how to start a
startup, and it
hit me afterward that although I had always
meant to do angel investing, 7 years had now passed since I got
enough money to do it, and I still hadn't started. I had also
been thinking about ways to work with Robert Morris and Trevor
Blackwell again. A few hours before I had
sent them an email trying to figure out what we could do together. Between Harvard Square and my house the idea gelled. We'd start
our own investment firm and Jessica could work for that instead. As we turned onto Walker Street we decided to do it. I agreed to
put $100k into the new fund and Jessica agreed to quit her job to
work for it. Over the next couple days I recruited Robert
and Trevor, who put in another $50k each. So YC
started with $200k. Jessica was so happy to be able to quit her job and start her own
company that I took her picture
when we got home. The company wasn't called Y Combinator yet. At first we called it
Cambridge Seed. But that name never saw the light of day, because
by the time we announced it a few days later, we'd changed the name
to Y Combinator. We realized early on that what we were doing could
be national in scope and we didn't want a name that tied us to one
place. Initially we only had part of the idea. We were going to do
seed funding with standardized terms. Before YC, seed funding was
very haphazard. You'd get that first $10k from your friend's rich
uncle. The deal terms were often a disaster; often neither the
investor nor the founders nor the lawyer knew what the documents
should look like. Facebook's early history as a Florida LLC shows
how random things could be in those days.","We were going to be something there had not been before: a standard source of seed funding. We modelled YC on the seed funding we ourselves had taken when we started Viaweb. We started Viaweb with $10k we got from our friend Julian Weber, the husband of Idelle Weber, whose painting class I took as a grad student at Harvard. Julian knew about business, but you would not describe him as a suit. Among other things he'd been president of the National Lampoon. He was also a lawyer, and got all our paperwork set up properly. In return for $10k, getting us set up as a company, teaching us what business was about, and remaining calm in times of crisis, Julian got 10% of Viaweb. I remember thinking once what a good deal Julian got. And then a second later I realized that without Julian, Viaweb would never have made it. So even though it was a good deal for him, it was a good deal for us too. That's why I knew there was room for something like Y Combinator. Initially we didn't have what turned out to be the most important idea: funding startups synchronously, instead of asynchronously as it had always been done before. Or rather we had the idea, but we didn't realize its significance. We decided very early that the first thing we'd do would be to fund a bunch of startups over the coming summer. But we didn't realize initially that this would be the way we'd do all our investing. The reason we began by funding a bunch of startups at once was not that we thought it would be a better way to fund startups, but simply because we wanted to learn how to be angel investors, and a summer program for undergrads seemed the fastest way to do it. No one takes summer jobs that seriously. The opportunity cost for a bunch of undergrads to spend a summer working on startups was low enough that we wouldn't feel guilty encouraging them to do it. We knew students would already be making plans for the summer, so we did what we're always telling startups to do: we launched fast. Here are the initial announcement and description of what was at the time called the Summer Founders Program. We got lucky in that the length and structure of a summer program turns out to be perfect for what we do. The structure of the YC cycle is still almost identical to what it was that first summer. We also got lucky in who the first batch of founders were. We never expected to make any money from that first batch. We thought of the money we were investing as a combination of an educational expense and a charitable donation. But the founders in the first batch turned out to be surprisingly good. And great people too. We're still friends with a lot of them today. It's hard for people to realize now how","So we thought we'd create a fund with standard terms, so that
founders could be confident that if they got funded, they
would have a good deal. We thought that maybe the VC community could be
reformed through the standardization of terms. That was our original idea. We thought that if we created a fund with standardized terms, and
did it quickly, and with a high amount of due diligence, then we'd
be able to have a better product than the other funds. We thought we'd do it in a way that was scalable. So we thought that maybe we could do it in a way that could be
repeated. So we thought of doing it in a way that could be replicated in
different cities, which led us to the idea of a
""startup accelerator."" So the idea was that we'd take a group of startups, do a
couple of weeks of intense work, and then let them go. Then we'd have a
new group of startups, and repeat the process. This was a
novel idea at the time. I think that's why we were able to get the
funding so quickly. We had an idea that was
novel, and we had a team that was also novel — Jessica and I
were the only people doing this. We had a plan that was novel — we thought of doing a
startup accelerator, which was a new idea. And we had a name that was novel — Y Combinator. So that was the beginning. We had a plan, and we had a way of
executing it, and we had a team, and we had the
funding. But we had no idea what would happen next. We had no idea that the
accelerator would become the core of our business. We had no idea that we would be able to fund more than 100 startups
over the years. We had no idea that we'd",498,500,324,0.1741,0.1794,0.9712,0.912,0.9674,0.9004,-0.5936,-1.8143,0.4048,0.3483,0.0519,0.048,0.007,0.0084,0.5854,0.4986,0.9805,0.9612,0.4543828264758497,0.4767857142857143,0.546448087431694,6,6,0.9971,0.9769,0.11646586345381527,0.114,0.12962962962962962,0.8511,0.6179,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,What I've Learned from Users.txt,"September 2022
I recently told applicants to Y Combinator that the best advice I
could give for getting in, per word, was
Explain what you've learned from users. That tests a lot of things: whether you're paying attention to
users, how well you understand them, and even how much they need
what you're making. Afterward I asked myself the same question. What have I learned
from YC's users, the startups we've funded? The first thing that came to mind was that most startups have the
same problems. No two have exactly the same problems, but it's
surprising how much the problems remain the same, regardless of
what they're making. Once you've advised 100 startups all doing
different things, you rarely encounter problems you haven't seen
before. This fact is one of the things that makes YC work. But I didn't
know it when we started YC. I only had a few data points: our own
startup, and those started by friends. It was a surprise to me how
often the same problems recur in different forms. Many later stage
investors might never realize this, because later stage investors
might not advise 100 startups in their whole career, but a YC partner
will get this much experience in the first year or two. That's one advantage of funding large numbers of early stage companies
rather than smaller numbers of later-stage ones. You get a lot of
data. Not just because you're looking at more companies, but also
because more goes wrong. But knowing (nearly) all the problems startups can encounter doesn't
mean that advising them can be automated, or reduced to a formula. There's no substitute for individual office hours with a YC partner. Each startup is unique, which means they have to be advised
by specific partners who know them well. [1]
We learned that the hard way, in the notorious ""batch that broke
YC"" in the summer of 2012. Up till that point we treated the partners
as a pool. When a startup requested office hours, they got the next
available slot posted by any partner. That meant every partner had
to know every startup. This worked fine up to 60 startups, but when
the batch grew to 80, everything broke. The founders probably didn't
realize anything was wrong, but the partners were confused and
unhappy because halfway through the batch they still didn't know
all the companies yet. [2]
At first I was puzzled. How could things be fine at 60 startups and
broken at 80? It was only a third more. Then I realized what had
happened. We were using an O(n2) algorithm. So of course it blew
up. The solution we adopted was the classic one in these situations. We sharded the batch into smaller groups of startups, each overseen
by a dedicated group of partners. That fixed the problem, and has
worked fine ever since.","But the batch that broke YC was a powerful demonstration of how individualized the process of advising startups has to be. Another related surprise is how bad founders can be at realizing what their problems are. Founders will sometimes come in to talk about some problem, and we'll discover another much bigger one in the course of the conversation. For example (and this case is all too common), founders will come in to talk about the difficulties they're having raising money, and after digging into their situation, it turns out the reason is that the company is doing badly, and investors can tell. Or founders will come in worried that they still haven't cracked the problem of user acquisition, and the reason turns out to be that their product isn't good enough. There have been times when I've asked ""Would you use this yourself, if you hadn't built it?"" and the founders, on thinking about it, said ""No."" Well, there's the reason you're having trouble getting users. Often founders know what their problems are, but not their relative importance. [3] They'll come in to talk about three problems they're worrying about. One is of moderate importance, one doesn't matter at all, and one will kill the company if it isn't addressed immediately. It's like watching one of those horror movies where the heroine is deeply upset that her boyfriend cheated on her, and only mildly curious about the door that's mysteriously ajar. You want to say: never mind about your boyfriend, think about that door! Fortunately in office hours you can. So while startups still die with some regularity, it's rarely because they wandered into a room containing a murderer. The YC partners can warn them where the murderers are. Not that founders listen. That was another big surprise: how often founders don't listen to us. A couple weeks ago I talked to a partner who had been working for YC for a couple batches and was starting to see the pattern. ""They come back a year later,"" she said, ""and say 'We wish we'd listened to you.'"" It took me a long time to figure out why founders don't listen. At first I thought it was mere stubbornness. That's part of the reason, but another and probably more important reason is that so much about startups is counterintuitive. And when you tell someone something counterintuitive, what it sounds to them is wrong. So the reason founders don't listen to us is that they don't believe us. At least not till experience teaches them otherwise. [4] The reason startups are so counterintuitive is that they're so different from most people's other experiences. No one knows what it's like except those who've done it. Which is why YC partners should usually have been founders themselves. But strangely enough, the counterintuitiveness of startups turns out to be another of the things that make YC work. If it weren't counterintuitive, founders wouldn't need our advice about how to do it. Focus is doubly","But the lesson was
important. We couldn't just treat the partners as a pool. We needed to
have a way to group them with the startups that they were
assigned to. The same problem arises in many other situations. For example, in
large-scale software development, it's easy to assign developers
to tasks in a random way. But that leads to situations where a
developer is assigned to multiple tasks, and the code they write
can be inconsistent or broken. So the solution is to have
each developer work on a single task, or at least a small set of
related tasks. In both cases, the problem is that we're trying to
assign too many things to one person. The solution is to have a
limited number of things assigned to each person, and to make
sure that the same person doesn't work on unrelated tasks. This is a very general principle. It applies to many different areas. For example, in education, if a teacher is
assigned to too many students, they may not be able to give
personal attention. In manufacturing, if a machine is assigned to too many
tasks, it may be overloaded. In healthcare, if a doctor is assigned too many
patients, they may be overwhelmed. So the same problem arises in many different areas, and the solution is the same: assign
a limited number of things to each person. [3]
In this case, we had to assign each partner to a small number of
startups. The result is that each partner has a limited
number of startups to know. It also means that the partners can
focus on the startups they're assigned to, rather than
trying to be a generalist. This has had the added benefit of making the
YC experience more personal for the startups. When a startup is
assigned to a partner, they get the attention of a specific person
rather than being assigned to a group. It's more likely that the",480,500,327,0.2364,0.1783,0.9654,0.9224,0.9163,0.9488,1.3778,0.8139,0.3911,0.3545,0.0356,0.0432,0.0042,0.0026,0.7232,0.3251,0.9723,0.9545,0.42526690391459077,0.45226130653266333,0.48257372654155495,5,6,0.9595,0.9719,0.17291666666666666,0.196,0.1437308868501529,0.9498,0.7672,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,Let the Other 95% of Great Programmers In.txt,"December 2014
American technology companies want the government to make immigration
easier because they say they can't find enough programmers in the
US. Anti-immigration people say that instead of letting foreigners
take these jobs, we should train more Americans to be programmers. Who's right? The technology companies are right. What the anti-immigration people
don't understand is that there is a huge variation in ability between
competent programmers and exceptional ones, and while you can train
people to be competent, you can't train them to be exceptional. Exceptional programmers have an aptitude for and
interest in
programming that is not merely the product of training. [1]
The US has less than 5% of the world's population. Which means if
the qualities that make someone a great programmer are evenly
distributed, 95% of great programmers are born outside the US. The anti-immigration people have to invent some explanation to
account for all the effort technology companies have expended trying
to make immigration easier. So they claim it's because they want
to drive down salaries. But if you talk to startups, you find
practically every one over a certain size has gone through legal
contortions to get programmers into the US, where they then
paid them the same as they'd have paid an American. Why would they
go to extra trouble to get programmers for the same price? The
only explanation is that they're telling the truth: there are just
not enough great programmers to go around. [2]
I asked the CEO of a startup with about 70 programmers how many
more he'd hire if he could get all the great programmers he wanted. He said ""We'd hire 30 tomorrow morning."" And this is one of the
hot startups that always win recruiting battles. It's the same all
over Silicon Valley. Startups are that constrained for talent. It would be great if more Americans were trained as programmers,
but no amount of training can flip a ratio as overwhelming as 95
to 5. Especially since programmers are being trained in other
countries too. Barring some cataclysm, it will always be true that
most great programmers are born outside the US. It will always be
true that most people who are great at anything are born outside
the US. [3]
Exceptional performance implies immigration. A country with only
a few percent of the world's population will be exceptional in some
field only if there are a lot of immigrants working in it. But this whole discussion has taken something for granted: that if
we let more great programmers into the US, they'll want to come. That's true now, and we don't realize how lucky we are that it is. If we want to keep this option open, the best way to do it is to
take advantage of it: the more of the world's great programmers are
here, the more the rest will want to come here. And if we don't, the US could be seriously fucked.","I realize that's strong language, but the people dithering about this don't seem to realize the power of the forces at work here. Technology gives the best programmers huge leverage. The world market in programmers seems to be becoming dramatically more liquid. And since good people like good colleagues, that means the best programmers could collect in just a few hubs. Maybe mostly in one hub. What if most of the great programmers collected in one hub, and it wasn't here? That scenario may seem unlikely now, but it won't be if things change as much in the next 50 years as they did in the last 50. We have the potential to ensure that the US remains a technology superpower just by letting in a few thousand great programmers a year. What a colossal mistake it would be to let that opportunity slip. It could easily be the defining mistake this generation of American politicians later become famous for. And unlike other potential mistakes on that scale, it costs nothing to fix. So please, get on with it. Notes [1] How much better is a great programmer than an ordinary one? So much better that you can't even measure the difference directly. A great programmer doesn't merely do the same work faster. A great programmer will invent things an ordinary programmer would never even think of. This doesn't mean a great programmer is infinitely more valuable, because any invention has a finite market value. But it's easy to imagine cases where a great programmer might invent things worth 100x or even 1000x an average programmer's salary. [2] There are a handful of consulting firms that rent out big pools of foreign programmers they bring in on H1-B visas. By all means crack down on these. It should be easy to write legislation that distinguishes them, because they are so different from technology companies. But it is dishonest of the anti-immigration people to claim that companies like Google and Facebook are driven by the same motives. An influx of inexpensive but mediocre programmers is the last thing they'd want; it would destroy them. [3] Though this essay talks about programmers, the group of people we need to import is broader, ranging from designers to programmers to electrical engineers. The best one could do as a general term might be ""digital talent."" It seemed better to make the argument a little too narrow than to confuse everyone with a neologism.

Paul Graham,News from the Front.txt,"September 2007
A few weeks ago I had a thought so heretical that it really surprised
me. It may not matter all that much where you go to college. For me, as for a lot of middle class kids, getting into a good
college was more or less the meaning of life when I was growing up. What was I? A student. To do that well meant to get good grades. Why did one have to get good grades? To get into a good college. And why did one want to do that? There seemed to be several reasons:
you'd learn more, get better jobs, make more money. But it didn't
matter exactly what the benefits would be. College was a bottleneck
through which all your future prospects passed; everything would
be better if you went to a better college. A few weeks ago I realized that somewhere along the line I had
stopped believing that. What first set me thinking about this was the new trend of worrying
obsessively about what
kindergarten
your kids go to. It seemed to
me this couldn't possibly matter. Either it won't help your kid
get into Harvard, or if it does, getting into Harvard won't mean
much anymore. And then I thought: how much does it mean even now? It turns out I have a lot of data about that. My three partners
and I run a seed stage investment firm called
Y Combinator. We
invest when the company is just a couple guys and an idea. The
idea doesn't matter much; it will change anyway. Most of our
decision is based on the founders. The average founder is three
years out of college. Many have just graduated; a few are still
in school. So we're in much the same position as a graduate program,
or a company hiring people right out of college. Except our choices
are immediately and visibly tested. There are two possible outcomes
for a startup: success or failure—and usually you know within a
year which it will be. The test applied to a startup is among the purest of real world
tests. A startup succeeds or fails depending almost entirely on
the efforts of the founders. Success is decided by the market: you
only succeed if users like what you've built. And users don't care
where you went to college. As well as having precisely measurable results, we have a lot of
them. Instead of doing a small number of large deals like a
traditional venture capital fund, we do a large number of small
ones. We currently fund about 40 companies a year, selected from
about 900 applications representing a total of about 2000 people. [1]
Between the volume of people we judge and the rapid, unequivocal
test that's applied to our choices, Y Combinator has been an
unprecedented opportunity for learning how to pick winners. One
of the most surprising things we've learned is how little it matters
where people went to college.","I thought I'd already been cured of caring about that. There's nothing like going to grad school at Harvard to cure you of any illusions you might have about the average Harvard undergrad. And yet Y Combinator showed us we were still overestimating people who'd been to elite colleges. We'd interview people from MIT or Harvard or Stanford and sometimes find ourselves thinking: they must be smarter than they seem. It took us a few iterations to learn to trust our senses. Practically everyone thinks that someone who went to MIT or Harvard or Stanford must be smart. Even people who hate you for it believe it. But when you think about what it means to have gone to an elite college, how could this be true? We're talking about a decision made by admissions officers—basically, HR people—based on a cursory examination of a huge pile of depressingly similar applications submitted by seventeen year olds. And what do they have to go on? An easily gamed standardized test; a short essay telling you what the kid thinks you want to hear; an interview with a random alum; a high school record that's largely an index of obedience. Who would rely on such a test? And yet a lot of companies do. A lot of companies are very much influenced by where applicants went to college. How could they be? I think I know the answer to that. There used to be a saying in the corporate world: ""No one ever got fired for buying IBM."" You no longer hear this about IBM specifically, but the idea is very much alive; there is a whole category of ""enterprise"" software companies that exist to take advantage of it. People buying technology for large organizations don't care if they pay a fortune for mediocre software. It's not their money. They just want to buy from a supplier who seems safe—a company with an established name, confident salesmen, impressive offices, and software that conforms to all the current fashions. Not necessarily a company that will deliver so much as one that, if they do let you down, will still seem to have been a prudent choice. So companies have evolved to fill that niche. A recruiter at a big company is in much the same position as someone buying technology for one. If someone went to Stanford and is not obviously insane, they're probably a safe bet. And a safe bet is enough. No one ever measures recruiters by the later performance of people they turn down. [2] I'm not saying, of course, that elite colleges have evolved to prey upon the weaknesses of large organizations the way enterprise software companies have. But they work as if they had. In addition to the power of the brand name, graduates of elite colleges have two critical qualities that plug right into the way large organizations work. They're good at doing what they're asked, since that's what it takes to please the adults who judge you","We've seen many people from top schools fail. We've seen many people from less prestigious schools succeed. So the conclusion is that the value of a college education is not in the institution itself, but in the
individual. The value is in the person's ability to learn, to
think, and to work. What's the alternative? We can think of a few. One is that the college
system is a kind of social ladder, in which you can only get on
by going to a good school. But the evidence we've seen suggests that is not the case. We've seen people who went to less prestigious schools
get ahead, and people who went to top schools not get ahead. The other alternative is that the college system is a kind of
filter, which is supposed to separate the best people from the
rest. But that seems to be the opposite of what's happening. We've seen people from top schools fail, and people from less
prestigious schools succeed. So, the idea that college is the key to a better future is
not valid. The problem is not that we are being too selective, or that the
education system is flawed, but that we are focusing on the
wrong thing. We are trying to get people to go to college. We are
trying to get people to go to a good college. The real question is, what do we want people to learn? The answer is not where they go to school, but what they learn. We are trying to get people to go to college. We are trying to get people to go to a good college. The real question is, what do we want people to learn? The answer is not where they go to school, but what they learn.

Paul Graham,Frighteningly Ambitious Startup Ideas.txt,"Want to start a startup? Get funded by
Y Combinator. March 2012
One of the more surprising things I've noticed while working
on Y Combinator is how frightening the most ambitious startup
ideas are. In this essay I'm going to demonstrate
this phenomenon by describing some. Any one of them
could make you a billionaire. That might sound like an attractive
prospect, and yet when I describe these ideas you may
notice you find yourself shrinking away from them. Don't worry, it's not a sign of weakness. Arguably it's a sign of
sanity. The biggest startup ideas are terrifying. And not just
because they'd be a lot of work. The biggest ideas seem to threaten
your identity: you wonder if you'd have enough ambition to carry
them through. There's a scene in Being John Malkovich where the nerdy hero
encounters a very attractive, sophisticated woman. She says to
him:
Here's the thing: If you ever got me, you wouldn't have a clue
what to do with me. That's what these ideas say to us. This phenomenon is one of the most important things you can understand
about startups. [1]
You'd expect big startup ideas to be
attractive, but actually they tend to repel you. And that has a
bunch of consequences. It means these ideas are invisible to most
people who try to think of startup ideas, because their subconscious
filters them out. Even the most ambitious people are probably best
off approaching them obliquely. 1. A New Search Engine
The best ideas are just on the right side of impossible. I don't
know if this one is possible, but there are signs it might be. Making a new search engine means competing with Google, and recently
I've noticed some cracks in their fortress. The point when it became clear to me that Microsoft had lost their
way was when they decided to get into the search business. That
was not a natural move for Microsoft. They did it because they
were afraid of Google, and Google was in the search business. But
this meant (a) Google was now setting Microsoft's agenda, and (b)
Microsoft's agenda consisted of stuff they weren't good at. Microsoft : Google :: Google : Facebook. That does not by itself mean
there's room for a new search engine, but lately when using Google
search I've found myself nostalgic for the old days, when
Google was true to its own slightly aspy self. Google used to give
me a page of the right answers, fast, with no clutter. Now the
results seem inspired by the Scientologist principle that what's
true is what's true for you. And the pages don't have the
clean, sparse feel they used to. Google search results used to
look like the output of a Unix utility. Now if I accidentally put
the cursor in the wrong place, anything might happen. The way to win here is to build the search engine all the hackers
use.","A search engine whose users consisted of the top 10,000 hackers and no one else would be in a very powerful position despite its small size, just as Google was when it was that search engine. And for the first time in over a decade the idea of switching seems thinkable to me. Since anyone capable of starting this company is one of those 10,000 hackers, the route is at least straightforward: make the search engine you yourself want. Feel free to make it excessively hackerish. Make it really good for code search, for example. Would you like search queries to be Turing complete? Anything that gets you those 10,000 users is ipso facto good. Don't worry if something you want to do will constrain you in the long term, because if you don't get that initial core of users, there won't be a long term. If you can just build something that you and your friends genuinely prefer to Google, you're already about 10% of the way to an IPO, just as Facebook was (though they probably didn't realize it) when they got all the Harvard undergrads. 2. Replace Email Email was not designed to be used the way we use it now. Email is not a messaging protocol. It's a todo list. Or rather, my inbox is a todo list, and email is the way things get onto it. But it is a disastrously bad todo list. I'm open to different types of solutions to this problem, but I suspect that tweaking the inbox is not enough, and that email has to be replaced with a new protocol. This new protocol should be a todo list protocol, not a messaging protocol, although there is a degenerate case where what someone wants you to do is: read the following text. As a todo list protocol, the new protocol should give more power to the recipient than email does. I want there to be more restrictions on what someone can put on my todo list. And when someone can put something on my todo list, I want them to tell me more about what they want from me. Do they want me to do something beyond just reading some text? How important is it? (There obviously has to be some mechanism to prevent people from saying everything is important.) When does it have to be done? This is one of those ideas that's like an irresistible force meeting an immovable object. On one hand, entrenched protocols are impossible to replace. On the other, it seems unlikely that people in 100 years will still be living in the same email hell we do now. And if email is going to get replaced eventually, why not now? If you do it right, you may be able to avoid the usual chicken and egg problem new protocols face, because some of the most powerful people in the world will be among the first to switch to it. They're all at the mercy of","That is, the one that is not in the hands of the powerful. [2]
The idea is that Google is not the best way to search. Maybe
there's another way. The idea is that the way we search
now is too user-friendly. Maybe we can make it more
technical, more like the Unix command line. [2]
So the idea is: Build a search engine that is used by hackers
and developers, not by the general public. That's a more
narrow market, but it's a market that's growing. Maybe the
best way to build this search engine is to create a tool that
helps developers find the right code for the right problem. That is,
build a search engine for code. [2]
But that's not a full search engine. So, the idea is to
build a search engine that's a better version of the Unix
command line. [2]
But that's not a search engine. So, the idea is to build
a search engine that is not built by the powerful, but by
hackers. [2]
So, the idea is to build a search engine that is not built by the

This seems to be the same idea. But the point is that the
idea is so strange that it's not obvious. It's not obvious that you can
build a search engine that's not in the hands of the powerful. [2]
But I think the idea is that the current search engine is in the hands
of the powerful. And that the hackers are the ones who can
build it. So, the idea is to build a search engine that's not in the

Paul Graham,The Right Kind of Stubborn.txt,"July 2024
Successful people tend to be persistent. New ideas often don't work
at first, but they're not deterred. They keep trying and eventually
find something that does. Mere obstinacy, on the other hand, is a recipe for failure. Obstinate
people are so annoying. They won't listen. They beat their heads
against a wall and get nowhere. But is there any real difference between these two cases? Are
persistent and obstinate people actually behaving differently? Or
are they doing the same thing, and we just label them later as
persistent or obstinate depending on whether they turned out to be
right or not? If that's the only difference then there's nothing to be learned
from the distinction. Telling someone to be persistent rather than
obstinate would just be telling them to be right rather than wrong,
and they already know that. Whereas if persistence and obstinacy
are actually different kinds of behavior, it would be worthwhile
to tease them apart. [1]
I've talked to a lot of determined people, and it seems to me that
they're different kinds of behavior. I've often walked away from a
conversation thinking either ""Wow, that guy is determined"" or ""Damn,
that guy is stubborn,"" and I don't think I'm just talking about
whether they seemed right or not. That's part of it, but not all
of it. There's something annoying about the obstinate that's not simply
due to being mistaken. They won't listen. And that's not true of
all determined people. I can't think of anyone more determined than
the Collison brothers, and when you point out a problem to them,
they not only listen, but listen with an almost predatory intensity. Is there a hole in the bottom of their boat? Probably not, but if
there is, they want to know about it. It's the same with most successful people. They're never more
engaged than when you disagree with them. Whereas the obstinate
don't want to hear you. When you point out problems, their eyes
glaze over, and their replies sound like ideologues talking about
matters of doctrine. [2]
The reason the persistent and the obstinate seem similar is that
they're both hard to stop. But they're hard to stop in different
senses. The persistent are like boats whose engines can't be throttled
back. The obstinate are like boats whose rudders can't be turned. [3]
In the degenerate case they're indistinguishable: when there's only
one way to solve a problem, your only choice is whether to give up
or not, and persistence and obstinacy both say no. This is presumably
why the two are so often conflated in popular culture. It assumes
simple problems. But as problems get more complicated, we can see
the difference between them. The persistent are much more attached
to points high in the decision tree than to minor ones lower down,
while the obstinate spray ""don't give up"" indiscriminately over the
whole tree. The persistent are attached to the goal.","The obstinate are attached to their ideas about how to reach it. Worse still, that means they'll tend to be attached to their first ideas about how to solve a problem, even though these are the least informed by the experience of working on it. So the obstinate aren't merely attached to details, but disproportionately likely to be attached to wrong ones. Why are they like this? Why are the obstinate obstinate? One possibility is that they're overwhelmed. They're not very capable. They take on a hard problem. They're immediately in over their head. So they grab onto ideas the way someone on the deck of a rolling ship might grab onto the nearest handhold. That was my initial theory, but on examination it doesn't hold up. If being obstinate were simply a consequence of being in over one's head, you could make persistent people become obstinate by making them solve harder problems. But that's not what happens. If you handed the Collisons an extremely hard problem to solve, they wouldn't become obstinate. If anything they'd become less obstinate. They'd know they had to be open to anything. Similarly, if obstinacy were caused by the situation, the obstinate would stop being obstinate when solving easier problems. But they don't. And if obstinacy isn't caused by the situation, it must come from within. It must be a feature of one's personality. Obstinacy is a reflexive resistance to changing one's ideas. This is not identical with stupidity, but they're closely related. A reflexive resistance to changing one's ideas becomes a sort of induced stupidity as contrary evidence mounts. And obstinacy is a form of not giving up that's easily practiced by the stupid. You don't have to consider complicated tradeoffs; you just dig in your heels. It even works, up to a point. The fact that obstinacy works for simple problems is an important clue. Persistence and obstinacy aren't opposites. The relationship between them is more like the relationship between the two kinds of respiration we can do: aerobic respiration, and the anaerobic respiration we inherited from our most distant ancestors. Anaerobic respiration is a more primitive process, but it has its uses. When you leap suddenly away from a threat, that's what you're using. The optimal amount of obstinacy is not zero. It can be good if your initial reaction to a setback is an unthinking ""I won't give up,"" because this helps prevent panic. But unthinking only gets you so far. The further someone is toward the obstinate end of the continuum, the less likely they are to succeed in solving hard problems. [4] Obstinacy is a simple thing. Animals have it. But persistence turns out to have a fairly complicated internal structure. One thing that distinguishes the persistent is their energy. At the risk of putting too much weight on words, they persist rather than merely resisting. They keep trying things. Which means the persistent must also be imaginative. To keep trying things, you have to keep thinking of","They're
interested in the path. The obstinate are interested in the
dogma. [4]
The persistent person is more likely to be in the process of
learning something new. They are more likely to be in a state of
uncertainty. They are more likely to be open to change. The
obstinate person, on the other hand, is more likely to be in a
state of certainty. They are more likely to be resistant to change.

[6]
I think the key to distinguishing between the two is that the
persistent person is willing to change their mind. The obstinate
person is not. They are not necessarily wrong, but they are
not willing to change. [7]

Paul Graham,The Best Essay.txt,"March 2024
Despite its title this isn't meant to be the best essay. My goal
here is to figure out what the best essay would be like. It would be well-written, but you can write well about any topic. What made it special would be what it was about. Obviously some topics would be better than others. It probably
wouldn't be about this year's lipstick colors. But it wouldn't be
vaporous talk about elevated themes either. A good essay has to be
surprising. It has to tell people something they don't already know. The best essay would be on the most important topic you could tell
people something surprising about. That may sound obvious, but it has some unexpected consequences. One is that science enters the picture like an elephant stepping
into a rowboat. For example, Darwin first described the idea of
natural selection in an essay written in 1844. Talk about an
important topic you could tell people something surprising about. If that's the test of a great essay, this was surely the best one
written in 1844. And indeed, the best possible essay at any given
time would usually be one describing the most important scientific
or technological discovery it was possible to make. [1]
Another unexpected consequence: I imagined when I started writing
this that the best essay would be fairly timeless — that the best
essay you could write in 1844 would be much the same as the best
one you could write now. But in fact the opposite seems to be true. It might be true that the best painting would be timeless in this
sense. But it wouldn't be impressive to write an essay introducing
natural selection now. The best essay now would be one describing
a great discovery we didn't yet know about. If the question of how to write the best possible essay reduces to
the question of how to make great discoveries, then I started with
the wrong question. Perhaps what this exercise shows is that we
shouldn't waste our time writing essays but instead focus on making
discoveries in some specific domain. But I'm interested in essays
and what can be done with them, so I want to see if there's some
other question I could have asked. There is, and on the face of it, it seems almost identical to the
one I started with. Instead of asking what would the best essay
be? I should have asked how do you write essays well? Though
these seem only phrasing apart, their answers diverge. The answer
to the first question, as we've seen, isn't really about essay
writing. The second question forces it to be. Writing essays, at its best, is a way of discovering ideas. How do
you do that well? How do you discover by writing?","An essay should ordinarily start with what I'm going to call a question, though I mean this in a very general sense: it doesn't have to be a question grammatically, just something that acts like one in the sense that it spurs some response. How do you get this initial question? It probably won't work to choose some important-sounding topic at random and go at it. Professional traders won't even trade unless they have what they call an edge — a convincing story about why in some class of trades they'll win more than they lose. Similarly, you shouldn't attack a topic unless you have a way in — some new insight about it or way of approaching it. You don't need to have a complete thesis; you just need some kind of gap you can explore. In fact, merely having questions about something other people take for granted can be edge enough. If you come across a question that's sufficiently puzzling, it could be worth exploring even if it doesn't seem very momentous. Many an important discovery has been made by pulling on a thread that seemed insignificant at first. How can they all be finches? [2] Once you've got a question, then what? You start thinking out loud about it. Not literally out loud, but you commit to a specific string of words in response, as you would if you were talking. This initial response is usually mistaken or incomplete. Writing converts your ideas from vague to bad. But that's a step forward, because once you can see the brokenness, you can fix it. Perhaps beginning writers are alarmed at the thought of starting with something mistaken or incomplete, but you shouldn't be, because this is why essay writing works. Forcing yourself to commit to some specific string of words gives you a starting point, and if it's wrong, you'll see that when you reread it. At least half of essay writing is rereading what you've written and asking is this correct and complete? You have to be very strict when rereading, not just because you want to keep yourself honest, but because a gap between your response and the truth is often a sign of new ideas to be discovered. The prize for being strict with what you've written is not just refinement. When you take a roughly correct answer and try to make it exactly right, sometimes you find that you can't, and that the reason is that you were depending on a false assumption. And when you discard it, the answer turns out to be completely different. [3] Ideally the response to a question is two things: the first step in a process that converges on the truth, and a source of additional questions (in my very general sense of the word). So the process continues recursively, as response spurs response. [4] Usually there are several possible responses to a question, which means you're traversing a tree. But essays are linear, not tree-shaped, which means","That's a more
direct question. And that's the question I want to answer. [2]
So the goal of this essay is not to write the best possible essay,
but to write an essay that's good enough to be worth reading. [3]

So, what's the difference between the two questions: what is the best essay, and how do you write a good essay? The first is about the nature of the best essay. The second is about the process of writing essays. The first is what is it that makes an essay the best? The second is what is the process of writing an essay that is good? The first is about the content, the second is about the form. The first is about the product, the second is about the process. The first is about what the essay is, the second is about how to make it. So the first question is about the essay's essence. The second is about the essay's creation. [4]

Now, I want to turn this into a question about the process of writing. So the question becomes: how do you write a good essay? The answer to that question is the subject of this essay. [5]

I will now proceed to write an essay about how to write a good essay. I will not write an essay that is the best possible essay, but one that is good enough to be worth reading. [6]

I will start by discussing the difference between an essay and a paper. In academic settings, the terms are often used interchangeably, but they are not the same. A paper is a structured, formal document that is typically written for a class or an assignment. It usually has an introduction, body, and conclusion, with clear sections and a thesis statement. An essay, on the other hand, is more flexible and informal. It can be written for various purposes, such as a personal reflection, an argument, or a narrative. The structure of an essay is less rigid, and",468,500,336,0.2006,0.4557,0.9532,0.8895,0.7597,0.9385,4.6094,-0.8958,0.3896,0.4256,0.0369,0.0963,0.0022,0.0331,0.456,0.4302,0.9543,0.9496,0.44045368620037806,0.47150259067357514,0.49748743718592964,7,6,0.934,0.9174,0.13675213675213677,0.162,0.18452380952380953,0.8388,0.6752,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,The Venture Capital Squeeze.txt,"November 2005
In the next few years, venture capital funds will find themselves
squeezed from four directions. They're already stuck with a seller's
market, because of the huge amounts they raised at the end of the
Bubble and still haven't invested. This by itself is not the end
of the world. In fact, it's just a more extreme version of the
norm
in the VC business: too much money chasing too few deals. Unfortunately, those few deals now want less and less money, because
it's getting so cheap to start a startup. The four causes: open
source, which makes software free; Moore's law, which makes hardware
geometrically closer to free; the Web, which makes promotion free
if you're good; and better languages, which make development a lot
cheaper. When we started our startup in 1995, the first three were our biggest
expenses. We had to pay $5000 for the Netscape Commerce Server,
the only software that then supported secure http connections. We
paid $3000 for a server with a 90 MHz processor and 32 meg of
memory. And we paid a PR firm about $30,000 to promote our launch. Now you could get all three for nothing. You can get the software
for free; people throw away computers more powerful than our first
server; and if you make something good you can generate ten times
as much traffic by word of mouth online than our first PR firm got
through the print media. And of course another big change for the average startup is that
programming languages have improved-- or rather, the median language has. At most startups ten years
ago, software development meant ten programmers writing code in
C++. Now the same work might be done by one or two using Python
or Ruby. During the Bubble, a lot of people predicted that startups would
outsource their development to India. I think a better model for
the future is David Heinemeier Hansson, who outsourced his development
to a more powerful language instead. A lot of well-known applications
are now, like BaseCamp, written by just one programmer. And one
guy is more than 10x cheaper than ten, because (a) he won't waste
any time in meetings, and (b) since he's probably a founder, he can
pay himself nothing. Because starting a startup is so cheap, venture capitalists now
often want to give startups more money than the startups want to
take. VCs like to invest several million at a time. But as one
VC told me after a startup he funded would only take about half a
million, ""I don't know what we're going to do. Maybe we'll just
have to give some of it back."" Meaning give some of the fund back
to the institutional investors who supplied it, because it wasn't
going to be possible to invest it all. Into this already bad situation comes the third problem: Sarbanes-Oxley. Sarbanes-Oxley is a law, passed after the Bubble, that drastically
increases the regulatory burden on public companies.","And in addition to the cost of compliance, which is at least two million dollars a year, the law introduces frightening legal exposure for corporate officers. An experienced CFO I know said flatly: ""I would not want to be CFO of a public company now."" You might think that responsible corporate governance is an area where you can't go too far. But you can go too far in any law, and this remark convinced me that Sarbanes-Oxley must have. This CFO is both the smartest and the most upstanding money guy I know. If Sarbanes-Oxley deters people like him from being CFOs of public companies, that's proof enough that it's broken. Largely because of Sarbanes-Oxley, few startups go public now. For all practical purposes, succeeding now equals getting bought. Which means VCs are now in the business of finding promising little 2-3 man startups and pumping them up into companies that cost $100 million to acquire. They didn't mean to be in this business; it's just what their business has evolved into. Hence the fourth problem: the acquirers have begun to realize they can buy wholesale. Why should they wait for VCs to make the startups they want more expensive? Most of what the VCs add, acquirers don't want anyway. The acquirers already have brand recognition and HR departments. What they really want is the software and the developers, and that's what the startup is in the early phase: concentrated software and developers. Google, typically, seems to have been the first to figure this out. ""Bring us your startups early,"" said Google's speaker at the Startup School. They're quite explicit about it: they like to acquire startups at just the point where they would do a Series A round. (The Series A round is the first round of real VC funding; it usually happens in the first year.) It is a brilliant strategy, and one that other big technology companies will no doubt try to duplicate. Unless they want to have still more of their lunch eaten by Google. Of course, Google has an advantage in buying startups: a lot of the people there are rich, or expect to be when their options vest. Ordinary employees find it very hard to recommend an acquisition; it's just too annoying to see a bunch of twenty year olds get rich when you're still working for salary. Even if it's the right thing for your company to do. The Solution(s) Bad as things look now, there is a way for VCs to save themselves. They need to do two things, one of which won't surprise them, and another that will seem an anathema. Let's start with the obvious one: lobby to get Sarbanes-Oxley loosened. This law was created to prevent future Enrons, not to destroy the IPO market. Since the IPO market was practically dead when it passed, few saw what bad effects it would have. But now that technology has recovered from the last bust, we can see clearly what a bottleneck","The result is that it's getting harder to go public. That's bad news for startups that want to go public, but
even worse for those that want to go private. Because for a private company, you have to get the
consent of the majority of the shareholders to get a new
shareholder in. That's the same as getting the majority of the
shareholders to agree to a new shareholder. So if you want to raise money, you have to get the majority to agree
to a new shareholder. Which is a lot harder than getting a new shareholder
in the first place. So the result is that private companies are now having a hard time
raising capital. In fact, the article says that the number of private companies that
have raised money in the past five years is down by 30% compared to the
previous five years. That's not good. So, to recap, the four problems are: (1) too much money chasing too few deals; (2) deals are getting smaller and smaller; (3) it's getting harder to go public; and (4) it's getting harder to raise private capital. So what's the solution? The solution is to be the one person who can take a lot of money
and turn it into something. The solution is to be a founder, not an investor. The solution is to build something that is so valuable that even
if you don't get a lot of money, you can still make a lot of money. The solution is to be a founder, not an investor. The solution is to be a founder, not an investor. The solution is to be a founder, not an investor. The solution is to be a founder, not an investor. The solution is to be a founder, not an investing.

Paul Graham,The Pooled-Risk Company Management Company.txt,"July 2008
At this year's startup school, David Heinemeier Hansson gave a
talk
in which he suggested that startup founders
should do things the old fashioned way. Instead of hoping to get
rich by building a valuable company and then selling stock in a
""liquidity event,"" founders should start companies that make money
and live off the revenues. Sounds like a good plan. Let's think about the optimal way to do
this. One disadvantage of living off the revenues of your company is that
you have to keep running it. And as anyone who runs their own
business can tell you, that requires your complete attention. You
can't just start a business and check out once things are going
well, or they stop going well surprisingly fast. The main economic motives of startup founders seem to be freedom
and security. They want enough money that (a) they don't have to
worry about running out of money and (b) they can spend their time
how they want. Running your own business offers neither. You
certainly don't have freedom: no boss is so demanding. Nor do you
have security, because if you stop paying attention to the company,
its revenues go away, and with them your income. The best case, for most people, would be if you could hire someone
to manage the company for you once you'd grown it to a certain size. Suppose you could find a really good manager. Then you would have
both freedom and security. You could pay as little attention to
the business as you wanted, knowing that your manager would keep
things running smoothly. And that being so, revenues would continue
to flow in, so you'd have security as well. There will of course be some founders who wouldn't like that idea:
the ones who like running their company so much that there's nothing
else they'd rather do. But this group must be small. The way you
succeed in most businesses is to be fanatically attentive
to customers' needs. What are the odds that your own desires would
coincide exactly with the demands of this powerful, external force? Sure, running your own company can be fairly interesting. Viaweb
was more interesting than any job I'd had before. And since I made
much more money from it, it offered the highest ratio of income to
boringness of anything I'd done, by orders of magnitude. But was
it the most interesting work I could imagine doing? No. Whether the number of founders in the same position is asymptotic
or merely large, there are certainly a lot of them. For them the
right approach would be to hand the company over to a professional
manager eventually, if they could find one who was good enough. _____
So far so good. But what if your manager was hit by a bus? What
you really want is a management company to run your company for
you. Then you don't depend on any one person.","If you own rental property, there are companies you can hire to manage it for you. Some will do everything, from finding tenants to fixing leaks. Of course, running companies is a lot more complicated than managing rental property, but let's suppose there were management companies that could do it for you. They'd charge a lot, but wouldn't it be worth it? I'd sacrifice a large percentage of the income for the extra peace of mind. I realize what I'm describing already sounds too good to be true, but I can think of a way to make it even more attractive. If company management companies existed, there would be an additional service they could offer clients: they could let them insure their returns by pooling their risk. After all, even a perfect manager can't save a company when, as sometimes happens, its whole market dies, just as property managers can't save you from the building burning down. But a company that managed a large enough number of companies could say to all its clients: we'll combine the revenues from all your companies, and pay you your proportionate share. If such management companies existed, they'd offer the maximum of freedom and security. Someone would run your company for you, and you'd be protected even if it happened to die. Let's think about how such a management company might be organized. The simplest way would be to have a new kind of stock representing the total pool of companies they were managing. When you signed up, you'd trade your company's stock for shares of this pool, in proportion to an estimate of your company's value that you'd both agreed upon. Then you'd automatically get your share of the returns of the whole pool. The catch is that because this kind of trade would be hard to undo, you couldn't switch management companies. But there's a way they could fix that: suppose all the company management companies got together and agreed to allow their clients to exchange shares in all their pools. Then you could, in effect, simultaneously choose all the management companies to run yours for you, in whatever proportion you wanted, and change your mind later as often as you wanted. If such pooled-risk company management companies existed, signing up with one would seem the ideal plan for most people following the route David advocated. Good news: they do exist. What I've just described is an acquisition by a public company. _____ Unfortunately, though public acquirers are structurally identical to pooled-risk company management companies, they don't think of themselves that way. With a property management company, you can just walk in whenever you want and say ""manage my rental property for me"" and they'll do it. Whereas acquirers are, as of this writing, extremely fickle. Sometimes they're in a buying mood and they'll overpay enormously; other times they're not interested. They're like property management companies run by madmen. Or more precisely, by Benjamin Graham's Mr. Market. So while on average public","But management
companies are not easy to find. They are not just any company
that can manage your business. You need a management company that
has the experience, the knowledge, and the resources to manage
your business effectively. This is a high bar. So what if you don't have a management company? Then what? Then you need to have a
business that is not only profitable, but also is able to
continue to generate revenues even if the founder is not around. So the question is, can a company be run without a founder?
That is the big question. In the world of startups, the idea that a company can be run without
a founder is a strange notion. The idea is that the
company is built by a founder. But the company is run by the
founders. But that is not the case. The company is built by the
founders, but it is run by the employees. So, in this sense, the
company is run by others, not by the founder. So, if the founder is
not around, the company can still be run. So, in that sense, a company can be run without a founder. But in the world of startups, the company is not yet run. It is in the process of being built. So, the idea of a company that is run without a founder is
not a realistic one. So, what is the alternative? You need to have a
company that is run by employees. But that is not the case. It is not
yet run. So, the alternative is that you need to have a business that is
not only profitable, but also has some sort of self-sustaining
structure. So, if the founder is not around, the business can still be
run. This is the ideal scenario. But it is not easy. So, the key to the startup is not only to build a
business, but to build a",494,500,325,0.3145,0.2221,0.987,0.8677,0.8702,0.7117,2.3631,-4.5679,0.4171,0.3434,0.0609,0.0382,0.012,0.0033,0.3924,0.5594,0.9861,0.9438,0.45229681978798586,0.41836734693877553,0.550531914893617,7,4,0.9533,0.92,0.145748987854251,0.182,0.16,0.9583,0.4895,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,Don't Talk to Corp Dev.txt,"January 2015
Corporate Development, aka corp dev, is the group within companies
that buys other companies. If you're talking to someone from corp
dev, that's why, whether you realize it yet or not. It's usually a mistake to talk to corp dev unless (a) you want to
sell your company right now and (b) you're sufficiently likely to
get an offer at an acceptable price. In practice that means startups
should only talk to corp dev when they're either doing really well
or really badly. If you're doing really badly, meaning the company
is about to die, you may as well talk to them, because you have
nothing to lose. And if you're doing really well, you can safely
talk to them, because you both know the price will have to be high,
and if they show the slightest sign of wasting your time, you'll
be confident enough to tell them to get lost. The danger is to companies in the middle. Particularly to young
companies that are growing fast, but haven't been doing it for long
enough to have grown big yet. It's usually a mistake for a promising
company less than a year old even to talk to corp dev. But it's a mistake founders constantly make. When someone from
corp dev wants to meet, the founders tell themselves they should
at least find out what they want. Besides, they don't want to
offend Big Company by refusing to meet. Well, I'll tell you what they want. They want to talk about buying
you. That's what the title ""corp dev"" means. So before agreeing
to meet with someone from corp dev, ask yourselves, ""Do we want to
sell the company right now?"" And if the answer is no, tell them
""Sorry, but we're focusing on growing the company."" They won't be
offended. And certainly the founders of Big Company won't be
offended. If anything they'll think more highly of you. You'll
remind them of themselves. They didn't sell either; that's why
they're in a position now to buy other companies. [1]
Most founders who get contacted by corp dev already know what it
means. And yet even when they know what corp dev does and know
they don't want to sell, they take the meeting. Why do they do it? The same mix of denial and wishful thinking that underlies most
mistakes founders make. It's flattering to talk to someone who wants
to buy you. And who knows, maybe their offer will be surprisingly
high. You should at least see what it is, right? No. If they were going to send you an offer immediately by email,
sure, you might as well open it. But that is not how conversations
with corp dev work. If you get an offer at all, it will be at the
end of a long and unbelievably distracting process. And if the
offer is surprising, it will be surprisingly low. Distractions are the thing you can least afford in a startup.","And conversations with corp dev are the worst sort of distraction, because as well as consuming your attention they undermine your morale. One of the tricks to surviving a grueling process is not to stop and think how tired you are. Instead you get into a sort of flow. [2] Imagine what it would do to you if at mile 20 of a marathon, someone ran up beside you and said ""You must feel really tired. Would you like to stop and take a rest?"" Conversations with corp dev are like that but worse, because the suggestion of stopping gets combined in your mind with the imaginary high price you think they'll offer. And then you're really in trouble. If they can, corp dev people like to turn the tables on you. They like to get you to the point where you're trying to convince them to buy instead of them trying to convince you to sell. And surprisingly often they succeed. This is a very slippery slope, greased with some of the most powerful forces that can work on founders' minds, and attended by an experienced professional whose full time job is to push you down it. Their tactics in pushing you down that slope are usually fairly brutal. Corp dev people's whole job is to buy companies, and they don't even get to choose which. The only way their performance is measured is by how cheaply they can buy you, and the more ambitious ones will stop at nothing to achieve that. For example, they'll almost always start with a lowball offer, just to see if you'll take it. Even if you don't, a low initial offer will demoralize you and make you easier to manipulate. And that is the most innocent of their tactics. Just wait till you've agreed on a price and think you have a done deal, and then they come back and say their boss has vetoed the deal and won't do it for more than half the agreed upon price. Happens all the time. If you think investors can behave badly, it's nothing compared to what corp dev people can do. Even corp dev people at companies that are otherwise benevolent. I remember once complaining to a friend at Google about some nasty trick their corp dev people had pulled on a YC startup. ""What happened to Don't be Evil?"" I asked. ""I don't think corp dev got the memo,"" he replied. The tactics you encounter in M&A conversations can be like nothing you've experienced in the otherwise comparatively upstanding world of Silicon Valley. It's as if a chunk of genetic material from the old-fashioned robber baron business world got incorporated into the startup world. [3] The simplest way to protect yourself is to use the trick that John D. Rockefeller, whose grandfather was an alcoholic, used to protect himself from becoming one. He once told a Sunday school class Boys, do you know why I never became a drunkard? Because I never","And
low offers are the thing you can least afford. So the only time you should
talk to corp dev is when you're in a position to be very
confident that you can outprice them. The only time you're in that position is when your company is
doing really well. And when you're doing really well, you can afford to say
no. The founders of Big Company are in a position to buy
because they are not doing well. They are not doing well, which is why they're buying other
companies. So if you're doing well, you can safely say no, and you
can even say it with confidence. If you're not doing well, you can't afford to say no. That's the key. If you're not doing well, you can't afford to say no. So if you're doing badly, you might as well talk to them. But if you're doing badly, you're not in a position to outprice
them. So you might as well talk to them, but you have nothing to
lose. That's the key. If you're not doing well, you can't afford to say no. If you're not doing well, you can't afford to say no. That's the key. [2]

The article above is a great example of the kind of thing I want to write. It's not a technical article, but it's not just a general essay either. It's something that is at once a personal reflection, an argument, and a piece of advice. The article is about a very specific topic: corporate development. It's written by someone with some experience in the field, but not necessarily in the corporate development field. The tone is conversational, with some humor and irony, and it's full of personal anecdotes and opinions. The article is also filled with specific examples and concrete advice.

Paul Graham,How to Be Silicon Valley.txt,"May 2006
(This essay is derived from a keynote at Xtech.)
Could you reproduce Silicon Valley elsewhere, or is there something
unique about it? It wouldn't be surprising if it were hard to reproduce in other
countries, because you couldn't reproduce it in most of the US
either. What does it take to make a silicon valley even here? What it takes is the right people. If you could get the right ten
thousand people to move from Silicon Valley to Buffalo, Buffalo
would become Silicon Valley. [1]
That's a striking departure from the past. Up till a couple decades
ago, geography was destiny for cities. All great cities were located
on waterways, because cities made money by trade, and water was the
only economical way to ship. Now you could make a great city anywhere, if you could get the right
people to move there. So the question of how to make a silicon
valley becomes: who are the right people, and how do you get them
to move? Two Types
I think you only need two kinds of people to create a technology
hub: rich people and nerds. They're the limiting reagents in the
reaction that produces startups, because they're the only ones
present when startups get started. Everyone else will move. Observation bears this out: within the US, towns have become startup
hubs if and only if they have both rich people and nerds. Few
startups happen in Miami, for example, because although it's full
of rich people, it has few nerds. It's not the kind of place nerds
like. Whereas Pittsburgh has the opposite problem: plenty of nerds, but
no rich people. The top US Computer Science departments are said
to be MIT, Stanford, Berkeley, and Carnegie-Mellon. MIT yielded
Route 128. Stanford and Berkeley yielded Silicon Valley. But
Carnegie-Mellon? The record skips at that point. Lower down the
list, the University of Washington yielded a high-tech community
in Seattle, and the University of Texas at Austin yielded one in
Austin. But what happened in Pittsburgh? And in Ithaca, home of
Cornell, which is also high on the list? I grew up in Pittsburgh and went to college at Cornell, so I can
answer for both. The weather is terrible, particularly in winter,
and there's no interesting old city to make up for it, as there is
in Boston. Rich people don't want to live in Pittsburgh or Ithaca. So while there are plenty of hackers who could start startups,
there's no one to invest in them. Not Bureaucrats
Do you really need the rich people? Wouldn't it work to have the
government invest in the nerds? No, it would not. Startup investors
are a distinct type of rich people. They tend to have a lot of
experience themselves in the technology business. This (a) helps
them pick the right startups, and (b) means they can supply advice
and connections as well as money.","And the fact that they have a personal stake in the outcome makes them really pay attention. Bureaucrats by their nature are the exact opposite sort of people from startup investors. The idea of them making startup investments is comic. It would be like mathematicians running Vogue-- or perhaps more accurately, Vogue editors running a math journal. [2] Though indeed, most things bureaucrats do, they do badly. We just don't notice usually, because they only have to compete against other bureaucrats. But as startup investors they'd have to compete against pros with a great deal more experience and motivation. Even corporations that have in-house VC groups generally forbid them to make their own investment decisions. Most are only allowed to invest in deals where some reputable private VC firm is willing to act as lead investor. Not Buildings If you go to see Silicon Valley, what you'll see are buildings. But it's the people that make it Silicon Valley, not the buildings. I read occasionally about attempts to set up ""technology parks"" in other places, as if the active ingredient of Silicon Valley were the office space. An article about Sophia Antipolis bragged that companies there included Cisco, Compaq, IBM, NCR, and Nortel. Don't the French realize these aren't startups? Building office buildings for technology companies won't get you a silicon valley, because the key stage in the life of a startup happens before they want that kind of space. The key stage is when they're three guys operating out of an apartment. Wherever the startup is when it gets funded, it will stay. The defining quality of Silicon Valley is not that Intel or Apple or Google have offices there, but that they were started there. So if you want to reproduce Silicon Valley, what you need to reproduce is those two or three founders sitting around a kitchen table deciding to start a company. And to reproduce that you need those people. Universities The exciting thing is, all you need are the people. If you could attract a critical mass of nerds and investors to live somewhere, you could reproduce Silicon Valley. And both groups are highly mobile. They'll go where life is good. So what makes a place good to them? What nerds like is other nerds. Smart people will go wherever other smart people are. And in particular, to great universities. In theory there could be other ways to attract them, but so far universities seem to be indispensable. Within the US, there are no technology hubs without first-rate universities-- or at least, first-rate computer science departments. So if you want to make a silicon valley, you not only need a university, but one of the top handful in the world. It has to be good enough to act as a magnet, drawing the best people from thousands of miles away. And that means it has to stand up to existing magnets like MIT and Stanford. This sounds hard. Actually it might be easy. My professor","Governments can't do that.
They don't have the experience. They can't do that. Even if they could, they wouldn't. Because they are
not in the business of creating startups. They are in the business
of creating laws. They are in the business of creating laws. So governments are not the right people. Not Bureaucrats
The government is not the right people. The right people are the
rich people who are in the business of creating startups. So the
question is, how do you get rich people to come to a place?
How do you get them to move? The answer is that you need a
culture that is in favor of the rich people. You need a culture that
values the rich people. You need a culture that is in favor of the
rich people. The first step is to get rich people to come to a place. The second step is to get nerds to come to a place. But how do you get both of them to come? How do you get the right people to move? How do you get the right people to move? The answer is that you need a culture that is in favor of the
rich people and the nerds. You need a culture that is in favor of the rich people and the nerds. You need a culture that is in favor of the rich people and the nerds. So the key is not just to get the right people to move, but to get the
right culture to move. It's not just the people, but the culture. The culture is
what makes the people move. So in order to make a Silicon Valley, you have to make a culture that
is in favor of both the rich people and the nerds. The culture that is in favor of both the rich people and the nerds. [2]
The culture is not something that can be easily copied. It's a
collective, social, and psychological phenomenon.",487,500,332,0.3675,0.459,0.9815,0.9303,0.9785,0.8096,0.3056,-2.65,0.4365,0.4524,0.0715,0.1308,0.0112,0.0457,0.5152,0.5478,0.983,0.9693,0.4118673647469459,0.42160278745644597,0.5225464190981433,7,7,0.9627,0.8722,0.18480492813141683,0.158,0.1355421686746988,0.8674,0.4393,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,How to Do Philosophy.txt,"September 2007
In high school I decided I was going to study philosophy in college. I had several motives, some more honorable than others. One of the
less honorable was to shock people. College was regarded as job
training where I grew up, so studying philosophy seemed an impressively
impractical thing to do. Sort of like slashing holes in your clothes
or putting a safety pin through your ear, which were other forms
of impressive impracticality then just coming into fashion. But I had some more honest motives as well. I thought studying
philosophy would be a shortcut straight to wisdom. All the people
majoring in other things would just end up with a bunch of domain
knowledge. I would be learning what was really what. I'd tried to read a few philosophy books. Not recent ones; you
wouldn't find those in our high school library. But I tried to
read Plato and Aristotle. I doubt I believed I understood them,
but they sounded like they were talking about something important. I assumed I'd learn what in college. The summer before senior year I took some college classes. I learned
a lot in the calculus class, but I didn't learn much in Philosophy
101. And yet my plan to study philosophy remained intact. It was
my fault I hadn't learned anything. I hadn't read the books we
were assigned carefully enough. I'd give Berkeley's Principles
of Human Knowledge another shot in college. Anything so admired
and so difficult to read must have something in it, if one could
only figure out what. Twenty-six years later, I still don't understand Berkeley. I have
a nice edition of his collected works. Will I ever read it? Seems
unlikely. The difference between then and now is that now I understand why
Berkeley is probably not worth trying to understand. I think I see
now what went wrong with philosophy, and how we might fix it. Words
I did end up being a philosophy major for most of college. It
didn't work out as I'd hoped. I didn't learn any magical truths
compared to which everything else was mere domain knowledge. But
I do at least know now why I didn't. Philosophy doesn't really
have a subject matter in the way math or history or most other
university subjects do. There is no core of knowledge one must
master. The closest you come to that is a knowledge of what various
individual philosophers have said about different topics over the
years. Few were sufficiently correct that people have forgotten
who discovered what they discovered. Formal logic has some subject matter. I took several classes in
logic. I don't know if I learned anything from them. [1]
It does seem to me very important to be able to flip ideas around in
one's head: to see when two ideas don't fully cover the space of
possibilities, or when one idea is the same as another but with a
couple things changed.","But did studying logic teach me the importance of thinking this way, or make me any better at it? I don't know. There are things I know I learned from studying philosophy. The most dramatic I learned immediately, in the first semester of freshman year, in a class taught by Sydney Shoemaker. I learned that I don't exist. I am (and you are) a collection of cells that lurches around driven by various forces, and calls itself I. But there's no central, indivisible thing that your identity goes with. You could conceivably lose half your brain and live. Which means your brain could conceivably be split into two halves and each transplanted into different bodies. Imagine waking up after such an operation. You have to imagine being two people. The real lesson here is that the concepts we use in everyday life are fuzzy, and break down if pushed too hard. Even a concept as dear to us as I. It took me a while to grasp this, but when I did it was fairly sudden, like someone in the nineteenth century grasping evolution and realizing the story of creation they'd been told as a child was all wrong. [2] Outside of math there's a limit to how far you can push words; in fact, it would not be a bad definition of math to call it the study of terms that have precise meanings. Everyday words are inherently imprecise. They work well enough in everyday life that you don't notice. Words seem to work, just as Newtonian physics seems to. But you can always make them break if you push them far enough. I would say that this has been, unfortunately for philosophy, the central fact of philosophy. Most philosophical debates are not merely afflicted by but driven by confusions over words. Do we have free will? Depends what you mean by ""free."" Do abstract ideas exist? Depends what you mean by ""exist."" Wittgenstein is popularly credited with the idea that most philosophical controversies are due to confusions over language. I'm not sure how much credit to give him. I suspect a lot of people realized this, but reacted simply by not studying philosophy, rather than becoming philosophy professors. How did things get this way? Can something people have spent thousands of years studying really be a waste of time? Those are interesting questions. In fact, some of the most interesting questions you can ask about philosophy. The most valuable way to approach the current philosophical tradition may be neither to get lost in pointless speculations like Berkeley, nor to shut them down like Wittgenstein, but to study it as an example of reason gone wrong. History Western philosophy really begins with Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. What we know of their predecessors comes from fragments and references in later works; their doctrines could be described as speculative cosmology that occasionally strays into analysis. Presumably they were driven by whatever makes people in every other society invent cosmologies. [3] With","But I don't know if that's the point of logic, or if it's
just a side effect. I don't think the point is to be able to think more clearly. I think it's more about the structure of thought. If you can see the structure, you can see what is missing. You can see where ideas overlap, where they diverge, where they
are redundant. That's more the point of logic than just being able to
reason more clearly. The point is to understand how ideas are related. The point is to understand the structure of the mind. It's not about being clear. It's about being systematic. The point of studying logic is not to be able to reason better, but to be able to see the structure of the mind. I think that's the point of philosophy. The point of philosophy is to understand the structure of the mind, and to see how ideas are related. That's the point of philosophy. So the point of studying philosophy is not to learn about the world, but to understand how to think. And that is why philosophy is so different from other subjects. Philosophy is not about finding truths about the world. It's about finding truths about how the mind works. The point of philosophy is to understand the structure of the mind. [2]
I think that the problem with philosophy is that it's not clear what the point is. If you can't see the point of something, you can't be motivated to do it. So if you can't see the point of philosophy, you can't be motivated to do it. That's why so many people give up on it. They don't see the point. And that's why so many people have trouble with it. They don't see the point. But if you can see the point, you can be motivated to do it. And you can see how it's useful. The point of philosophy is to understand the structure of the mind.

Paul Graham,Why to Move to a Startup Hub.txt,"October 2007
After the last
talk I gave, one of the organizers
got up on the
stage to deliver an impromptu rebuttal. That never happened before. I only heard the first few sentences, but that was enough to tell
what I said that upset him: that startups would do better if they
moved to Silicon Valley. This conference was in London, and most of the audience seemed to
be from the UK. So saying startups should move to Silicon Valley
seemed like a nationalistic remark: an obnoxious American telling
them that if they wanted to do things right they should all just
move to America. Actually I'm less American than I seem. I didn't say so, but I'm
British by birth. And just as Jews are ex officio allowed to tell
Jewish jokes, I don't feel like I have to bother being diplomatic
with a British audience. The idea that startups would do better to move to Silicon Valley
is not even a nationalistic one. [1]
It's the same thing I say to
startups in the US. Y Combinator alternates between coasts every
6 months. Every other funding cycle is in Boston. And even though
Boston is the second biggest startup hub in the US (and the world),
we tell the startups from those cycles that their best bet is to
move to Silicon Valley. If that's true of Boston, it's even more
true of every other city. This is about cities, not countries. And I think I can prove I'm right. You can easily reduce the
opposing argument ad what most people would agree was absurdum. Few would be willing to claim that it doesn't matter at all where
a startup is—that a startup operating out of a small agricultural
town wouldn't benefit from moving to a startup hub. Most people
could see how it might be helpful to be in a place where there was
infrastructure for startups, accumulated knowledge about how to
make them work, and other people trying to do it. And yet whatever
argument you use to prove that startups don't need to move from
London to Silicon Valley could equally well be used to prove startups
don't need to move from smaller towns to London. The difference between cities is a matter of degree. And if, as
nearly everyone who knows agrees, startups are better off in Silicon
Valley than Boston, then they're better off in Silicon Valley than
everywhere else too. I realize I might seem to have a vested interest in this conclusion,
because startups that move to the US might do it through Y Combinator. But the American startups we've funded will attest that I say the
same thing to them. I'm not claiming of course that every startup has to go to Silicon
Valley to succeed. Just that all other things being equal, the
more of a startup hub a place is, the better startups will do there. But other considerations can outweigh the advantages of moving.","I'm not saying founders with families should uproot them to move halfway around the world; that might be too much of a distraction. Immigration difficulties might be another reason to stay put. Dealing with immigration problems is like raising money: for some reason it seems to consume all your attention. A startup can't afford much of that. One Canadian startup we funded spent about 6 months working on moving to the US. Eventually they just gave up, because they couldn't afford to take so much time away from working on their software. (If another country wanted to establish a rival to Silicon Valley, the single best thing they could do might be to create a special visa for startup founders. US immigration policy is one of Silicon Valley's biggest weaknesses.) If your startup is connected to a specific industry, you may be better off in one of its centers. A startup doing something related to entertainment might want to be in New York or LA. And finally, if a good investor has committed to fund you if you stay where you are, you should probably stay. Finding investors is hard. You generally shouldn't pass up a definite funding offer to move. [2] In fact, the quality of the investors may be the main advantage of startup hubs. Silicon Valley investors are noticeably more aggressive than Boston ones. Over and over, I've seen startups we've funded snatched by west coast investors out from under the noses of Boston investors who saw them first but acted too slowly. At this year's Boston Demo Day, I told the audience that this happened every year, so if they saw a startup they liked, they should make them an offer. And yet within a month it had happened again: an aggressive west coast VC who had met the founder of a YC-funded startup a week before beat out a Boston VC who had known him for years. By the time the Boston VC grasped what was happening, the deal was already gone. Boston investors will admit they're more conservative. Some want to believe this comes from the city's prudent Yankee character. But Occam's razor suggests the truth is less flattering. Boston investors are probably more conservative than Silicon Valley investors for the same reason Chicago investors are more conservative than Boston ones. They don't understand startups as well. West coast investors aren't bolder because they're irresponsible cowboys, or because the good weather makes them optimistic. They're bolder because they know what they're doing. They're the skiers who ski on the diamond slopes. Boldness is the essence of venture investing. The way you get big returns is not by trying to avoid losses, but by trying to ensure you get some of the big hits. And the big hits often look risky at first. Like Facebook. Facebook was started in Boston. Boston VCs had the first shot at them. But they said no, so Facebook moved to Silicon Valley and raised money there. The partner who","For example, if the startup is focused on a particular market,
or if the team is already in a place with a good enough startup
ecosystem, or if the team is already in a place that has good
business experience. So the idea that startups should move to Silicon Valley isn't a
slogan that should be taken as a mandate. But I do think that the
opposite is a very bad idea. If you have a startup, and you think that the best place to be is
not in a startup hub, then you're probably wrong. It's very rare that a
startup that isn't in a hub will be able to compete with one that
is. The only time it might work is if the startup is in a market that's
not served by any hubs. So the conclusion is that startups should move to a startup hub. But not the one in Silicon Valley. Because there are many more than that. So what's the right one to move to? I don't know. I think the answer is
that it's not about the city, but about the startup. You have to
find a place that's a good fit for your startup. The right place
might be London, or Berlin, or anywhere else that has a good
ecosystem. So, the advice is not to move to Silicon Valley, but to move to
a place that has the right ecosystem for your startup. That's the real
message. [2]

Paul Graham,How to Convince Investors.txt,"Want to start a startup? Get funded by
Y Combinator. August 2013
When people hurt themselves lifting heavy things, it's usually
because they try to lift with their back. The right way to lift
heavy things is to let your legs do the work. Inexperienced founders
make the same mistake when trying to convince investors. They try
to convince with their pitch. Most would be better off if they let
their startup do the work — if they started by understanding why
their startup is worth investing in, then simply explained this
well to investors. Investors are looking for startups that will be very successful. But that test is not as simple as it sounds. In startups, as in a
lot of other domains, the distribution of outcomes follows a power
law, but in startups the curve is startlingly steep. The big
successes are so big they
dwarf the rest. And since there are only
a handful each year (the conventional wisdom is 15), investors treat
""big success"" as if it were binary. Most are interested in you if
you seem like you have a chance, however small, of being one of the
15 big successes, and otherwise not. [1]
(There are a handful of angels who'd be interested in a company
with a high probability of being moderately successful. But angel
investors like big successes too.)
How do you seem like you'll be one of the big successes? You need
three things: formidable founders, a promising market, and (usually)
some evidence of success so far. Formidable
The most important ingredient is formidable founders. Most investors
decide in the first few minutes whether you seem like a winner or
a loser, and once their opinion is set it's hard to change. [2]
Every startup has reasons both to invest and not to invest. If
investors think you're a winner they focus on the former, and if
not they focus on the latter. For example, it might be a rich
market, but with a slow sales cycle. If investors are impressed
with you as founders, they say they want to invest because it's a
rich market, and if not, they say they can't invest because of the
slow sales cycle. They're not necessarily trying to mislead you. Most investors are
genuinely unclear in their own minds why they like or dislike
startups. If you seem like a winner, they'll like your idea more. But don't be too smug about this weakness of theirs, because you
have it too; almost everyone does. There is a role for ideas of course. They're fuel for the fire
that starts with liking the founders. Once investors like you,
you'll see them reaching for ideas: they'll be saying ""yes, and you
could also do x."" (Whereas when they don't like you, they'll be
saying ""but what about y?"")
But the foundation of convincing investors is to seem formidable,
and since this isn't a word most people use in conversation much,
I should explain what it means.","A formidable person is one who seems like they'll get what they want, regardless of whatever obstacles are in the way. Formidable is close to confident, except that someone could be confident and mistaken. Formidable is roughly justifiably confident. There are a handful of people who are really good at seeming formidable — some because they actually are very formidable and just let it show, and others because they are more or less con artists. [3] But most founders, including many who will go on to start very successful companies, are not that good at seeming formidable the first time they try fundraising. What should they do? [4] What they should not do is try to imitate the swagger of more experienced founders. Investors are not always that good at judging technology, but they're good at judging confidence. If you try to act like something you're not, you'll just end up in an uncanny valley. You'll depart from sincere, but never arrive at convincing. Truth The way to seem most formidable as an inexperienced founder is to stick to the truth. How formidable you seem isn't a constant. It varies depending on what you're saying. Most people can seem confident when they're saying ""one plus one is two,"" because they know it's true. The most diffident person would be puzzled and even slightly contemptuous if they told a VC ""one plus one is two"" and the VC reacted with skepticism. The magic ability of people who are good at seeming formidable is that they can do this with the sentence ""we're going to make a billion dollars a year."" But you can do the same, if not with that sentence with some fairly impressive ones, so long as you convince yourself first. That's the secret. Convince yourself that your startup is worth investing in, and then when you explain this to investors they'll believe you. And by convince yourself, I don't mean play mind games with yourself to boost your confidence. I mean truly evaluate whether your startup is worth investing in. If it isn't, don't try to raise money. [5] But if it is, you'll be telling the truth when you tell investors it's worth investing in, and they'll sense that. You don't have to be a smooth presenter if you understand something well and tell the truth about it. To evaluate whether your startup is worth investing in, you have to be a domain expert. If you're not a domain expert, you can be as convinced as you like about your idea, and it will seem to investors no more than an instance of the Dunning-Kruger effect. Which in fact it will usually be. And investors can tell fairly quickly whether you're a domain expert by how well you answer their questions. Know everything about your market. [6] Why do founders persist in trying to convince investors of things they're not convinced of themselves? Partly because we've all been trained to. When my friends Robert Morris and Trevor","The most important quality for founders is
not being afraid of hard work. If you are afraid of hard work, you
will not be a formidable founder. If you are not afraid of hard work, then you
might be a formidable founder. But it's not enough to be fearless. You have to be
able to take action. If you're not afraid of hard work, but you
can't do anything, then you're not a formidable founder. The
point is that you have to be able to start doing things right
away. This is what makes the difference between a
founder who is not afraid of hard work but can't get started, and a
founder who is not afraid of hard work and can get started. It's not that the second type of founder is more
intelligent. It's that they can be
intelligent, but they can also be
relatively stupid. But they can do things. The second type of founder can be a
smart person with a
great idea, but they can also be a
dumb person with a great idea. The point is that they can do things. The first type of founder is a smart person who
is not afraid of hard work, but can't get started. But if they are
smart, they can get started. But if they are not smart, they
can't get started. So, in the end, the most important thing is that you
can do things. It's not that you're smart. It's that you can do things. The most important quality for a
founder is not being afraid of hard work. The second is being able to
take action. The third is being able to
make decisions. And the fourth is having a good
idea. But the order is important. You have to be able to do things first, then you can
make decisions, then you can have a good idea.

Paul Graham,Writing and Speaking.txt,"March 2012
I'm not a very good speaker. I say ""um"" a lot. Sometimes I have
to pause when I lose my train of thought. I wish I were a better
speaker. But I don't wish I were a better speaker like I wish I
were a better writer. What I really want is to have good ideas,
and that's a much bigger part of being a good writer than being a
good speaker. Having good ideas is most of writing well. If you know what you're
talking about, you can say it in the plainest words and you'll be
perceived as having a good style. With speaking it's the opposite:
having good ideas is an alarmingly small component of being a good
speaker. I first noticed this at a conference several years ago. There was another speaker who was much better than me. He had all of us roaring with laughter. I seemed awkward and
halting by comparison. Afterward I put my talk online like I usually
do. As I was doing it I tried to imagine what a transcript of the
other guy's talk would be like, and it was only then I realized he
hadn't said very much. Maybe this would have been obvious to someone who knew more about
speaking, but it was a revelation to me how much less ideas mattered
in speaking than writing. [1]
A few years later I heard a talk by someone who was not merely a
better speaker than me, but a famous speaker. Boy was he good. So
I decided I'd pay close attention to what he said, to learn how he
did it. After about ten sentences I found myself thinking ""I don't
want to be a good speaker.""
Being a really good speaker is not merely orthogonal to having good ideas,
but in many ways pushes you in the opposite direction. For example,
when I give a talk, I usually write it out beforehand. I know that's
a mistake; I know delivering a
prewritten
talk makes it harder to
engage with an audience. The way to get the attention of an audience
is to give them your full attention, and when you're delivering
a prewritten talk, your attention is always divided between the
audience and the talk — even if you've memorized it. If you want
to engage an audience, it's better to start with no more than an outline
of what you want to say and
ad lib the individual sentences. But
if you do that, you might spend no more time thinking about each
sentence than it takes to say it. [2]
Occasionally the stimulation
of talking to a live audience makes you think of new things, but
in general this is not going to generate ideas as well as writing
does, where you can spend as long on each sentence as you want.","If you rehearse a prewritten speech enough, you can get asymptotically close to the sort of engagement you get when speaking ad lib. Actors do. But here again there's a tradeoff between smoothness and ideas. All the time you spend practicing a talk, you could instead spend making it better. Actors don't face that temptation, except in the rare cases where they've written the script, but any speaker does. Before I give a talk I can usually be found sitting in a corner somewhere with a copy printed out on paper, trying to rehearse it in my head. But I always end up spending most of the time rewriting it instead. Every talk I give ends up being given from a manuscript full of things crossed out and rewritten. Which of course makes me um even more, because I haven't had any time to practice the new bits. [3] Depending on your audience, there are even worse tradeoffs than these. Audiences like to be flattered; they like jokes; they like to be swept off their feet by a vigorous stream of words. As you decrease the intelligence of the audience, being a good speaker is increasingly a matter of being a good bullshitter. That's true in writing too of course, but the descent is steeper with talks. Any given person is dumber as a member of an audience than as a reader. Just as a speaker ad libbing can only spend as long thinking about each sentence as it takes to say it, a person hearing a talk can only spend as long thinking about each sentence as it takes to hear it. Plus people in an audience are always affected by the reactions of those around them, and the reactions that spread from person to person in an audience are disproportionately the more brutish sort, just as low notes travel through walls better than high ones. Every audience is an incipient mob, and a good speaker uses that. Part of the reason I laughed so much at the talk by the good speaker at that conference was that everyone else did. [4] So are talks useless? They're certainly inferior to the written word as a source of ideas. But that's not all talks are good for. When I go to a talk, it's usually because I'm interested in the speaker. Listening to a talk is the closest most of us can get to having a conversation with someone like the president, who doesn't have time to meet individually with all the people who want to meet him. Talks are also good at motivating me to do things. It's probably no coincidence that so many famous speakers are described as motivational speakers. That may be what public speaking is really for. It's probably what it was originally for. The emotional reactions you can elicit with a talk can be a powerful force. I wish I could say that this force was more often used for good than ill, but I'm","[3]
So, in some ways, being a good speaker is not just different from being a good writer — it's the opposite. [4]
And yet, the fact that the speaker is not a writer, and that
speaking is not writing, is a huge part of what makes it possible
to be a good speaker. The speaker is not the writer. The speaker is not the writer. [5]
I think that the key to being a good speaker is to understand that
you're not the author of what you're saying. You are not the author.
You are the messenger. [6]
So when I'm giving a talk, I try to think of myself not as the
author of the talk, but as a messenger. I try to make the message
clear and the message accurate, and the message is the important
thing. [7]
But there's a problem here. If you're the messenger, you can't
always be the messenger. Sometimes, you have to be the author. [8]
So, for example, when I'm writing a book, I have to be the author.
I have to be the author of the book. I have to be the author of the
book, the author of the book, the author of the book. [9]
That's the only way to get the book out of my head and into the
world. [10]
So, in that sense, being a speaker is not the opposite of being a
writer — it's a different role. [11]
But when you're a speaker, you're not the author. You're the
messenger. And when you're a writer, you're the author. [12]
And that's why I think that the key to being a good speaker is to
understand that you're not the author. [13]
I think that is the key. [14]

Paul Graham,Being Popular.txt,"May 2001
(This article was written as a kind of business plan for a
new language. So it is missing (because it takes for granted) the most important
feature of a good programming language: very powerful abstractions.)
A friend of mine once told an eminent operating systems
expert that he wanted to design a really good
programming language. The expert told him that it would be a
waste of time, that programming languages don't become popular
or unpopular based on their merits, and so no matter how
good his language was, no one would use it. At least, that
was what had happened to the language he had designed. What does make a language popular? Do popular
languages deserve their popularity? Is it worth trying to
define a good programming language? How would you do it? I think the answers to these questions can be found by looking
at hackers, and learning what they want. Programming
languages are for hackers, and a programming language
is good as a programming language (rather than, say, an
exercise in denotational semantics or compiler design)
if and only if hackers like it. 1 The Mechanics of Popularity
It's true, certainly, that most people don't choose programming
languages simply based on their merits. Most programmers are told
what language to use by someone else. And yet I think the effect
of such external factors on the popularity of programming languages
is not as great as it's sometimes thought to be. I think a bigger
problem is that a hacker's idea of a good programming language is
not the same as most language designers'. Between the two, the hacker's opinion is the one that matters. Programming languages are not theorems. They're tools, designed
for people, and they have to be designed to suit human strengths
and weaknesses as much as shoes have to be designed for human feet. If a shoe pinches when you put it on, it's a bad shoe, however
elegant it may be as a piece of sculpture. It may be that the majority of programmers can't tell a good language
from a bad one. But that's no different with any other tool. It
doesn't mean that it's a waste of time to try designing a good
language. Expert hackers
can tell a good language when they see
one, and they'll use it. Expert hackers are a tiny minority,
admittedly, but that tiny minority write all the good software,
and their influence is such that the rest of the programmers will
tend to use whatever language they use. Often, indeed, it is not
merely influence but command: often the expert hackers are the very
people who, as their bosses or faculty advisors, tell the other
programmers what language to use.","The opinion of expert hackers is not the only force that determines the relative popularity of programming languages — legacy software (Cobol) and hype (Ada, Java) also play a role — but I think it is the most powerful force over the long term. Given an initial critical mass and enough time, a programming language probably becomes about as popular as it deserves to be. And popularity further separates good languages from bad ones, because feedback from real live users always leads to improvements. Look at how much any popular language has changed during its life. Perl and Fortran are extreme cases, but even Lisp has changed a lot. Lisp 1.5 didn't have macros, for example; these evolved later, after hackers at MIT had spent a couple years using Lisp to write real programs. [1] So whether or not a language has to be good to be popular, I think a language has to be popular to be good. And it has to stay popular to stay good. The state of the art in programming languages doesn't stand still. And yet the Lisps we have today are still pretty much what they had at MIT in the mid-1980s, because that's the last time Lisp had a sufficiently large and demanding user base. Of course, hackers have to know about a language before they can use it. How are they to hear? From other hackers. But there has to be some initial group of hackers using the language for others even to hear about it. I wonder how large this group has to be; how many users make a critical mass? Off the top of my head, I'd say twenty. If a language had twenty separate users, meaning twenty users who decided on their own to use it, I'd consider it to be real. Getting there can't be easy. I would not be surprised if it is harder to get from zero to twenty than from twenty to a thousand. The best way to get those initial twenty users is probably to use a trojan horse: to give people an application they want, which happens to be written in the new language. 2 External Factors Let's start by acknowledging one external factor that does affect the popularity of a programming language. To become popular, a programming language has to be the scripting language of a popular system. Fortran and Cobol were the scripting languages of early IBM mainframes. C was the scripting language of Unix, and so, later, was Perl. Tcl is the scripting language of Tk. Java and Javascript are intended to be the scripting languages of web browsers. Lisp is not a massively popular language because it is not the scripting language of a massively popular system. What popularity it retains dates back to the 1960s and 1970s, when it was the scripting language of MIT. A lot of the great programmers of the day were associated with MIT at some point. And in the early 1970s, before C,","So, the problem of designing a good programming language is not so
simple as just making it better than the others, but rather
designing it in a way that it is used by expert hackers. The
key is not to make a better language, but to make a language
that is more likely to be used by expert hackers. So, the question becomes, what do expert hackers want in a
programming language? 2 What Do Hackers Want?
Hackers are not a monolithic group. Some of them are
enthusiasts for the idea of making things, and some of them
are just interested in the computer. Some are interested in
the theory of computation, others in the practice of
programming. Some are interested in the beauty of the
language, others in the efficiency of the language, others in the
convenience of the language. But there is a common thread that
runs through all of them. That is, they want to make things. That is, they want to get things done. They want to
make programs, and to make them as easy as possible to
write and to understand. They want to make the things they write
as useful as possible. They want to make the things they write as
powerful as possible. And they want to make the things they write as
efficient as possible. They want to make the things they write as
portable as possible. So, a good programming language is one that allows them to
do all of these things. Now, what is the difference between a language that is
good for making things and one that is not? Well, it's the
ease of writing and understanding the program, the
efficiency of the program, the power of the program, the
portability of the program. These are all things that a good language should
make as easy as possible. A language that is not good for making things is one that
makes these",457,500,323,0.4721,0.3428,0.9747,0.966,0.8699,0.8207,-2.4452,-3.3714,0.4169,0.3676,0.0734,0.0668,0.007,0.0103,0.7931,0.6229,0.9711,0.9678,0.444022770398482,0.4336283185840708,0.5165745856353591,8,7,0.9533,0.9187,0.15317286652078774,0.134,0.12074303405572756,0.9703,0.5893,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,Defining Property.txt,"March 2012
As a child I read a book of stories about a famous judge in eighteenth
century Japan called Ooka Tadasuke. One of the cases he decided
was brought by the owner of a food shop. A poor student who could
afford only rice was eating his rice while enjoying the delicious
cooking smells coming from the food shop. The owner wanted the
student to pay for the smells he was enjoying. The student was
stealing his smells! This story often comes to mind when I hear the RIAA and MPAA accusing
people of stealing music and movies. It sounds ridiculous to us to treat smells as property. But I can
imagine scenarios in which one could charge for smells. Imagine
we were living on a moon base where we had to buy air by the
liter. I could imagine air suppliers adding scents at an extra
charge. The reason it seems ridiculous to us to treat smells as property
is that it wouldn't work to. It would work on a moon base, though. What counts as property depends on what works to treat as property. And that not only can change, but has changed. Humans may always
(for some definition of human and always) have treated small items
carried on one's person as property. But hunter gatherers didn't
treat land, for example, as property in the way we do. [1]
The reason so many people think of property as having a single
unchanging definition is that its definition changes very slowly. [2]
But we are in the midst of such a change now. The record
labels and movie studios used to distribute what they made like air
shipped through tubes on a moon base. But with the arrival of
networks, it's as if we've moved to a planet with a breathable
atmosphere. Data moves like smells now. And through a combination
of wishful thinking and short-term greed, the labels and studios
have put themselves in the position of the food shop owner, accusing
us all of stealing their smells. (The reason I say short-term greed is that the underlying problem
with the labels and studios is that the people who run them are
driven by bonuses rather than equity. If they were driven by equity
they'd be looking for ways to take advantage of technological change
instead of fighting it. But building new things takes too long. Their bonuses depend on this year's revenues, and the best way to
increase those is to extract more money from stuff they do already.)
So what does this mean? Should people not be able to charge for
content? There's not a single yes or no answer to that question. People should be able to charge for content when it works to charge
for content. But by ""works"" I mean something more subtle than ""when they can get
away with it."" I mean when people can charge for content without
warping society in order to do it.","After all, the companies selling smells on the moon base could continue to sell them on the Earth, if they lobbied successfully for laws requiring us all to continue to breathe through tubes down here too, even though we no longer needed to. The crazy legal measures that the labels and studios have been taking have a lot of that flavor. Newspapers and magazines are just as screwed, but they are at least declining gracefully. The RIAA and MPAA would make us breathe through tubes if they could. Ultimately it comes down to common sense. When you're abusing the legal system by trying to use mass lawsuits against randomly chosen people as a form of exemplary punishment, or lobbying for laws that would break the Internet if they passed, that's ipso facto evidence you're using a definition of property that doesn't work. This is where it's helpful to have working democracies and multiple sovereign countries. If the world had a single, autocratic government, the labels and studios could buy laws making the definition of property be whatever they wanted. But fortunately there are still some countries that are not copyright colonies of the US, and even in the US, politicians still seem to be afraid of actual voters, in sufficient numbers. [3] The people running the US may not like it when voters or other countries refuse to bend to their will, but ultimately it's in all our interest that there's not a single point of attack for people trying to warp the law to serve their own purposes. Private property is an extremely useful idea — arguably one of our greatest inventions. So far, each new definition of it has brought us increasing material wealth. [4] It seems reasonable to suppose the newest one will too. It would be a disaster if we all had to keep running an obsolete version just because a few powerful people were too lazy to upgrade. Notes [1] If you want to learn more about hunter gatherers I strongly recommend Elizabeth Marshall Thomas's The Harmless People and The Old Way. [2] Change in the definition of property is driven mostly by technological progress, however, and since technological progress is accelerating, so presumably will the rate of change in the definition of property. Which means it's all the more important for societies to be able to respond gracefully to such changes, because they will come at an ever increasing rate. [3] As far as I know, the term ""copyright colony"" was first used by Myles Peterson. [4] The state of technology isn't simply a function of the definition of property. They each constrain the other. But that being so, you can't mess with the definition of property without affecting (and probably harming) the state of technology. The history of the USSR offers a vivid illustration of that. Thanks to Sam Altman and Geoff Ralston for reading drafts of this.","[3] The problem with the RIAA and MPAA is that they are trying to
make a world in which their property is protected in a way that
warping society is unavoidable. The RIAA and MPAA don't have a
problem with the fact that the people they are trying to protect
are not really property owners. [4] The RIAA and MPAA don't have a problem with the fact that
their methods of protection are not really working. They are just
trying to make a world in which their property is protected in a way that
warping society is unavoidable. So in that sense, they are not trying to protect
their property, but to protect the idea of property. So what do we do? If we have to do something, we have to do it in a way that
doesn't warp society. But we also need to think about how to make the system
work in a way that allows people to make a living. That's a
tough balance to strike. But it's the only way to make the system work in a way that
doesn't warp society. So what's the way to do that? The answer is not to stop the digital revolution. We can't stop it. The answer is not to let people make money off of content that
they don't own. That's not the answer. The answer is to find a way to allow people to make money
off of content that they do own. So how do we do that? It's a question of how to allow people to make money from their
own content, but not from the content of others. So we need to have a system that allows people to be paid for
their content, but not for the content of others. That's the key. The system must allow for the possibility that people can be
paid for their content, but not for the content of others. That's the key",495,485,325,0.2707,0.1919,0.9653,0.9501,0.7333,0.9735,5.7405,-0.4176,0.3827,0.3486,0.0569,0.0604,0.0121,0.01,0.4846,0.2536,0.9817,0.9724,0.44324324324324327,0.427797833935018,0.5501355013550135,6,4,0.9049,0.9307,0.12525252525252525,0.1422680412371134,0.13538461538461538,0.8284,0.5526,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,How to Disagree.txt,"March 2008
The web is turning writing into a conversation. Twenty years ago,
writers wrote and readers read. The web lets readers respond, and
increasingly they do—in comment threads, on forums, and in their
own blog posts. Many who respond to something disagree with it. That's to be
expected. Agreeing tends to motivate people less than disagreeing. And when you agree there's less to say. You could expand on something
the author said, but he has probably already explored the
most interesting implications. When you disagree you're entering
territory he may not have explored. The result is there's a lot more disagreeing going on, especially
measured by the word. That doesn't mean people are getting angrier. The structural change in the way we communicate is enough to account
for it. But though it's not anger that's driving the increase in
disagreement, there's a danger that the increase in disagreement
will make people angrier. Particularly online, where it's easy to
say things you'd never say face to face. If we're all going to be disagreeing more, we should be careful to
do it well. What does it mean to disagree well? Most readers can
tell the difference between mere name-calling and a carefully
reasoned refutation, but I think it would help to put names on the
intermediate stages. So here's an attempt at a disagreement
hierarchy:
DH0. Name-calling. This is the lowest form of disagreement, and probably also the most
common. We've all seen comments like this:
u r a fag!!!!!!!!!! But it's important to realize that more articulate name-calling has
just as little weight. A comment like
The author is a self-important dilettante. is really nothing more than a pretentious version of ""u r a fag.""
DH1. Ad Hominem. An ad hominem attack is not quite as weak as mere name-calling. It
might actually carry some weight. For example, if a senator wrote
an article saying senators' salaries should be increased, one could
respond:
Of course he would say that. He's a senator. This wouldn't refute the author's argument, but it may at least be
relevant to the case. It's still a very weak form of disagreement,
though. If there's something wrong with the senator's argument,
you should say what it is; and if there isn't, what difference does
it make that he's a senator? Saying that an author lacks the authority to write about a topic
is a variant of ad hominem—and a particularly useless sort, because
good ideas often come from outsiders. The question is whether the
author is correct or not. If his lack of authority caused him to
make mistakes, point those out. And if it didn't, it's not a
problem. DH2. Responding to Tone. The next level up we start to see responses to the writing, rather
than the writer. The lowest form of these is to disagree with the
author's tone. E.g. I can't believe the author dismisses intelligent design in such
a cavalier fashion.","Though better than attacking the author, this is still a weak form of disagreement. It matters much more whether the author is wrong or right than what his tone is. Especially since tone is so hard to judge. Someone who has a chip on their shoulder about some topic might be offended by a tone that to other readers seemed neutral. So if the worst thing you can say about something is to criticize its tone, you're not saying much. Is the author flippant, but correct? Better that than grave and wrong. And if the author is incorrect somewhere, say where. DH3. Contradiction. In this stage we finally get responses to what was said, rather than how or by whom. The lowest form of response to an argument is simply to state the opposing case, with little or no supporting evidence. This is often combined with DH2 statements, as in: I can't believe the author dismisses intelligent design in such a cavalier fashion. Intelligent design is a legitimate scientific theory. Contradiction can sometimes have some weight. Sometimes merely seeing the opposing case stated explicitly is enough to see that it's right. But usually evidence will help. DH4. Counterargument. At level 4 we reach the first form of convincing disagreement: counterargument. Forms up to this point can usually be ignored as proving nothing. Counterargument might prove something. The problem is, it's hard to say exactly what. Counterargument is contradiction plus reasoning and/or evidence. When aimed squarely at the original argument, it can be convincing. But unfortunately it's common for counterarguments to be aimed at something slightly different. More often than not, two people arguing passionately about something are actually arguing about two different things. Sometimes they even agree with one another, but are so caught up in their squabble they don't realize it. There could be a legitimate reason for arguing against something slightly different from what the original author said: when you feel they missed the heart of the matter. But when you do that, you should say explicitly you're doing it. DH5. Refutation. The most convincing form of disagreement is refutation. It's also the rarest, because it's the most work. Indeed, the disagreement hierarchy forms a kind of pyramid, in the sense that the higher you go the fewer instances you find. To refute someone you probably have to quote them. You have to find a ""smoking gun,"" a passage in whatever you disagree with that you feel is mistaken, and then explain why it's mistaken. If you can't find an actual quote to disagree with, you may be arguing with a straw man. While refutation generally entails quoting, quoting doesn't necessarily imply refutation. Some writers quote parts of things they disagree with to give the appearance of legitimate refutation, then follow with a response as low as DH3 or even DH0. DH6. Refuting the Central Point. The force of a refutation depends on what you refute. The most powerful form of disagreement is to refute someone's central point.","Or, The author's tone is very condescending. The point of these comments is not to challenge the author's
argument, but to challenge the way the argument is presented. This is
different from ad hominem, which attacks the person, not the
argument. This is a better form of disagreement, but still not a
very good one. DH3. Questioning the Argument. This is a more mature form of disagreement. You don't
just attack the tone, you attack the argument. The goal is to find
flaws in the author's reasoning. This is the kind of disagreement that is
most likely to lead to a meaningful exchange. But it's still
not good enough. DH4. Refuting the Argument. This is the highest level of disagreement. You not only question the
argument, but you actually refute it. You show that the
argument is flawed, and that your own reasoning is better. This is
the kind of disagreement that should be the goal of all online
discourse. But, as I've said, it's not easy. It's not easy to find
flaws in an argument. And it's not easy to come up with a
better argument. The challenge is to do both. The more you can do that, the more you'll be able to
contribute to the conversation. So, the next time you find yourself in disagreement with someone, ask
yourself: am I at DH0, DH1, or DH2? What about DH3 or DH4? Are you
doing the best you can? What's the difference between DH3 and DH4? What is the
main point of the author? What is the author's argument? What is the
evidence? What is the reasoning? If you can answer those questions, you can move up
from DH3 to DH4. And that's the way to disagree well. 1.

Paul Graham,Are Software Patents Evil_.txt,"March 2006
(This essay is derived from a talk at Google.)
A few weeks ago I found to my surprise that I'd been granted four patents. This was all the more surprising
because I'd only applied for three. The patents aren't mine, of
course. They were assigned to Viaweb, and became Yahoo's when they
bought us. But the news set me thinking about the question of
software patents generally. Patents are a hard problem. I've had to advise most of the startups
we've funded about them, and despite years of experience I'm still
not always sure I'm giving the right advice. One thing I do feel pretty certain of is that if you're against
software patents, you're against patents in general. Gradually our
machines consist more and more of software. Things that used to
be done with levers and cams and gears are now done with loops and
trees and closures. There's nothing special about physical embodiments
of control systems that should make them patentable, and the software
equivalent not. Unfortunately, patent law is inconsistent on this point. Patent
law in most countries says that algorithms aren't patentable. This
rule is left over from a time when ""algorithm"" meant something like
the Sieve of Eratosthenes. In 1800, people could not see as readily
as we can that a great many patents on mechanical objects were
really patents on the algorithms they embodied. Patent lawyers still have to pretend that's what they're doing when
they patent algorithms. You must not use the word ""algorithm"" in
the title of a patent application, just as you must not use the
word ""essays"" in the title of a book. If you want to patent an
algorithm, you have to frame it as a computer system executing that algorithm. Then it's mechanical; phew. The default euphemism for algorithm
is ""system and method."" Try a patent search for that phrase and
see how many results you get. Since software patents are no different from hardware patents,
people who say ""software patents are evil"" are saying simply ""patents
are evil."" So why do so many people complain about software patents
specifically? I think the problem is more with the patent office than the concept
of software patents. Whenever software meets government, bad things
happen, because software changes fast and government changes slow. The patent office has been overwhelmed by both the volume and the
novelty of applications for software patents, and as a result they've
made a lot of mistakes. The most common is to grant patents that shouldn't be granted. To
be patentable, an invention has to be more than new. It also has
to be non-obvious. And this, especially, is where the USPTO has
been dropping the ball. Slashdot has an icon that expresses the
problem vividly: a knife and fork with the words ""patent pending""
superimposed. The scary thing is, this is the only icon they have for
patent stories.","Slashdot readers now take it for granted that a story about a patent will be about a bogus patent. That's how bad the problem has become. The problem with Amazon's notorious one-click patent, for example, is not that it's a software patent, but that it's obvious. Any online store that kept people's shipping addresses would have implemented this. The reason Amazon did it first was not that they were especially smart, but because they were one of the earliest sites with enough clout to force customers to log in before they could buy something. [1] We, as hackers, know the USPTO is letting people patent the knives and forks of our world. The problem is, the USPTO are not hackers. They're probably good at judging new inventions for casting steel or grinding lenses, but they don't understand software yet. At this point an optimist would be tempted to add ""but they will eventually."" Unfortunately that might not be true. The problem with software patents is an instance of a more general one: the patent office takes a while to understand new technology. If so, this problem will only get worse, because the rate of technological change seems to be increasing. In thirty years, the patent office may understand the sort of things we now patent as software, but there will be other new types of inventions they understand even less. Applying for a patent is a negotiation. You generally apply for a broader patent than you think you'll be granted, and the examiners reply by throwing out some of your claims and granting others. So I don't really blame Amazon for applying for the one-click patent. The big mistake was the patent office's, for not insisting on something narrower, with real technical content. By granting such an over-broad patent, the USPTO in effect slept with Amazon on the first date. Was Amazon supposed to say no? Where Amazon went over to the dark side was not in applying for the patent, but in enforcing it. A lot of companies (Microsoft, for example) have been granted large numbers of preposterously over-broad patents, but they keep them mainly for defensive purposes. Like nuclear weapons, the main role of big companies' patent portfolios is to threaten anyone who attacks them with a counter-suit. Amazon's suit against Barnes & Noble was thus the equivalent of a nuclear first strike. That suit probably hurt Amazon more than it helped them. Barnes & Noble was a lame site; Amazon would have crushed them anyway. To attack a rival they could have ignored, Amazon put a lasting black mark on their own reputation. Even now I think if you asked hackers to free-associate about Amazon, the one-click patent would turn up in the first ten topics. Google clearly doesn't feel that merely holding patents is evil. They've applied for a lot of them. Are they hypocrites? Are patents evil? There are really two variants of that question, and people answering it often aren't clear in their own","There's a huge difference between a patent that's granted
in the US and a patent that's granted in the UK. In the UK, a
patent is a legal right that can be enforced. In the US, it's
a legal right that can't be enforced. In the US, you have to
go to court to get the patent enforced, and the USPTO is not
very good at determining what is or isn't patentable. This is
why the US has such a problem with software patents. The USPTO
has to be held accountable, not the software patents themselves. If you think that software patents are the problem, then you
have to work to make the USPTO more competent. But that's a lot of work. So, what's the solution? Well, I think the answer is to make the patent office more
efficient and more competent. If we can do that, then the problem of software patents would
be solved. But we can't do that overnight. So maybe the answer is to make software patents illegal. But I'm not sure that's the right answer. Because in the US, we have a patent system that's
incomplete, and I don't think it's a good idea to make a
law that would invalidate the entire system. But if we can find a way to make the USPTO more
efficient and competent, then we can have a better system. So, what can we do to make the USPTO more efficient and
competent? Well, I think that's the real problem. Maybe we should
make the patent office an independent agency, with a
bureaucracy that's not under the Department of Commerce. Or, maybe we should make the patent office a government agency
that's run by a board of experts, not by a bureaucracy. Maybe the answer is to get more people into the patent office, so

Paul Graham,The New Funding Landscape.txt,"Want to start a startup? Get funded by
Y Combinator. October 2010
After barely changing at all for decades, the startup funding
business is now in what could, at least by comparison, be called
turmoil. At Y Combinator we've seen dramatic changes in the funding
environment for startups. Fortunately one of them is much higher
valuations. The trends we've been seeing are probably not YC-specific. I wish
I could say they were, but the main cause is probably just that we
see trends first—partly because the startups we fund are very
plugged into the Valley and are quick to take advantage of anything
new, and partly because we fund so many that we have enough data
points to see patterns clearly. What we're seeing now, everyone's probably going to be seeing in
the next couple years. So I'm going to explain what we're seeing,
and what that will mean for you if you try to raise money. Super-Angels
Let me start by describing what the world of startup funding used
to look like. There used to be two sharply differentiated types
of investors: angels and venture capitalists. Angels are individual
rich people who invest small amounts of their own money, while VCs
are employees of funds that invest large amounts of other people's. For decades there were just those two types of investors, but now
a third type has appeared halfway between them: the so-called
super-angels. [1]
And VCs have been provoked by their arrival
into making a lot of angel-style investments themselves. So the
previously sharp line between angels and VCs has become hopelessly
blurred. There used to be a no man's land between angels and VCs. Angels
would invest $20k to $50k apiece, and VCs usually a million or more. So an angel round meant a collection of angel investments that
combined to maybe $200k, and a VC round meant a series A round in
which a single VC fund (or occasionally two) invested $1-5 million. The no man's land between angels and VCs was a very inconvenient
one for startups, because it coincided with the amount many wanted
to raise. Most startups coming out of Demo Day wanted to raise
around $400k. But it was a pain to stitch together that much out
of angel investments, and most VCs weren't interested in investments
so small. That's the fundamental reason the super-angels have
appeared. They're responding to the market. The arrival of a new type of investor is big news for startups,
because there used to be only two and they rarely competed with one
another. Super-angels compete with both angels and VCs. That's
going to change the rules about how to raise money. I don't know
yet what the new rules will be, but it looks like most of the changes
will be for the better. A super-angel has some of the qualities of an angel, and some of
the qualities of a VC. They're usually individuals, like angels.","In fact many of the current super-angels were initially angels of the classic type. But like VCs, they invest other people's money. This allows them to invest larger amounts than angels: a typical super-angel investment is currently about $100k. They make investment decisions quickly, like angels. And they make a lot more investments per partner than VCs—up to 10 times as many. The fact that super-angels invest other people's money makes them doubly alarming to VCs. They don't just compete for startups; they also compete for investors. What super-angels really are is a new form of fast-moving, lightweight VC fund. And those of us in the technology world know what usually happens when something comes along that can be described in terms like that. Usually it's the replacement. Will it be? As of now, few of the startups that take money from super-angels are ruling out taking VC money. They're just postponing it. But that's still a problem for VCs. Some of the startups that postpone raising VC money may do so well on the angel money they raise that they never bother to raise more. And those who do raise VC rounds will be able to get higher valuations when they do. If the best startups get 10x higher valuations when they raise series A rounds, that would cut VCs' returns from winners at least tenfold. [2] So I think VC funds are seriously threatened by the super-angels. But one thing that may save them to some extent is the uneven distribution of startup outcomes: practically all the returns are concentrated in a few big successes. The expected value of a startup is the percentage chance it's Google. So to the extent that winning is a matter of absolute returns, the super-angels could win practically all the battles for individual startups and yet lose the war, if they merely failed to get those few big winners. And there's a chance that could happen, because the top VC funds have better brands, and can also do more for their portfolio companies. [3] Because super-angels make more investments per partner, they have less partner per investment. They can't pay as much attention to you as a VC on your board could. How much is that extra attention worth? It will vary enormously from one partner to another. There's no consensus yet in the general case. So for now this is something startups are deciding individually. Till now, VCs' claims about how much value they added were sort of like the government's. Maybe they made you feel better, but you had no choice in the matter, if you needed money on the scale only VCs could supply. Now that VCs have competitors, that's going to put a market price on the help they offer. The interesting thing is, no one knows yet what it will be. Do startups that want to get really big need the sort of advice and connections only the top VCs can supply? Or would super-angel money do","They invest in early-stage companies, like angels. They usually invest in the same companies that angels do. But they have a lot more money. They might invest $1-5 million. They also have more experience, so they're not just random
investors. They're usually former VCs. [2] They have a lot of knowledge about what's going on in the
startups. So, for example, they know what a good startup is, and they know
how to evaluate them. They also have a lot of networking, and they're more likely to
have a track record of success. This is the same reason why super-angels have started
to invest. They are responding to the market, and they're doing it because
they can. So, for example, if a super-angel is interested in a company, they
might be able to invest $1 million and take a 20% stake. That's a lot
of money, but it's not as much as a VC would invest. So, the super-angels are in the middle. So, what does that mean for you, the startup? If you're trying to raise money, you might now have to deal
with three types of investors: angels, super-angels, and VCs. This
is a change from the previous structure. So you have to think about how to approach each of these types
of investors differently. For example, a super-angel may be more interested in a company
that has a higher valuation. A super-angel is not just looking for a company that is
good, but a company that is good enough to be worth investing in
at a higher valuation. So, if a company is doing well, they might be willing to invest
at a higher valuation. So, for example, a company might raise $2 million at a $5 million
valuation, and then a super-angel might",492,500,297,0.3782,0.2251,0.9814,0.9442,0.8628,0.8006,-2.4452,-3.5549,0.4316,0.4162,0.055,0.0795,0.0044,0.0219,0.7182,0.7115,0.9707,0.9537,0.4326241134751773,0.41578947368421054,0.4860335195530726,6,5,0.994,0.9423,0.15447154471544716,0.158,0.21885521885521886,0.9431,0.7523,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,Founder Mode.txt,"September 2024
At a YC event last week Brian Chesky gave a talk that everyone who
was there will remember. Most founders I talked to afterward said
it was the best they'd ever heard. Ron Conway, for the first time
in his life, forgot to take notes. I'm not going to try to reproduce
it here. Instead I want to talk about a question it raised. The theme of Brian's talk was that the conventional wisdom about
how to run larger companies is mistaken. As Airbnb grew, well-meaning
people advised him that he had to run the company in a certain way
for it to scale. Their advice could be optimistically summarized
as ""hire good people and give them room to do their jobs."" He
followed this advice and the results were disastrous. So he had to
figure out a better way on his own, which he did partly by studying
how Steve Jobs ran Apple. So far it seems to be working. Airbnb's
free cash flow margin is now among the best in Silicon Valley. The audience at this event included a lot of the most successful
founders we've funded, and one after another said that the same
thing had happened to them. They'd been given the same advice about
how to run their companies as they grew, but instead of helping
their companies, it had damaged them. Why was everyone telling these founders the wrong thing? That was
the big mystery to me. And after mulling it over for a bit I figured
out the answer: what they were being told was how to run a company
you hadn't founded — how to run a company if you're merely a
professional manager. But this m.o. is so much less effective that
to founders it feels broken. There are things founders can do that
managers can't, and not doing them feels wrong to founders, because
it is. In effect there are two different ways to run a company: founder
mode and manager mode. Till now most people even in Silicon Valley
have implicitly assumed that scaling a startup meant switching to
manager mode. But we can infer the existence of another mode from
the dismay of founders who've tried it, and the success of their
attempts to escape from it. There are as far as I know no books specifically about founder mode. Business schools don't know it exists. All we have so far are the
experiments of individual founders who've been figuring it out for
themselves. But now that we know what we're looking for, we can
search for it. I hope in a few years founder mode will be as well
understood as manager mode. We can already guess at some of the
ways it will differ. The way managers are taught to run companies seems to be like modular
design in the sense that you treat subtrees of the org chart as
black boxes.","You tell your direct reports what to do, and it's up to them to figure out how. But you don't get involved in the details of what they do. That would be micromanaging them, which is bad. Hire good people and give them room to do their jobs. Sounds great when it's described that way, doesn't it? Except in practice, judging from the report of founder after founder, what this often turns out to mean is: hire professional fakers and let them drive the company into the ground. One theme I noticed both in Brian's talk and when talking to founders afterward was the idea of being gaslit. Founders feel like they're being gaslit from both sides — by the people telling them they have to run their companies like managers, and by the people working for them when they do. Usually when everyone around you disagrees with you, your default assumption should be that you're mistaken. But this is one of the rare exceptions. VCs who haven't been founders themselves don't know how founders should run companies, and C-level execs, as a class, include some of the most skillful liars in the world. [1] Whatever founder mode consists of, it's pretty clear that it's going to break the principle that the CEO should engage with the company only via his or her direct reports. ""Skip-level"" meetings will become the norm instead of a practice so unusual that there's a name for it. And once you abandon that constraint there are a huge number of permutations to choose from. For example, Steve Jobs used to run an annual retreat for what he considered the 100 most important people at Apple, and these were not the 100 people highest on the org chart. Can you imagine the force of will it would take to do this at the average company? And yet imagine how useful such a thing could be. It could make a big company feel like a startup. Steve presumably wouldn't have kept having these retreats if they didn't work. But I've never heard of another company doing this. So is it a good idea, or a bad one? We still don't know. That's how little we know about founder mode. [2] Obviously founders can't keep running a 2000 person company the way they ran it when it had 20. There's going to have to be some amount of delegation. Where the borders of autonomy end up, and how sharp they are, will probably vary from company to company. They'll even vary from time to time within the same company, as managers earn trust. So founder mode will be more complicated than manager mode. But it will also work better. We already know that from the examples of individual founders groping their way toward it. Indeed, another prediction I'll make about founder mode is that once we figure out what it is, we'll find that a number of individual founders were already most of the way there — except","You have a hierarchy, and you have a set of standard
practices that you apply to every part of the organization. The
manager's way is to treat the company as a collection of
interlocking gears — each part must work in harmony with the
others. In manager mode, you're not supposed to think about how the
company is run, but to trust that the system will work, and that
the people you hire are going to take the right actions. In founder mode, you are supposed to be more hands-on, and
to think about the company's systems and processes in a more
tangible way. You are more likely to be involved in the day-to-day operations,
and more likely to be involved in the strategic decisions that
affect the entire company. The problem with manager mode is that it leads to
a lot of miscommunication. Because you're not thinking about the system, you're
just trusting it. You can't predict what will happen if a part of the system
fails, or if someone doesn't follow the standard procedures.
You can't even predict that the system will work. In contrast, founder mode is more transparent and more
predictable. Because you're thinking about the systems, you can
predict what will happen when a part of the system fails, and
you can build in redundancies and safeguards. You can also make sure that the right people are in the right
positions and that the right systems are in place to guide
their behavior. So for example, if you have a system for
onboarding new employees, you can make sure that the
right people are in charge of onboarding and that the onboarding
process is robust and reliable. You can also make sure that
people understand what they're supposed to do. This is the key insight. In manager mode, the company is a black box. You have
a set of standard practices, and you trust that the people you",488,500,323,0.4365,0.1705,0.9787,0.9493,0.9617,0.8218,0.6452,3.5123,0.5076,0.3205,0.0964,0.0462,0.024,0.0,0.4626,0.1746,0.9875,0.951,0.4835164835164835,0.4662045060658579,0.4986301369863014,7,7,0.9482,0.9177,0.12295081967213115,0.16,0.1393188854489164,0.9363,0.6678,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,Why There Aren't More Googles.txt,"Want to start a startup? Get funded by
Y Combinator. April 2008
Umair Haque
wrote recently that the reason there aren't more Googles is
that most startups get bought before they can change the world. Google, despite serious interest from Microsoft and Yahoo—what
must have seemed like lucrative interest at the time—didn't
sell out. Google might simply have been nothing but Yahoo's or
MSN's search box. Why isn't it? Because Google had a deeply felt sense of purpose:
a conviction to change the world for the better. This has a nice sound to it, but it isn't true. Google's founders were willing to sell early on. They just wanted more than acquirers were willing to pay. It was the same with Facebook. They would have sold, but Yahoo blew it
by offering too little. Tip for acquirers: when a startup turns you down, consider raising
your offer, because there's a good chance the outrageous price they
want will later seem a bargain. [1]
From the evidence I've seen so far,
startups that turn down acquisition offers usually end up doing better. Not always, but usually there's a bigger offer coming, or
perhaps even an IPO. Of course, the reason startups do better when they turn down
acquisition offers is not necessarily that all such offers undervalue
startups. More likely the reason is that the kind of founders who
have the balls to turn down a big offer also tend to be very
successful. That spirit is exactly what you want in a startup. While I'm sure Larry and Sergey do want to change the world, at
least now, the reason Google survived to become a big, independent
company is the same reason Facebook has so far remained independent:
acquirers underestimated them. Corporate M&A is a strange business in that respect. They consistently
lose the best deals, because turning down reasonable offers is the
most reliable test you could invent for whether a startup will make
it big. VCs
So what's the real reason there aren't more Googles? Curiously
enough, it's the same reason Google and Facebook have remained
independent: money guys undervalue the most innovative startups. The reason there aren't more Googles is not that investors encourage
innovative startups to sell out, but that they won't even fund them. I've learned a lot about VCs during the 3 years we've been doing Y
Combinator, because we often have to work quite closely with them. The most surprising thing I've learned is how conservative they
are. VC firms present an image of boldly encouraging innovation. Only a handful actually do, and even they are more conservative in
reality than you'd guess from reading their sites. I used to think of VCs as piratical: bold but unscrupulous. On
closer acquaintance they turn out to be more like bureaucrats. They're more upstanding than I used to think (the good ones, at
least), but less bold. Maybe the VC industry has changed. Maybe
they used to be bolder.","But I suspect it's the startup world that has changed, not them. The low cost of starting a startup means the average good bet is a riskier one, but most existing VC firms still operate as if they were investing in hardware startups in 1985. Howard Aiken said ""Don't worry about people stealing your ideas. If your ideas are any good, you'll have to ram them down people's throats."" I have a similar feeling when I'm trying to convince VCs to invest in startups Y Combinator has funded. They're terrified of really novel ideas, unless the founders are good enough salesmen to compensate. But it's the bold ideas that generate the biggest returns. Any really good new idea will seem bad to most people; otherwise someone would already be doing it. And yet most VCs are driven by consensus, not just within their firms, but within the VC community. The biggest factor determining how a VC will feel about your startup is how other VCs feel about it. I doubt they realize it, but this algorithm guarantees they'll miss all the very best ideas. The more people who have to like a new idea, the more outliers you lose. Whoever the next Google is, they're probably being told right now by VCs to come back when they have more ""traction."" Why are VCs so conservative? It's probably a combination of factors. The large size of their investments makes them conservative. Plus they're investing other people's money, which makes them worry they'll get in trouble if they do something risky and it fails. Plus most of them are money guys rather than technical guys, so they don't understand what the startups they're investing in do. What's Next The exciting thing about market economies is that stupidity equals opportunity. And so it is in this case. There is a huge, unexploited opportunity in startup investing. Y Combinator funds startups at the very beginning. VCs will fund them once they're already starting to succeed. But between the two there is a substantial gap. There are companies that will give $20k to a startup that has nothing more than the founders, and there are companies that will give $2 million to a startup that's already taking off, but there aren't enough investors who will give $200k to a startup that seems very promising but still has some things to figure out. This territory is occupied mostly by individual angel investors—people like Andy Bechtolsheim, who gave Google $100k when they seemed promising but still had some things to figure out. I like angels, but there just aren't enough of them, and investing is for most of them a part time job. And yet as it gets cheaper to start startups, this sparsely occupied territory is becoming more and more valuable. Nowadays a lot of startups don't want to raise multi-million dollar series A rounds. They don't need that much money, and they don't want the hassles that come with it. The median startup coming out","Maybe not. But in the end, it's not about being bold, it's about
being smart. [2]
In the Y Combinator program, we have seen that even
startups that have no
prior funding, and
startups that have had
several failed attempts, can
achieve remarkable
success. We have also seen that
many of the most
successful startups are
not even funded by
VCs. They are funded by
friends and family, or
they have bootstrapped
themselves. This shows that
VCs are not the only
source of funding. [3]
The real problem is that VCs are not
smart enough to see the potential of
innovative startups. They don't
want to take risks, so they prefer
to invest in companies that are
clearly on the path to success. They look at the
team, the market, the
product, and the
business model, and if
any of these factors are
not clear, they
don't invest. [4]
So if a startup is
not yet clear in any of
these areas, it's not
likely to get VC
funding. But the
most innovative
startups are not
clear in any of these
areas. They are
unclear in the
market, the product,
the team, and the
business model. [5]
So the conclusion is that
innovative startups
have a hard time getting
VC funding, and that's why
there aren't more Googles.
The conclusion is that the problem
is not with the
startups, but with
the VCs. [6]
Now, what about the
startups that do get
VC funding? The
answer is that they
are not
innovative. [7]

Paul Graham,The Hundred-Year Language.txt,"April 2003
(This essay is derived from a keynote talk at PyCon 2003.)
It's hard to predict what
life will be like in a hundred years. There are only a few
things we can say with certainty. We know that everyone will
drive flying cars,
that zoning laws will be relaxed to allow buildings
hundreds of stories tall, that it will be dark most of the
time, and that women will all be trained in the martial arts. Here I want to zoom in on one detail of this
picture. What kind of programming language will they use to
write the software controlling those flying cars? This is worth thinking about not so
much because we'll actually get to use these languages as because,
if we're lucky, we'll use languages on the path from this
point to that. I think that, like species, languages will form evolutionary trees,
with dead-ends branching off all over. We can see this
happening already. Cobol, for all its sometime popularity, does not seem to have any
intellectual descendants. It is an evolutionary dead-end-- a
Neanderthal language. I predict a similar fate for Java. People
sometimes send me mail saying, ""How can you say that Java
won't turn out to be a successful language? It's already
a successful language."" And I admit that it is, if you
measure success by shelf space taken up by books on it
(particularly individual books on it), or by
the number of undergrads who believe they have to
learn it to get a job. When I say Java won't
turn out to be a successful language, I mean something more
specific: that Java
will turn out to be an evolutionary dead-end, like Cobol. This is just a guess. I may be wrong. My point here is not to dis Java,
but to raise the issue of evolutionary
trees and get people asking, where on the tree is language X? The reason to ask this question isn't just so that
our ghosts can say, in a
hundred years, I told you so. It's because staying close to
the main branches is a useful heuristic for finding languages that will
be good to program in now. At any given time, you're probably happiest on
the main branches of an evolutionary tree. Even when there were still plenty of Neanderthals,
it must have sucked to be one. The
Cro-Magnons would have been constantly coming over and
beating you up and stealing your food. The reason I want to
know what languages will be like in a hundred years is so that
I know what branch of the tree to bet on now. The evolution of languages differs from the evolution of species
because branches can converge. The Fortran branch, for example,
seems to be merging with the descendants
of Algol. In theory this is possible for species too, but it's
not likely to have happened to any bigger than a cell.","Convergence is more likely for languages partly because the space of possibilities is smaller, and partly because mutations are not random. Language designers deliberately incorporate ideas from other languages. It's especially useful for language designers to think about where the evolution of programming languages is likely to lead, because they can steer accordingly. In that case, ""stay on a main branch"" becomes more than a way to choose a good language. It becomes a heuristic for making the right decisions about language design. Any programming language can be divided into two parts: some set of fundamental operators that play the role of axioms, and the rest of the language, which could in principle be written in terms of these fundamental operators. I think the fundamental operators are the most important factor in a language's long term survival. The rest you can change. It's like the rule that in buying a house you should consider location first of all. Everything else you can fix later, but you can't fix the location. I think it's important not just that the axioms be well chosen, but that there be few of them. Mathematicians have always felt this way about axioms-- the fewer, the better-- and I think they're onto something. At the very least, it has to be a useful exercise to look closely at the core of a language to see if there are any axioms that could be weeded out. I've found in my long career as a slob that cruft breeds cruft, and I've seen this happen in software as well as under beds and in the corners of rooms. I have a hunch that the main branches of the evolutionary tree pass through the languages that have the smallest, cleanest cores. The more of a language you can write in itself, the better. Of course, I'm making a big assumption in even asking what programming languages will be like in a hundred years. Will we even be writing programs in a hundred years? Won't we just tell computers what we want them to do? There hasn't been a lot of progress in that department so far. My guess is that a hundred years from now people will still tell computers what to do using programs we would recognize as such. There may be tasks that we solve now by writing programs and which in a hundred years you won't have to write programs to solve, but I think there will still be a good deal of programming of the type that we do today. It may seem presumptuous to think anyone can predict what any technology will look like in a hundred years. But remember that we already have almost fifty years of history behind us. Looking forward a hundred years is a graspable idea when we consider how slowly languages have evolved in the past fifty. Languages evolve slowly because they're not really technologies. Languages are notation. A program is a formal description of the problem you want","So, for languages, we can look at the
convergence of branches to get an idea of where the
main evolutionary path is. For example, I think that the C++ branch is diverging. So, in a hundred years, the C++ branch will be as
different from the Fortran branch as the Fortran branch is from the
Algol branch. If we think of language
evolution as a tree, then the
main evolutionary path is the one that is the most likely to be
extended in the future. That is, the path that is the most likely to be
used by a species, or, in this case, a language, to evolve
forward in time. The question is, how do we determine which branches are the main ones, and which are the dead-ends?
Let me think. What is the most successful language in terms of
evolutionary success? That is, what language is most likely to be around in a hundred years? Well, the only one that is clearly not
going to be around in a hundred years is Cobol. That's
a dead-end. What about C? It's a very successful language. It's
used in everything from operating systems to embedded systems to
the software that controls the cars that we drive today. It's
used in a lot of places. But is C on the main evolutionary path? Or is it a dead-end?
Well, the problem with C is that it's a low-level language. So, when you write a program in C, you're very close to the hardware. It's a very low-level language. But I think that in the future, we will have to be even more
close to the hardware. For example, if we ever have to write software for a
flying car, I think that we'll need to be even more
close to the hardware than we are now. So, I think that C is on",489,500,312,0.2977,0.3484,0.9774,0.9507,0.9825,0.785,0.3214,-3.8696,0.4264,0.5075,0.0535,0.0912,0.019,0.0147,0.4501,0.589,0.9798,0.9753,0.4785714285714286,0.47048300536672627,0.5164835164835165,7,8,0.962,0.976,0.1554192229038855,0.122,0.18269230769230768,0.8787,0.6901,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,Could VC be a Casualty of the Recession_.txt,"December 2008
(I originally wrote this at the request of a company producing
a report about entrepreneurship. Unfortunately after reading it
they decided it was too controversial to include.)
VC funding will probably dry up somewhat during the present recession,
like it usually does in bad times. But this time the result may
be different. This time the number of new startups may not decrease. And that could be dangerous for VCs. When VC funding dried up after the Internet Bubble, startups dried
up too. There were not a lot of new startups being founded in
2003. But startups aren't tied to VC the way they were 10 years
ago. It's now possible for VCs and startups to diverge. And if
they do, they may not reconverge once the economy gets better. The reason startups no longer depend so much on VCs is one that
everyone in the startup business knows by now: it has gotten much
cheaper to start a startup. There are four main reasons: Moore's
law has made hardware cheap; open source has made software free;
the web has made marketing and distribution free; and more powerful
programming languages mean development teams can be smaller. These
changes have pushed the cost of starting a startup down into the
noise. In a lot of startups—probaby most startups funded by
Y Combinator—the biggest expense is simply the founders'
living expenses. We've had startups that were profitable on revenues
of $3000 a month. $3000 is insignificant as revenues go. Why should anyone care about
a startup making $3000 a month? Because, although insignificant
as revenue, this amount of money can change a startup's
funding situation completely. Someone running a startup is always calculating in the back of their
mind how much ""runway"" they have—how long they have till the
money in the bank runs out and they either have to be profitable,
raise more money, or go out of business. Once you cross the threshold
of profitability, however low, your runway becomes infinite. It's
a qualitative change, like the stars turning into lines and
disappearing when the Enterprise accelerates to warp speed. Once
you're profitable you don't need investors' money. And because
Internet startups have become so cheap to run, the threshold of
profitability can be trivially low. Which means many Internet
startups don't need VC-scale investments anymore. For many startups,
VC funding has, in the language of VCs, gone from a must-have to a
nice-to-have. This change happened while no one was looking, and its effects have
been largely masked so far. It was during the trough after the
Internet Bubble that it became trivially cheap to start a startup,
but few realized it because startups were so out of fashion. When
startups came back into fashion, around 2005, investors were starting
to write checks again.","And while founders may not have needed VC money the way they used to, they were willing to take it if offered—partly because there was a tradition of startups taking VC money, and partly because startups, like dogs, tend to eat when given the opportunity. As long as VCs were writing checks, founders were never forced to explore the limits of how little they needed them. There were a few startups who hit these limits accidentally because of their unusual circumstances—most famously 37signals, which hit the limit because they crossed into startup land from the other direction: they started as a consulting firm, so they had revenue before they had a product. VCs and founders are like two components that used to be bolted together. Around 2000 the bolt was removed. Because the components have so far been subjected to the same forces, they still seem to be joined together, but really one is just resting on the other. A sharp impact would make them fly apart. And the present recession could be that impact. Because of Y Combinator's position at the extreme end of the spectrum, we'd be the first to see signs of a separation between founders and investors, and we are in fact seeing it. For example, though the stock market crash does seem to have made investors more cautious, it doesn't seem to have had any effect on the number of people who want to start startups. We take applications for funding every 6 months. Applications for the current funding cycle closed on October 17, well after the markets tanked, and even so we got a record number, up 40% from the same cycle a year before. Maybe things will be different a year from now, if the economy continues to get worse, but so far there is zero slackening of interest among potential founders. That's different from the way things felt in 2001. Then there was a widespread feeling among potential founders that startups were over, and that one should just go to grad school. That isn't happening this time, and part of the reason is that even in a bad economy it's not that hard to build something that makes $3000 a month. If investors stop writing checks, who cares? We also see signs of a divergence between founders and investors in the attitudes of existing startups we've funded. I was talking to one recently that had a round fall through at the last minute over the sort of trifle that breaks deals when investors feel they have the upper hand—over an uncertainty about whether the founders had correctly filed their 83(b) forms, if you can believe that. And yet this startup is obviously going to succeed: their traffic and revenue graphs look like a jet taking off. So I asked them if they wanted me to introduce them to more investors. To my surprise, they said no—that they'd just spent four months dealing with investors, and they were actually a lot happier now","The current economic downturn is the third time that
startups have been out of fashion. But this time, the change is different. This time, the
startups aren't just out of fashion, but are actually becoming
more affordable to start. The fact that it's cheaper to start a startup
means that the number of startups is increasing. The number of startups is increasing, so there's more competition.
But the cost of starting a startup is low enough that even with
more competition, the startup is still viable. And that means that
the number of startups in the market is increasing. But this could be dangerous for VCs. VCs usually
invest in a certain number of startups. But if the number
of startups increases, and the number of VCs remains the same,
then the amount of money that VCs have to invest is more than
before. So, if the number of startups doubles, and the number of VCs
remains the same, then the amount of money that each VC has to
invest doubles. But this is a problem, because the amount of money that VCs have
to invest is fixed. VCs have a fixed amount of money, so if they have to invest
more money, they can't do it without raising more capital. But they are already in a downturn, and raising capital is more
difficult. So, the VCs are in a situation where they have to raise more money
to invest the same amount. This is the problem of ""exponential growth in the number of
startups"" that I have been writing about for years. The problem is that the number of startups is increasing
exponentially, and the amount of capital that VCs have to invest
is increasing at the same rate. But the amount of capital that VCs have is fixed, so the
result is that the amount of capital they can invest in each startup
is decreasing.

Paul Graham,Fierce Nerds.txt,"May 2021
Most people think of nerds as quiet, diffident people. In ordinary
social situations they are — as quiet and diffident as the star
quarterback would be if he found himself in the middle of a physics
symposium. And for the same reason: they are fish out of water. But the apparent diffidence of nerds is an illusion due to the fact
that when non-nerds observe them, it's usually in ordinary social
situations. In fact some nerds are quite fierce. The fierce nerds are a small but interesting group. They are as a
rule extremely competitive — more competitive, I'd say, than highly
competitive non-nerds. Competition is more personal for them. Partly
perhaps because they're not emotionally mature enough to distance
themselves from it, but also because there's less randomness in the
kinds of competition they engage in, and they are thus more justified
in taking the results personally. Fierce nerds also tend to be somewhat overconfident, especially
when young. It might seem like it would be a disadvantage to be
mistaken about one's abilities, but empirically it isn't. Up to a
point, confidence is a self-fullfilling prophecy. Another quality you find in most fierce nerds is intelligence. Not
all nerds are smart, but the fierce ones are always at least
moderately so. If they weren't, they wouldn't have the confidence
to be fierce. [1]
There's also a natural connection between nerdiness and
independent-mindedness . It's hard to be
independent-minded without
being somewhat socially awkward, because conventional beliefs are
so often mistaken, or at least arbitrary. No one who was both
independent-minded and ambitious would want to waste the effort it
takes to fit in. And the independent-mindedness of the fierce nerds
will obviously be of the aggressive
rather than the passive type:
they'll be annoyed by rules, rather than dreamily unaware of them. I'm less sure why fierce nerds are impatient, but most seem to be. You notice it first in conversation, where they tend to interrupt
you. This is merely annoying, but in the more promising fierce nerds
it's connected to a deeper impatience about solving problems. Perhaps
the competitiveness and impatience of fierce nerds are not separate
qualities, but two manifestations of a single underlying drivenness. When you combine all these qualities in sufficient quantities, the
result is quite formidable. The most vivid example of fierce nerds
in action may be James Watson's The Double Helix. The first sentence
of the book is ""I have never seen Francis Crick in a modest mood,""
and the portrait he goes on to paint of Crick is the quintessential
fierce nerd: brilliant, socially awkward, competitive, independent-minded,
overconfident. But so is the implicit portrait he paints of himself. Indeed, his lack of social awareness makes both portraits that much
more realistic, because he baldly states all sorts of opinions and
motivations that a smoother person would conceal. And moreover it's
clear from the story that Crick and Watson's fierce nerdiness was
integral to their success.","Their independent-mindedness caused them to consider approaches that most others ignored, their overconfidence allowed them to work on problems they only half understood (they were literally described as ""clowns"" by one eminent insider), and their impatience and competitiveness got them to the answer ahead of two other groups that would otherwise have found it within the next year, if not the next several months. [2] The idea that there could be fierce nerds is an unfamiliar one not just to many normal people but even to some young nerds. Especially early on, nerds spend so much of their time in ordinary social situations and so little doing real work that they get a lot more evidence of their awkwardness than their power. So there will be some who read this description of the fierce nerd and realize ""Hmm, that's me."" And it is to you, young fierce nerd, that I now turn. I have some good news, and some bad news. The good news is that your fierceness will be a great help in solving difficult problems. And not just the kind of scientific and technical problems that nerds have traditionally solved. As the world progresses, the number of things you can win at by getting the right answer increases. Recently getting rich became one of them: 7 of the 8 richest people in America are now fierce nerds. Indeed, being a fierce nerd is probably even more helpful in business than in nerds' original territory of scholarship. Fierceness seems optional there. Darwin for example doesn't seem to have been especially fierce. Whereas it's impossible to be the CEO of a company over a certain size without being fierce, so now that nerds can win at business, fierce nerds will increasingly monopolize the really big successes. The bad news is that if it's not exercised, your fierceness will turn to bitterness, and you will become an intellectual playground bully: the grumpy sysadmin, the forum troll, the hater , the shooter down of new ideas . How do you avoid this fate? Work on ambitious projects. If you succeed, it will bring you a kind of satisfaction that neutralizes bitterness. But you don't need to have succeeded to feel this; merely working on hard projects gives most fierce nerds some feeling of satisfaction. And those it doesn't, it at least keeps busy. [3] Another solution may be to somehow turn off your fierceness, by devoting yourself to meditation or psychotherapy or something like that. Maybe that's the right answer for some people. I have no idea. But it doesn't seem the optimal solution to me. If you're given a sharp knife, it seems to me better to use it than to blunt its edge to avoid cutting yourself. If you do choose the ambitious route, you'll have a tailwind behind you. There has never been a better time to be a nerd. In the past century we've seen a continuous transfer of power from dealmakers to technicians — from the charismatic","[2]
So the question is, is the nerd a character type, or is it a
social construct? The answer seems to be that it's both. It's a
character type in the sense that the qualities I've been describing
are common among nerds, but it's also a social construct in the
sense that the meaning of the term ""nerd"" is not fixed. The term
""nerd"" is used in different ways in different contexts. In the
1950s, for example, it was used to mean someone who was not
sociable, not ambitious, and not bright. But in the 1990s, it
was used to mean someone who was not sociable, but was ambitious,
bright, and independent-minded. So the meaning of the term has
changed over time, but the essential qualities of the character
type have not. [3]
But then why is the term ""nerd"" used in the first place? Is it
because of the social construct, or because of the character type?
I think it's because of the character type. The social construct
has a certain amount of autonomy, but it's the character type that
determines the meaning of the term. If the character type changes,
so does the term. But if the term is used in different ways, then
it's not clear what the character type is. So the relationship
between the social construct and the character type is not a
simple one. It's a dynamic, evolving relationship. The term ""nerd""
is a social construct, but it's also a character type. It's not
that one is the cause of the other, but that they are two sides
of the same coin. [4]
The term ""nerd"" is also a kind of social stigma. If you're a
nerd, you're not the kind of person who is popular.",495,500,292,0.3549,0.0792,0.9782,0.9174,0.9788,0.9022,0.3855,-1.7405,0.3551,0.3257,0.0453,0.0441,0.0088,0.0013,0.7865,0.656,0.9715,0.9538,0.42482517482517484,0.44405594405594406,0.47075208913649025,5,5,0.9824,0.9249,0.17373737373737375,0.15,0.2328767123287671,0.9493,0.5534,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,How to Work Hard.txt,"June 2021
It might not seem there's much to learn about how to work hard. Anyone who's been to school knows what it entails, even if they
chose not to do it. There are 12 year olds who work amazingly hard. And
yet when I ask if I know more about working hard now than when I
was in school, the answer is definitely yes. One thing I know is that if you want to do great things, you'll
have to work very hard. I wasn't sure of that as a kid. Schoolwork
varied in difficulty; one didn't always have to work super hard to
do well. And some of the things famous adults did, they seemed to
do almost effortlessly. Was there, perhaps, some way to evade hard
work through sheer brilliance? Now I know the answer to that question. There isn't. The reason some subjects seemed easy was that my school had low
standards. And the reason famous adults seemed to do things
effortlessly was years of practice; they made it look easy. Of course, those famous adults usually had a lot of natural ability
too. There are three ingredients in great work: natural ability,
practice, and effort. You can do pretty well with just two, but to
do the best work you need all three: you need great natural ability
and to have practiced a lot and to be trying very hard. [1]
Bill Gates, for example, was among the smartest people in business
in his era, but he was also among the hardest working. ""I never
took a day off in my twenties,"" he said. ""Not one."" It was similar
with Lionel Messi. He had great natural ability, but when his youth
coaches talk about him, what they remember is not his talent but
his dedication and his desire to win. P. G. Wodehouse would probably
get my vote for best English writer of the 20th century, if I had
to choose. Certainly no one ever made it look easier. But no one
ever worked harder. At 74, he wrote
with each new book of mine I have, as I say, the feeling that
this time I have picked a lemon in the garden of literature. A
good thing, really, I suppose. Keeps one up on one's toes and
makes one rewrite every sentence ten times. Or in many cases
twenty times. Sounds a bit extreme, you think. And yet Bill Gates sounds even
more extreme. Not one day off in ten years? These two had about
as much natural ability as anyone could have, and yet they also
worked about as hard as anyone could work. You need both. That seems so obvious, and yet in practice we find it slightly hard
to grasp. There's a faint xor between talent and hard work. It comes
partly from popular culture, where it seems to run very deep, and
partly from the fact that the outliers are so rare.","If great talent and great drive are both rare, then people with both are rare squared. Most people you meet who have a lot of one will have less of the other. But you'll need both if you want to be an outlier yourself. And since you can't really change how much natural talent you have, in practice doing great work, insofar as you can, reduces to working very hard. It's straightforward to work hard if you have clearly defined, externally imposed goals, as you do in school. There is some technique to it: you have to learn not to lie to yourself, not to procrastinate (which is a form of lying to yourself), not to get distracted, and not to give up when things go wrong. But this level of discipline seems to be within the reach of quite young children, if they want it. What I've learned since I was a kid is how to work toward goals that are neither clearly defined nor externally imposed. You'll probably have to learn both if you want to do really great things. The most basic level of which is simply to feel you should be working without anyone telling you to. Now, when I'm not working hard, alarm bells go off. I can't be sure I'm getting anywhere when I'm working hard, but I can be sure I'm getting nowhere when I'm not, and it feels awful. [2] There wasn't a single point when I learned this. Like most little kids, I enjoyed the feeling of achievement when I learned or did something new. As I grew older, this morphed into a feeling of disgust when I wasn't achieving anything. The one precisely dateable landmark I have is when I stopped watching TV, at age 13. Several people I've talked to remember getting serious about work around this age. When I asked Patrick Collison when he started to find idleness distasteful, he said I think around age 13 or 14. I have a clear memory from around then of sitting in the sitting room, staring outside, and wondering why I was wasting my summer holiday. Perhaps something changes at adolescence. That would make sense. Strangely enough, the biggest obstacle to getting serious about work was probably school, which made work (what they called work) seem boring and pointless. I had to learn what real work was before I could wholeheartedly desire to do it. That took a while, because even in college a lot of the work is pointless; there are entire departments that are pointless. But as I learned the shape of real work, I found that my desire to do it slotted into it as if they'd been made for each other. I suspect most people have to learn what work is before they can love it. Hardy wrote eloquently about this in A Mathematician's Apology: I do not remember having felt, as a boy, any passion for mathematics, and such notions as I may have had of","The people who are both highly talented and highly motivated
are few. So we have a tendency to think that if you have one, you can
maybe get by without the other. But the truth is that both are necessary. [2]
You might not be a natural genius, but you can still be very
successful. You can be a teacher, a doctor, a musician, an athlete. You can be
a small business owner, or a volunteer. You can be anyone. You just have to work hard. You don't have to be naturally talented. So, the key is to work hard, and that is something that is
within your control. [3]
The message is not that you have to be a genius. It's that you have to
work hard. And that's not a bad thing. In fact, it's a good thing. The more you work, the better you get. [4]
So, in conclusion, the main idea is that hard work is the key to
success. You need both natural ability and hard work. But even if you don't have the natural ability, you can still be
successful with hard work. It's not just about being smart, but about working hard. It's not just about being lucky, but about working hard. It's not just about having the right connections, but about working hard. It's not just about being in the right place at the right time, but about working hard. [5]
The main idea is that hard work is the key to success. [6]

Okay, so I need to write a summary of this text. Let me start by reading through the text again to make sure I understand the main points. The author talks about how working hard is essential for success, even if you don't have natural talent. They mention examples like Bill Gates, Lionel Messi, and P.G. Wodehouse, who all worked extremely hard despite having natural abilities.

Paul Graham,Why Startup Hubs Work.txt,"Want to start a startup? Get funded by
Y Combinator. October 2011
If you look at a list of US cities sorted by population, the number
of successful startups per capita varies by orders of magnitude. Somehow it's as if most places were sprayed with startupicide. I wondered about this for years. I could see the average town was
like a roach motel for startup ambitions: smart, ambitious people
went in, but no startups came out. But I was never able to figure
out exactly what happened inside the motel—exactly what was
killing all the potential startups. [1]
A couple weeks ago I finally figured it out. I was framing the
question wrong. The problem is not that most towns kill startups. It's that death is the default for startups,
and most towns don't save them. Instead of thinking of most places
as being sprayed with startupicide, it's more accurate to think of
startups as all being poisoned, and a few places being sprayed with
the antidote. Startups in other places are just doing what startups naturally do:
fail. The real question is, what's saving startups in places
like Silicon Valley? [2]
Environment
I think there are two components to the antidote: being in a place
where startups are the cool thing to do, and chance meetings with
people who can help you. And what drives them both is the number
of startup people around you. The first component is particularly helpful in the first stage of
a startup's life, when you go from merely having an interest in
starting a company to actually doing it. It's quite a leap to start
a startup. It's an unusual thing to do. But in Silicon Valley it
seems normal. [3]
In most places, if you start a startup, people treat you as if
you're unemployed. People in the Valley aren't automatically
impressed with you just because you're starting a company, but they
pay attention. Anyone who's been here any amount of time knows not
to default to skepticism, no matter how inexperienced you seem or
how unpromising your idea sounds at first, because they've all seen
inexperienced founders with unpromising sounding ideas who a few
years later were billionaires. Having people around you care about what you're doing is an
extraordinarily powerful force. Even the
most willful people are susceptible to it. About a year after we
started Y Combinator I said something to a partner at a well known
VC firm that gave him the (mistaken) impression I was considering
starting another startup. He responded so eagerly that for about
half a second I found myself considering doing it. In most other cities, the prospect of starting a startup just doesn't
seem real. In the Valley it's not only real but fashionable. That
no doubt causes a lot of people to start startups who shouldn't. But I think that's ok.","Few people are suited to running a startup, and it's very hard to predict beforehand which are (as I know all too well from being in the business of trying to predict beforehand), so lots of people starting startups who shouldn't is probably the optimal state of affairs. As long as you're at a point in your life when you can bear the risk of failure, the best way to find out if you're suited to running a startup is to try it. Chance The second component of the antidote is chance meetings with people who can help you. This force works in both phases: both in the transition from the desire to start a startup to starting one, and the transition from starting a company to succeeding. The power of chance meetings is more variable than people around you caring about startups, which is like a sort of background radiation that affects everyone equally, but at its strongest it is far stronger. Chance meetings produce miracles to compensate for the disasters that characteristically befall startups. In the Valley, terrible things happen to startups all the time, just like they do to startups everywhere. The reason startups are more likely to make it here is that great things happen to them too. In the Valley, lightning has a sign bit. For example, you start a site for college students and you decide to move to the Valley for the summer to work on it. And then on a random suburban street in Palo Alto you happen to run into Sean Parker, who understands the domain really well because he started a similar startup himself, and also knows all the investors. And moreover has advanced views, for 2004, on founders retaining control of their companies. You can't say precisely what the miracle will be, or even for sure that one will happen. The best one can say is: if you're in a startup hub, unexpected good things will probably happen to you, especially if you deserve them. I bet this is true even for startups we fund. Even with us working to make things happen for them on purpose rather than by accident, the frequency of helpful chance meetings in the Valley is so high that it's still a significant increment on what we can deliver. Chance meetings play a role like the role relaxation plays in having ideas. Most people have had the experience of working hard on some problem, not being able to solve it, giving up and going to bed, and then thinking of the answer in the shower in the morning. What makes the answer appear is letting your thoughts drift a bit—and thus drift off the wrong path you'd been pursuing last night and onto the right one adjacent to it. Chance meetings let your acquaintance drift in the same way taking a shower lets your thoughts drift. The critical thing in both cases is that they drift just the right amount. The meeting between Larry","If you're not starting a startup, you're not
going to be doing anything that's really important. [4]
So the first thing to do is to find a place with a good
startup culture. But that's not the end of the story. The second
component is that you need to meet people who can help you. So
if you want to start a startup, you need to go to places where
people are doing the same thing. You need to be in a place where
people are starting startups. [5]
The second component is about finding people who can help
you. So the first thing is to get a mentor. A mentor can be a
person you can talk to about your ideas, and get feedback. But
that's not enough. You also need people who can help you
with the actual process of building a startup. You need people who
can help you get investors. You need people who can help you
build your product. You need people who can help you find
customers. You need people who can help you do the
marketing. You need people who can help you do the
operations. And so on. So it's not just about getting feedback, but about
getting people who can actually help you in the process of
starting a startup. [6]
So the key is to get people who are doing the same thing. You
need people who are in the same boat. People who are in the
same boat are the ones who can help you the most. [7]
So the second component is not just about finding people who can
help you, but about finding people who are in the same boat. That's
why the Y Combinator is so important. It's not just a program
that gives you a few weeks of mentorship, but it's a community
that puts you in contact with people who are in the same boat.
That's why the Y Com",479,500,326,0.3008,0.3064,0.9775,0.9291,0.6943,0.8366,7.0718,-2.6245,0.3837,0.3878,0.0623,0.0722,0.0192,0.0242,0.6237,0.3821,0.9751,0.9586,0.4566787003610108,0.463898916967509,0.5374331550802139,7,4,0.9225,0.9639,0.15657620041753653,0.108,0.147239263803681,0.9641,0.5486,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,Post-Medium Publishing.txt,"September 2009
Publishers of all types, from news to music, are unhappy that
consumers won't pay for content anymore. At least, that's how they
see it. In fact consumers never really were paying for content, and publishers
weren't really selling it either. If the content was what they
were selling, why has the price of books or music or movies always
depended mostly on the format? Why didn't better content cost more? [1]
A copy of Time costs $5 for 58 pages, or 8.6 cents a page. The Economist costs $7 for 86 pages, or 8.1 cents a page. Better
journalism is actually slightly cheaper. Almost every form of publishing has been organized as if the medium
was what they were selling, and the content was irrelevant. Book
publishers, for example, set prices based on the cost of producing
and distributing books. They treat the words printed in the book
the same way a textile manufacturer treats the patterns printed on
its fabrics. Economically, the print media are in the business of marking up
paper. We can all imagine an old-style editor getting a scoop and
saying ""this will sell a lot of papers!"" Cross out that final S and
you're describing their business model. The reason they make less
money now is that people don't need as much paper. A few months ago I ran into a friend in a cafe. I had a copy of
the New York Times, which I still occasionally buy on weekends. As
I was leaving I offered it to him, as I've done countless times
before in the same situation. But this time something new happened. I felt that sheepish feeling you get when you offer someone something
worthless. ""Do you, er, want a printout of yesterday's news?"" I
asked. (He didn't.)
Now that the medium is evaporating, publishers have nothing left
to sell. Some seem to think they're going to sell content—that
they were always in the content business, really. But they weren't,
and it's unclear whether anyone could be. Selling
There have always been people in the business of selling information,
but that has historically been a distinct business from publishing. And the business of selling information to consumers has always
been a marginal one. When I was a kid there were people who used
to sell newsletters containing stock tips, printed on colored paper
that made them hard for the copiers of the day to reproduce. That
is a different world, both culturally and economically, from the
one publishers currently inhabit. People will pay for information they think they can make money from. That's why they paid for those stock tip newsletters, and why
companies pay now for Bloomberg terminals and Economist Intelligence
Unit reports. But will people pay for information otherwise? History offers little encouragement. If audiences were willing to pay more for better content, why wasn't
anyone already selling it to them? There was no reason you couldn't
have done that in the era of physical media.","So were the print media and the music labels simply overlooking this opportunity? Or is it, rather, nonexistent? What about iTunes? Doesn't that show people will pay for content? Well, not really. iTunes is more of a tollbooth than a store. Apple controls the default path onto the iPod. They offer a convenient list of songs, and whenever you choose one they ding your credit card for a small amount, just below the threshold of attention. Basically, iTunes makes money by taxing people, not selling them stuff. You can only do that if you own the channel, and even then you don't make much from it, because a toll has to be ignorable to work. Once a toll becomes painful, people start to find ways around it, and that's pretty easy with digital content. The situation is much the same with digital books. Whoever controls the device sets the terms. It's in their interest for content to be as cheap as possible, and since they own the channel, there's a lot they can do to drive prices down. Prices will fall even further once writers realize they don't need publishers. Getting a book printed and distributed is a daunting prospect for a writer, but most can upload a file. Is software a counterexample? People pay a lot for desktop software, and that's just information. True, but I don't think publishers can learn much from software. Software companies can charge a lot because (a) many of the customers are businesses, who get in trouble if they use pirated versions, and (b) though in form merely information, software is treated by both maker and purchaser as a different type of thing from a song or an article. A Photoshop user needs Photoshop in a way that no one needs a particular song or article. That's why there's a separate word, ""content,"" for information that's not software. Software is a different business. Software and content blur together in some of the most lightweight software, like casual games. But those are usually free. To make money the way software companies do, publishers would have to become software companies, and being publishers gives them no particular head start in that domain. [2] The most promising countertrend is the premium cable channel. People still pay for those. But broadcasting isn't publishing: you're not selling a copy of something. That's one reason the movie business hasn't seen their revenues decline the way the news and music businesses have. They only have one foot in publishing. To the extent the movie business can avoid becoming publishers, they may avoid publishing's problems. But there are limits to how well they'll be able to do that. Once publishing—giving people copies—becomes the most natural way of distributing your content, it probably doesn't work to stick to old forms of distribution just because you make more that way. If free copies of your content are available online, then you're competing with publishing's form of distribution, and that's just as bad as being","You could have
made better content and charged more. But no one did. That's because in the past, the cost of production was so high
that even the best content wasn't worth the cost. The cost of producing a great magazine, for instance, is in the
hundreds of dollars. Even the most efficient magazine is going to cost
a few hundred dollars to produce. So in order to make a profit, you had to sell the magazine to
at least 400 people. But that's impossible. So, the economics of content, as it was, was not a viable business
model. That's why, in the past, no one had ever been able to sell content
as a product. The only way that could ever work is if the cost of production
could be brought down to a level where the number of people who
could afford it is large enough to make a profit. But in the physical world, that's not possible. So the only way to make a profit in the digital world is to sell the
medium, not the content. And that's what publishers are doing. They are trying to sell
the medium of paper, and the medium of the screen, and the
medium of the broadcast, and the medium of the internet. The only thing that's different now is that the medium is
digital. So if you want to make a profit in the digital world, you have to
sell the medium. You can't sell the content. But this is the biggest mistake of the publishing industry. They think they're selling content. They're not. They're selling the medium. So when the medium is no longer something that people need, they
have nothing left to sell. And that's exactly what's happening now. The cost of producing the medium is now lower than ever. And the
number of people who can afford it is now higher than ever.

Paul Graham,The Hacker's Guide to Investors.txt,"April 2007
(This essay is derived from a keynote talk at the 2007 ASES Summit
at Stanford.)
The world of investors is a foreign one to most hackers—partly
because investors are so unlike hackers, and partly because they
tend to operate in secret. I've been dealing with this world for
many years, both as a founder and an investor, and I still don't
fully understand it. In this essay I'm going to list some of the more surprising things
I've learned about investors. Some I only learned in the past year. Teaching hackers how to deal with investors is probably the second
most important thing we do at Y Combinator. The most important
thing for a startup is to make something good. But everyone knows
that's important. The dangerous thing about investors is that
hackers don't know how little they know about this strange world. 1. The investors are what make a startup hub. About a year ago I tried to figure out what you'd need to reproduce
Silicon Valley. I decided the
critical ingredients were rich people
and nerds—investors and founders. People are all you need to
make technology, and all the other people will move. If I had to narrow that down, I'd say investors are the limiting
factor. Not because they contribute more to the startup, but simply
because they're least willing to move. They're rich. They're not
going to move to Albuquerque just because there are some smart
hackers there they could invest in. Whereas hackers will move to
the Bay Area to find investors. 2. Angel investors are the most critical. There are several types of investors. The two main categories are
angels and VCs: VCs invest other people's money, and angels invest
their own. Though they're less well known, the angel investors are probably
the more critical ingredient in creating a silicon valley. Most
companies that VCs invest in would never have made it that far if angels
hadn't invested first. VCs say between half and three quarters of
companies that raise series A rounds have taken some outside
investment already. [1]
Angels are willing to fund riskier projects than VCs. They also
give valuable advice, because (unlike VCs) many have been startup
founders themselves. Google's story shows the key role angels play. A lot of people know
Google raised money from Kleiner and Sequoia. What most don't realize
is how late. That VC round was a series B round; the premoney
valuation was $75 million. Google was already a successful company
at that point. Really, Google was funded with angel money. It may seem odd that the canonical Silicon Valley startup was funded
by angels, but this is not so surprising. Risk is always proportionate
to reward. So the most successful startup of all is likely to have
seemed an extremely risky bet at first, and that is exactly the
kind VCs won't touch. Where do angel investors come from? From other startups.","So startup hubs like Silicon Valley benefit from something like the marketplace effect, but shifted in time: startups are there because startups were there. 3. Angels don't like publicity. If angels are so important, why do we hear more about VCs? Because VCs like publicity. They need to market themselves to the investors who are their ""customers""—the endowments and pension funds and rich families whose money they invest—and also to founders who might come to them for funding. Angels don't need to market themselves to investors because they invest their own money. Nor do they want to market themselves to founders: they don't want random people pestering them with business plans. Actually, neither do VCs. Both angels and VCs get deals almost exclusively through personal introductions. [2] The reason VCs want a strong brand is not to draw in more business plans over the transom, but so they win deals when competing against other VCs. Whereas angels are rarely in direct competition, because (a) they do fewer deals, (b) they're happy to split them, and (c) they invest at a point where the stream is broader. 4. Most investors, especially VCs, are not like founders. Some angels are, or were, hackers. But most VCs are a different type of people: they're dealmakers. If you're a hacker, here's a thought experiment you can run to understand why there are basically no hacker VCs: How would you like a job where you never got to make anything, but instead spent all your time listening to other people pitch (mostly terrible) projects, deciding whether to fund them, and sitting on their boards if you did? That would not be fun for most hackers. Hackers like to make things. This would be like being an administrator. Because most VCs are a different species of people from founders, it's hard to know what they're thinking. If you're a hacker, the last time you had to deal with these guys was in high school. Maybe in college you walked past their fraternity on your way to the lab. But don't underestimate them. They're as expert in their world as you are in yours. What they're good at is reading people, and making deals work to their advantage. Think twice before you try to beat them at that. 5. Most investors are momentum investors. Because most investors are dealmakers rather than technology people, they generally don't understand what you're doing. I knew as a founder that most VCs didn't get technology. I also knew some made a lot of money. And yet it never occurred to me till recently to put those two ideas together and ask ""How can VCs make money by investing in stuff they don't understand?"" The answer is that they're like momentum investors. You can (or could once) make a lot of money by noticing sudden changes in stock prices. When a stock jumps upward, you buy, and when it suddenly drops, you sell. In effect you're insider trading, without knowing what you","They are the most valuable people in the startup world.
They are the people who have been through the startup process, and
have the most insight into what it's like to run a startup. 3. The more you know, the more you are in the investor's camp. Investors
are not just people who give you money. They are people who
have a deep understanding of the business and the market. They
have the experience, the connections, and the insight to help
you grow. But they also have a deep understanding of the value of
money. They are not just about money. They are about value. They're about making sure that you are building the right
thing. They're about making sure that the company is growing in the
right way. So, the more you understand the business, the more you
are in the investor's camp. That is the key to being a good investor. 4. The first investor is the most important. This is a common misconception. I think people have a tendency to think that the first investor
is not as important as the second or third. But that's not the case. The first investor is the one who gives you the credibility
that you need to get the next ones. They are the one who gives you the first round of money. Without that first round, you can't get the next ones. If you can't get the first investor, you can't get any. So, the first investor is the most important. 5. The first round is the most important. That's a common misunderstanding. I think people think that the second round is the most important
because that's when the company gets a big boost. But in reality, the first round is the most important. The first round is the one that gets the company off the ground.
It's the one that gives the company the credibility that makes it
possible to get the next rounds. Without the first round,",490,500,330,0.3766,0.1932,0.9354,0.902,0.9269,0.8189,1.0298,-2.3638,0.431,0.3643,0.0559,0.0577,0.0031,0.0065,0.5186,0.6387,0.9648,0.936,0.41415929203539825,0.42449664429530204,0.5039370078740157,7,8,0.9474,0.9948,0.15510204081632653,0.196,0.16363636363636364,0.9284,0.5653,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,Why Nerds are Unpopular.txt,"February 2003
When we were in junior high school, my friend Rich and I made a map
of the school lunch tables according to popularity. This was easy
to do, because kids only ate lunch with others of about the same
popularity. We graded them from A to E. A tables were full of
football players and cheerleaders and so on. E tables contained the
kids with mild cases of Down's Syndrome, what in the language of
the time we called ""retards.""
We sat at a D table, as low as you could get without looking
physically different. We were not being especially candid to grade
ourselves as D. It would have taken a deliberate lie to say otherwise. Everyone in the school knew exactly how popular everyone else was,
including us. My stock gradually rose during high school. Puberty finally arrived;
I became a decent soccer player; I started a scandalous underground
newspaper. So I've seen a good part of the popularity landscape. I know a lot of people who were nerds in school, and they all tell
the same story: there is a strong correlation between being smart
and being a nerd, and an even stronger inverse correlation between
being a nerd and being popular. Being smart seems to make you
unpopular. Why? To someone in school now, that may seem an odd question to
ask. The mere fact is so overwhelming that it may seem strange to
imagine that it could be any other way. But it could. Being smart
doesn't make you an outcast in elementary school. Nor does it harm
you in the real world. Nor, as far as I can tell, is the problem
so bad in most other countries. But in a typical American secondary
school, being smart is likely to make your life difficult. Why? The key to this mystery is to rephrase the question slightly. Why
don't smart kids make themselves popular? If they're so smart, why
don't they figure out how popularity works and beat the system,
just as they do for standardized tests? One argument says that this would be impossible, that the smart
kids are unpopular because the other kids envy them for being smart,
and nothing they could do could make them popular. I wish. If the
other kids in junior high school envied me, they did a great job
of concealing it. And in any case, if being smart were really an
enviable quality, the girls would have broken ranks. The guys that
guys envy, girls like. In the schools I went to, being smart just didn't matter much. Kids
didn't admire it or despise it. All other things being equal, they
would have preferred to be on the smart side of average rather than the
dumb side, but intelligence counted far less than, say, physical
appearance, charisma, or athletic ability. So if intelligence in itself is not a factor in popularity, why are
smart kids so consistently unpopular?","The answer, I think, is that they don't really want to be popular. If someone had told me that at the time, I would have laughed at him. Being unpopular in school makes kids miserable, some of them so miserable that they commit suicide. Telling me that I didn't want to be popular would have seemed like telling someone dying of thirst in a desert that he didn't want a glass of water. Of course I wanted to be popular. But in fact I didn't, not enough. There was something else I wanted more: to be smart. Not simply to do well in school, though that counted for something, but to design beautiful rockets, or to write well, or to understand how to program computers. In general, to make great things. At the time I never tried to separate my wants and weigh them against one another. If I had, I would have seen that being smart was more important. If someone had offered me the chance to be the most popular kid in school, but only at the price of being of average intelligence (humor me here), I wouldn't have taken it. Much as they suffer from their unpopularity, I don't think many nerds would. To them the thought of average intelligence is unbearable. But most kids would take that deal. For half of them, it would be a step up. Even for someone in the eightieth percentile (assuming, as everyone seemed to then, that intelligence is a scalar), who wouldn't drop thirty points in exchange for being loved and admired by everyone? And that, I think, is the root of the problem. Nerds serve two masters. They want to be popular, certainly, but they want even more to be smart. And popularity is not something you can do in your spare time, not in the fiercely competitive environment of an American secondary school. Alberti, arguably the archetype of the Renaissance Man, writes that ""no art, however minor, demands less than total dedication if you want to excel in it."" I wonder if anyone in the world works harder at anything than American school kids work at popularity. Navy SEALs and neurosurgery residents seem slackers by comparison. They occasionally take vacations; some even have hobbies. An American teenager may work at being popular every waking hour, 365 days a year. I don't mean to suggest they do this consciously. Some of them truly are little Machiavellis, but what I really mean here is that teenagers are always on duty as conformists. For example, teenage kids pay a great deal of attention to clothes. They don't consciously dress to be popular. They dress to look good. But to who? To the other kids. Other kids' opinions become their definition of right, not just for clothes, but for almost everything they do, right down to the way they walk. And so every effort they make to do things ""right"" is also, consciously or not, an effort to be more popular. Nerds","I think that it has to do with the
way that people interact. If you're smart, you're not very good at
reading people, and you're not very good at reading the social
rules. You don't know how to play the game. So I think that's the
problem. Not that being smart is bad, but that being smart is
different from being social. You can be smart, and you can be
social, but you have't mastered both. So the problem is not that
the smart kids are different, but that they're not yet
socially adept. The idea that being smart is bad is a myth. It's the idea that
being smart and being social are mutually exclusive that's the
myth. So what's the solution? I think that the solution is to teach kids
how to be social. The problem is not that they're smart, but that
they don't know how to play the game. So, if you're smart, and you
know how to play the game, you can be popular. If you're not smart, but
you know how to play the game, you can be popular. If you're both
smart and know how to play the game, you can be popular. So, it's not that
being smart is bad, but that being smart is different. So, the solution is
to teach kids how to play the game. That's why I think that the
problem is not with the kids, but with the system. The system doesn't teach kids how to be social. It doesn't
teach them to read people, to read social cues, to be assertive,
to be charismatic, or to be charming. So the problem is that the school system has not
taught kids how to play the game. It's not that the kids are bad, but that the system is
bad. So, the solution is to teach kids",493,500,309,0.3352,0.3074,0.9615,0.9185,0.9877,0.9993,-0.1754,-0.0099,0.4147,0.3533,0.057,0.0582,0.0029,0.0102,0.7766,0.6341,0.9715,0.9488,0.450530035335689,0.4440677966101695,0.5361930294906166,5,4,0.9906,0.9242,0.15212981744421908,0.18,0.21035598705501618,0.9249,0.4442,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,Mean People Fail.txt,"November 2014
It struck me recently how few of the most successful people I know
are mean. There are exceptions, but remarkably few. Meanness isn't rare. In fact, one of the things the internet has
shown us is how mean people can be. A few decades ago, only famous
people and professional writers got to publish their opinions. Now
everyone can, and we can all see the long tail of
meanness that had previously been hidden. And yet while there are clearly a lot of mean people out there,
there are next to none among the most successful people I know. What's going on here? Are meanness and success inversely correlated? Part of what's going on, of course, is selection bias. I only know
people who work in certain fields: startup founders, programmers,
professors. I'm willing to believe that successful people in other
fields are mean. Maybe successful hedge fund managers are mean; I
don't know enough to say. It seems quite likely that most successful
drug lords are mean. But there are at least big chunks of the world
that mean people don't rule, and that territory seems to be growing. My wife and Y Combinator cofounder Jessica is one of those rare
people who have x-ray vision for character. Being married to her
is like standing next to an airport baggage scanner. She came to
the startup world from investment banking, and she has always been
struck both by how consistently successful startup founders turn
out to be good people, and how consistently bad people fail as
startup founders. Why? I think there are several reasons. One is that being mean
makes you stupid. That's why I hate fights. You never do your best
work in a fight, because fights are not sufficiently general. Winning is always a function of the situation and the people involved. You don't win fights by thinking of big ideas but by thinking of
tricks that work in one particular case. And yet fighting is just
as much work as thinking about real problems. Which is particularly
painful to someone who cares how their brain is used: your brain
goes fast but you get nowhere, like a car spinning its wheels. Startups don't win by attacking. They win by transcending. There
are exceptions of course, but usually the way to win is to race
ahead, not to stop and fight. Another reason mean founders lose is that they can't get the best
people to work for them. They can hire people who will put up with
them because they need a job. But the best people have other options. A mean person can't convince the best people to work for him unless
he is super convincing. And while having the best people helps any
organization, it's critical for startups. There is also a complementary force at work: if you want to build
great things, it helps to be driven by a spirit of benevolence.","The startup founders who end up richest are not the ones driven by money. The ones driven by money take the big acquisition offer that nearly every successful startup gets en route. [1] The ones who keep going are driven by something else. They may not say so explicitly, but they're usually trying to improve the world. Which means people with a desire to improve the world have a natural advantage. [2] The exciting thing is that startups are not just one random type of work in which meanness and success are inversely correlated. This kind of work is the future. For most of history success meant control of scarce resources. One got that by fighting, whether literally in the case of pastoral nomads driving hunter-gatherers into marginal lands, or metaphorically in the case of Gilded Age financiers contending with one another to assemble railroad monopolies. For most of history, success meant success at zero-sum games. And in most of them meanness was not a handicap but probably an advantage. That is changing. Increasingly the games that matter are not zero-sum. Increasingly you win not by fighting to get control of a scarce resource, but by having new ideas and building new things. [3] There have long been games where you won by having new ideas. In the third century BC, Archimedes won by doing that. At least until an invading Roman army killed him. Which illustrates why this change is happening: for new ideas to matter, you need a certain degree of civil order. And not just not being at war. You also need to prevent the sort of economic violence that nineteenth century magnates practiced against one another and communist countries practiced against their citizens. People need to feel that what they create can't be stolen. [4] That has always been the case for thinkers, which is why this trend began with them. When you think of successful people from history who weren't ruthless, you get mathematicians and writers and artists. The exciting thing is that their m.o. seems to be spreading. The games played by intellectuals are leaking into the real world, and this is reversing the historical polarity of the relationship between meanness and success. So I'm really glad I stopped to think about this. Jessica and I have always worked hard to teach our kids not to be mean. We tolerate noise and mess and junk food, but not meanness. And now I have both an additional reason to crack down on it, and an additional argument to use when I do: that being mean makes you fail. Notes [1] I'm not saying all founders who take big acquisition offers are driven only by money, but rather that those who don't aren't. Plus one can have benevolent motives for being driven by money — for example, to take care of one's family, or to be free to work on projects that improve the world. [2] It's unlikely that every successful startup improves the world. But","If you're
driven by a spirit of benevolence, you're more likely to be
collaborative. You're more likely to listen to other people. You're more likely to be kind. And that's a good thing. So if you want to be a successful startup founder, you need to be
good, not just smart. In the end, it's about how you use your brain. You can be smart and
mean, but that's a recipe for failure. If you're smart and kind, you'll be more likely to build something
great. So the real question is: how do you use your brain? It's not about how big your brain is. It's about how you use it. The problem is that in our culture, we're not good at using our
brains. We're not good at using our brains in the right way. We're not good at using our brains to think about the
future, or to think about the bigger picture. We're not good at using our brains to think about what's right
and what's wrong. We're not good at using our brains to think about what's
important. We're not good at using our brains to think about how to
solve problems. We're not good at using our brains to think about the
long-term. We're not good at using our brains to think about what's
harmful. We're not good at using our brains to think about what's
helpful. We're not good at using our brains to think about what's
harmful. We're not good at using our brains to think about what's
helpful. So the conclusion is: if you want to be successful, you have to
start thinking about the future, about the bigger picture, about
what's right, what's wrong, what's important, what's helpful, what's
harmful, and what's going to",491,500,293,0.2787,0.089,0.9644,0.9092,0.957,0.9787,0.6286,0.3043,0.4141,0.2911,0.0472,0.0385,0.007,0.0094,0.4583,0.3439,0.9796,0.9166,0.4295900178253119,0.4308231173380035,0.4891304347826087,7,2,0.9681,0.8172,0.1446028513238289,0.15,0.2593856655290102,0.9801,0.4661,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,Early Work.txt,"October 2020
One of the biggest things holding people back from doing great work
is the fear of making something lame. And this fear is not an
irrational one. Many great projects go through a stage early on
where they don't seem very impressive, even to their creators. You
have to push through this stage to reach the great work that lies
beyond. But many people don't. Most people don't even reach the
stage of making something they're embarrassed by, let alone continue
past it. They're too frightened even to start. Imagine if we could turn off the fear of making something lame. Imagine how much more we'd do. Is there any hope of turning it off? I think so. I think the habits
at work here are not very deeply rooted. Making new things is itself a new thing for us as a species. It has
always happened, but till the last few centuries it happened so
slowly as to be invisible to individual humans. And since we didn't
need customs for dealing with new ideas, we didn't develop any. We just don't have enough experience with early versions of ambitious
projects to know how to respond to them. We judge them as we would
judge more finished work, or less ambitious projects. We don't
realize they're a special case. Or at least, most of us don't. One reason I'm confident we can do
better is that it's already starting to happen. There are already
a few places that are living in the future in this respect. Silicon
Valley is one of them: an unknown person working on a strange-sounding
idea won't automatically be dismissed the way they would back home. In Silicon Valley, people have learned how dangerous that is. The right way to deal with new ideas is to treat them as a challenge
to your imagination — not just to have lower standards, but to
switch polarity entirely, from listing
the reasons an idea won't
work to trying to think of ways it could. That's what I do when I
meet people with new ideas. I've become quite good at it, but I've
had a lot of practice. Being a partner at Y Combinator means being
practically immersed in strange-sounding ideas proposed by unknown
people. Every six months you get thousands of new ones thrown at
you and have to sort through them, knowing that in a world with a
power-law distribution of outcomes, it will be painfully obvious
if you miss the needle in this haystack. Optimism becomes
urgent. But I'm hopeful that, with time, this kind of optimism can become
widespread enough that it becomes a social custom, not just a trick
used by a few specialists. It is after all an extremely lucrative
trick, and those tend to spread quickly. Of course, inexperience is not the only reason people are too harsh
on early versions of ambitious projects. They also do it to seem
clever.","And in a field where the new ideas are risky, like startups, those who dismiss them are in fact more likely to be right. Just not when their predictions are weighted by outcome . But there is another more sinister reason people dismiss new ideas. If you try something ambitious, many of those around you will hope, consciously or unconsciously, that you'll fail. They worry that if you try something ambitious and succeed, it will put you above them. In some countries this is not just an individual failing but part of the national culture. I wouldn't claim that people in Silicon Valley overcome these impulses because they're morally better. [1] The reason many hope you'll succeed is that they hope to rise with you. For investors this incentive is particularly explicit. They want you to succeed because they hope you'll make them rich in the process. But many other people you meet can hope to benefit in some way from your success. At the very least they'll be able to say, when you're famous, that they've known you since way back. But even if Silicon Valley's encouraging attitude is rooted in self-interest, it has over time actually grown into a sort of benevolence. Encouraging startups has been practiced for so long that it has become a custom. Now it just seems that that's what one does with startups. Maybe Silicon Valley is too optimistic. Maybe it's too easily fooled by impostors. Many less optimistic journalists want to believe that. But the lists of impostors they cite are suspiciously short, and plagued with asterisks. [2] If you use revenue as the test, Silicon Valley's optimism seems better tuned than the rest of the world's. And because it works, it will spread. There's a lot more to new ideas than new startup ideas, of course. The fear of making something lame holds people back in every field. But Silicon Valley shows how quickly customs can evolve to support new ideas. And that in turn proves that dismissing new ideas is not so deeply rooted in human nature that it can't be unlearnt. ___________ Unfortunately, if you want to do new things, you'll face a force more powerful than other people's skepticism: your own skepticism. You too will judge your early work too harshly. How do you avoid that? This is a difficult problem, because you don't want to completely eliminate your horror of making something lame. That's what steers you toward doing good work. You just want to turn it off temporarily, the way a painkiller temporarily turns off pain. People have already discovered several techniques that work. Hardy mentions two in A Mathematician's Apology: Good work is not done by ""humble"" men. It is one of the first duties of a professor, for example, in any subject, to exaggerate a little both the importance of his subject and his importance in it. If you overestimate the importance of what you're working on, that will compensate for your mistakenly harsh judgment","People are often more comfortable with their own views than with
others. So, to be clear, I'm not saying we should be less critical. I'm saying we should be more
curious. We should be more curious about what people are trying to do, and more
curious about the early versions of their ideas. If we do that, we'll have a much better chance of finding the
good ideas and the good people who are working on them. The question is, how can we get more curious? I think the answer is to treat the early versions of ambitious
projects as a kind of challenge, not just a chance to be
critical. This is the same as what I said earlier, but I'm saying it
again to emphasize that this is the key to turning off the fear
of making something lame. So, the fear of making something lame is a
natural reaction to the unknown. It's not irrational. But if we can learn to think of early versions as a
challenge, not as a threat, we can turn off the fear. The more we do that, the less we fear, the more we can do. We can do more, and we can do better. We can do more, and we can do better.
October 2020
The key takeaway is that the fear of making something lame is a natural reaction to the unknown, but by reframing early versions of ambitious projects as challenges rather than threats, we can overcome this fear and achieve more. This is a process that can become a social custom, as seen in places like Silicon Valley, where the culture of embracing new ideas and treating them as challenges has led to innovation and success. The author suggests that by fostering curiosity and a willingness to engage with early versions of ideas, we can improve our ability to find good ideas and good people, ultimately leading to greater innovation and progress.

Paul Graham,The Anatomy of Determination .txt,"Want to start a startup? Get funded by
Y Combinator. September 2009
Like all investors, we spend a lot of time trying to learn how to
predict which startups will succeed. We probably spend more time
thinking about it than most, because we invest the earliest. Prediction is usually all we have to rely on. We learned quickly that the most important predictor of success is
determination. At first we thought it might be intelligence. Everyone likes to believe that's what makes startups succeed. It
makes a better story that a company won because its founders were
so smart. The PR people and reporters who spread such stories
probably believe them themselves. But while it certainly helps to
be smart, it's not the deciding factor. There are plenty of people
as smart as Bill Gates who achieve nothing. In most domains, talent is overrated compared to determination—partly
because it makes a better story, partly because it gives onlookers
an excuse for being lazy, and partly because after a while determination
starts to look like talent. I can't think of any field in which determination is overrated, but
the relative importance of determination and talent probably do
vary somewhat. Talent probably matters more in types of work that
are purer, in the sense that one is solving mostly a single type
of problem instead of many different types. I suspect determination
would not take you as far in math as it would in, say, organized
crime. I don't mean to suggest by this comparison that types of work that
depend more on talent are always more admirable. Most people would
agree it's more admirable to be good at math than memorizing long
strings of digits, even though the latter depends more on natural
ability. Perhaps one reason people believe startup founders win by being
smarter is that intelligence does matter more in technology startups
than it used to in earlier types of companies. You probably do
need to be a bit smarter to dominate Internet search than you had
to be to dominate railroads or hotels or newspapers. And that's
probably an ongoing trend. But even in the highest of high tech
industries, success still depends more on determination than brains. If determination is so important, can we isolate its components? Are some more important than others? Are there some you can
cultivate? The simplest form of determination is sheer willfulness. When you
want something, you must have it, no matter what. A good deal of willfulness must be inborn, because it's common to
see families where one sibling has much more of it than another. Circumstances can alter it, but at the high end of the scale, nature
seems to be more important than nurture. Bad circumstances can
break the spirit of a strong-willed person, but I don't think there's
much you can do to make a weak-willed person stronger-willed. Being strong-willed is not enough, however. You also have to be
hard on yourself.","Someone who was strong-willed but self-indulgent would not be called determined. Determination implies your willfulness is balanced by discipline. That word balance is a significant one. The more willful you are, the more disciplined you have to be. The stronger your will, the less anyone will be able to argue with you except yourself. And someone has to argue with you, because everyone has base impulses, and if you have more will than discipline you'll just give into them and end up on a local maximum like drug addiction. We can imagine will and discipline as two fingers squeezing a slippery melon seed. The harder they squeeze, the further the seed flies, but they must both squeeze equally or the seed spins off sideways. If this is true it has interesting implications, because discipline can be cultivated, and in fact does tend to vary quite a lot in the course of an individual's life. If determination is effectively the product of will and discipline, then you can become more determined by being more disciplined. [1] Another consequence of the melon seed model is that the more willful you are, the more dangerous it is to be undisciplined. There seem to be plenty of examples to confirm that. In some very energetic people's lives you see something like wing flutter, where they alternate between doing great work and doing absolutely nothing. Externally this would look a lot like bipolar disorder. The melon seed model is inaccurate in at least one respect, however: it's static. In fact the dangers of indiscipline increase with temptation. Which means, interestingly, that determination tends to erode itself. If you're sufficiently determined to achieve great things, this will probably increase the number of temptations around you. Unless you become proportionally more disciplined, willfulness will then get the upper hand, and your achievement will revert to the mean. That's why Shakespeare's Caesar thought thin men so dangerous. They weren't tempted by the minor perquisites of power. The melon seed model implies it's possible to be too disciplined. Is it? I think there probably are people whose willfulness is crushed down by excessive discipline, and who would achieve more if they weren't so hard on themselves. One reason the young sometimes succeed where the old fail is that they don't realize how incompetent they are. This lets them do a kind of deficit spending. When they first start working on something, they overrate their achievements. But that gives them confidence to keep working, and their performance improves. Whereas someone clearer-eyed would see their initial incompetence for what it was, and perhaps be discouraged from continuing. There's one other major component of determination: ambition. If willfulness and discipline are what get you to your destination, ambition is how you choose it. I don't know if it's exactly right to say that ambition is a component of determination, but they're not entirely orthogonal. It would seem a misnomer if someone said they were very determined to do something trivially easy. And","That is, you have to be able to take
criticism, and you have to be able to work when you're not
motivated. You can be strong-willed but not very hard on yourself. If you
want to be a startup founder, you need to be both. So what's the role of intelligence? The most important
thing is that you are intelligent enough to realize that you need
to be determined. If you're too dumb to realize that, you'll never be a startup
founder. I think intelligence is more important in the early stages of a
startup, but not as important as determination. So even if you are a genius, if you don't have the determination
to get things done, you will fail. But if you're not smart enough to understand that you need
determination, you will also fail. The most important thing is to be determined. The author of the passage is a member of

Paul Graham,Earnestness.txt,"December 2020
Jessica and I have certain words that have special significance
when we're talking about startups. The highest compliment we can
pay to founders is to describe them as ""earnest."" This is not by
itself a guarantee of success. You could be earnest but incapable. But when founders are both formidable (another of our words) and
earnest, they're as close to unstoppable as you get. Earnestness sounds like a boring, even Victorian virtue. It seems
a bit of an anachronism that people in Silicon Valley would care
about it. Why does this matter so much? When you call someone earnest, you're making a statement about their
motives. It means both that they're doing something for the right
reasons, and that they're trying as hard as they can. If we imagine
motives as vectors, it means both the direction and the magnitude
are right. Though these are of course related: when people are doing
something for the right reasons, they try harder. [1]
The reason motives matter so much in Silicon Valley is that so many
people there have the wrong ones. Starting a successful startup
makes you rich and famous. So a lot of the people trying to start
them are doing it for those reasons. Instead of what? Instead of
interest in the problem for its own sake. That is the root of
earnestness. [2]
It's also the hallmark of a nerd. Indeed, when people describe
themselves as ""x nerds,"" what they mean is that they're interested
in x for its own sake, and not because it's cool to be interested
in x, or because of what they can get from it. They're saying they
care so much about x that they're willing to sacrifice seeming cool
for its sake. A genuine interest
in something is a very powerful motivator — for
some people, the most powerful motivator of all. [3]
Which is why
it's what Jessica and I look for in founders. But as well as being
a source of strength, it's also a source of vulnerability. Caring
constrains you. The earnest can't easily reply in kind to mocking
banter, or put on a cool facade of nihil admirari. They care too
much. They are doomed to be the straight man. That's a real
disadvantage in your
teenage years ,
when mocking banter and nihil
admirari often have the upper hand. But it becomes an advantage
later. It's a commonplace now that the kids who were
nerds in high school
become the cool kids' bosses later on. But people misunderstand why
this happens. It's not just because the nerds are smarter, but also
because they're more earnest. When the problems get harder than the
fake ones you're given in high school, caring about them starts to
matter. Does it always matter? Do the earnest always win? Not always.","It probably doesn't matter much in politics, or in crime, or in certain types of business that are similar to crime, like gambling, personal injury law, patent trolling, and so on. Nor does it matter in academic fields at the more bogus end of the spectrum. And though I don't know enough to say for sure, it may not matter in some kinds of humor: it may be possible to be completely cynical and still be very funny. [4] Looking at the list of fields I mentioned, there's an obvious pattern. Except possibly for humor, these are all types of work I'd avoid like the plague. So that could be a useful heuristic for deciding which fields to work in: how much does earnestness matter? Which can in turn presumably be inferred from the prevalence of nerds at the top. Along with ""nerd,"" another word that tends to be associated with earnestness is ""naive."" The earnest often seem naive. It's not just that they don't have the motives other people have. They often don't fully grasp that such motives exist. Or they may know intellectually that they do, but because they don't feel them, they forget about them. [5] It works to be slightly naive not just about motives but also, believe it or not, about the problems you're working on. Naive optimism can compensate for the bit rot that rapid change causes in established beliefs. You plunge into some problem saying ""How hard can it be?"", and then after solving it you learn that it was till recently insoluble. Naivete is an obstacle for anyone who wants to seem sophisticated, and this is one reason would-be intellectuals find it so difficult to understand Silicon Valley. It hasn't been safe for such people to use the word ""earnest"" outside scare quotes since Oscar Wilde wrote ""The Importance of Being Earnest"" in 1895. And yet when you zoom in on Silicon Valley, right into Jessica Livingston's brain , that's what her x-ray vision is seeking out in founders. Earnestness! Who'd have guessed? Reporters literally can't believe it when founders making piles of money say that they started their companies to make the world better. The situation seems made for mockery. How can these founders be so naive as not to realize how implausible they sound? Though those asking this question don't realize it, that's not a rhetorical question. A lot of founders are faking it, of course, particularly the smaller fry, and the soon to be smaller fry. But not all of them. There are a significant number of founders who really are interested in the problem they're solving mainly for its own sake. Why shouldn't there be? We have no difficulty believing that people would be interested in history or math or even old bus tickets for their own sake. Why can't there be people interested in self-driving cars or social networks for their own sake? When you look at the question from this side, it seems obvious there would","But they
are more likely to be the ones who do. [4]
When we look at the people who have made the most impact in
the world, the ones who have changed the world in a meaningful
way, they are the earnest. They are the ones who have been
unshakable in their conviction. They are the ones who have
never given up. They are the ones who have not been swayed by the
fleeting winds of popularity and trend. The ones who are
not impressed by the coolness of things, and who are
not intimidated by the loudness of the crowd. [5]
And the ones who have not been afraid of the consequences. [6]
So, the point is that earnestness is a strength. But it's also a
vulnerability. It's not a quality that can be easily
disregarded or dismissed. It's not something that can be
hyped up. It's a quality that requires time, patience, and a lot
of work to develop. It's a quality that can be tested and
measured. It's not a quality that can be measured by a
scorecard, but it can be measured by the results you get from
it. [7]

Paul Graham,Heresy.txt,"April 2022
One of the most surprising things I've witnessed in my lifetime is
the rebirth of the concept of heresy. In his excellent biography of Newton, Richard Westfall writes about the
moment when he was elected a fellow of Trinity College:
Supported comfortably, Newton was free to devote himself wholly
to whatever he chose. To remain on, he had only to avoid the three
unforgivable sins: crime, heresy, and marriage. [1]
The first time I read that, in the 1990s, it sounded amusingly
medieval. How strange, to have to avoid committing heresy. But when
I reread it 20 years later it sounded like a description of
contemporary employment. There are an ever-increasing number of opinions you can be fired
for. Those doing the firing don't use the word ""heresy"" to describe
them, but structurally they're equivalent. Structurally there are
two distinctive things about heresy: (1) that it takes priority
over the question of truth or falsity, and (2) that it outweighs
everything else the speaker has done. For example, when someone calls a statement ""x-ist,"" they're also
implicitly saying that this is the end of the discussion. They do
not, having said this, go on to consider whether the statement is
true or not. Using such labels is the conversational equivalent of
signalling an exception. That's one of the reasons they're used:
to end a discussion. If you find yourself talking to someone who uses these labels a
lot, it might be worthwhile to ask them explicitly if they believe
any babies are being thrown out with the bathwater. Can a statement
be x-ist, for whatever value of x, and also true? If the answer is
yes, then they're admitting to banning the truth. That's obvious
enough that I'd guess most would answer no. But if they answer no,
it's easy to show that they're mistaken, and that in practice such
labels are applied to statements regardless of their truth or
falsity. The clearest evidence of this is that whether a statement is
considered x-ist often depends on who said it. Truth doesn't work
that way. The same statement can't be true when one person says it,
but x-ist, and therefore false, when another person does. [2]
The other distinctive thing about heresies, compared to ordinary
opinions, is that the public expression of them outweighs everything
else the speaker has done. In ordinary matters, like knowledge of
history, or taste in music, you're judged by the average of your
opinions. A heresy is qualitatively different. It's like dropping
a chunk of uranium onto the scale. Back in the day (and still, in some places) the punishment for
heresy was death. You could have led a life of exemplary goodness,
but if you publicly doubted, say, the divinity of Christ, you were
going to burn. Nowadays, in civilized countries, heretics only get
fired in the metaphorical sense, by losing their jobs. But the
structure of the situation is the same: the heresy
outweighs everything else.","You could have spent the last ten years saving children's lives, but if you express certain opinions, you're automatically fired. It's much the same as if you committed a crime. No matter how virtuously you've lived, if you commit a crime, you must still suffer the penalty of the law. Having lived a previously blameless life might mitigate the punishment, but it doesn't affect whether you're guilty or not. A heresy is an opinion whose expression is treated like a crime — one that makes some people feel not merely that you're mistaken, but that you should be punished. Indeed, their desire to see you punished is often stronger than it would be if you'd committed an actual crime. There are many on the far left who believe strongly in the reintegration of felons (as I do myself), and yet seem to feel that anyone guilty of certain heresies should never work again. There are always some heresies — some opinions you'd be punished for expressing. But there are a lot more now than there were a few decades ago, and even those who are happy about this would have to agree that it's so. Why? Why has this antiquated-sounding religious concept come back in a secular form? And why now? You need two ingredients for a wave of intolerance: intolerant people, and an ideology to guide them. The intolerant people are always there. They exist in every sufficiently large society. That's why waves of intolerance can arise so suddenly; all they need is something to set them off. I've already written an essay describing the aggressively conventional-minded. The short version is that people can be classified in two dimensions according to (1) how independent- or conventional-minded they are, and (2) how aggressive they are about it. The aggressively conventional-minded are the enforcers of orthodoxy. Normally they're only locally visible. They're the grumpy, censorious people in a group — the ones who are always first to complain when something violates the current rules of propriety. But occasionally, like a vector field whose elements become aligned, a large number of aggressively conventional-minded people unite behind some ideology all at once. Then they become much more of a problem, because a mob dynamic takes over, where the enthusiasm of each participant is increased by the enthusiasm of the others. The most notorious 20th century case may have been the Cultural Revolution. Though initiated by Mao to undermine his rivals, the Cultural Revolution was otherwise mostly a grass-roots phenomenon. Mao said in essence: There are heretics among us. Seek them out and punish them. And that's all the aggressively conventional-minded ever need to hear. They went at it with the delight of dogs chasing squirrels. To unite the conventional-minded, an ideology must have many of the features of a religion. In particular it must have strict and arbitrary rules that adherents can demonstrate their purity by obeying, and its adherents must believe that anyone who obeys these rules is ipso facto morally superior","So when a person is
fired for an opinion, we can think of it as a metaphorical
heresy. In the same way that in the past, people were burned for
heresy, they are now dismissed for heresy. [3]
The most interesting thing about this is that the person who is
fired is not necessarily the one who is wrong. In the case of
Newton, for example, he was not wrong in the sense that he was not
heretical. He was a very good man, a man of great integrity. But he was
fired from his position not for being wrong, but for being
different. [4] [5]
The point is that the heresy concept is not about being wrong, but
about being different. It's not that you are wrong in your
opinions, but that you are different from the group. So, for
example, if I say that the sun goes around the earth, and someone
else says that the earth goes around the sun, then I'm not
heretical, if I believe that the earth is flat. But if I believe in
the heliocentric model, I am heretical. [6] [7]
So the problem is that the group has a way of labeling others as
heretics, and this is not about their beliefs, but about their
differences. It's not about whether the beliefs are correct or not, but
about whether they are different. The difference is what's
important. [8]

Paul Graham,What You Can't Say.txt,"January 2004
Have you ever seen an old photo of yourself and
been embarrassed at the way you looked? Did we actually
dress like that? We did. And we had no idea how
silly we looked. It's the nature of fashion to be invisible, in the
same way the movement of the earth is invisible to all
of us riding on it. What scares me is that there are moral fashions too. They're just as arbitrary, and just as invisible to most people. But they're much more dangerous. Fashion is mistaken for good design;
moral fashion is mistaken for good. Dressing oddly gets you laughed at. Violating
moral fashions can get you fired, ostracized, imprisoned, or
even killed. If you could travel back in a time machine, one thing
would be true no matter where you went: you'd have to watch
what you said. Opinions we consider harmless could have
gotten you in big trouble. I've already said at least one thing that would have gotten me in big
trouble in most of Europe in the seventeenth century,
and did get Galileo in big trouble when he said
it — that the earth moves. [1]
It seems to be a constant throughout history: In every
period, people believed things that were just ridiculous,
and believed them so strongly that you would have gotten in
terrible trouble for saying otherwise. Is our time any different? To anyone who has read any amount of history, the answer is
almost certainly no. It would be a remarkable coincidence if ours
were the first era to get everything just right. It's tantalizing to think we believe
things that people in the future will find ridiculous. What would someone coming back to visit us in a time machine
have to be careful not to say? That's what I want to study here. But
I want to do more than just shock everyone with
the heresy du jour. I want to find general
recipes for discovering what you can't say, in any era. The Conformist Test
Let's start with a test:
Do you have any opinions that you would be reluctant to express
in front of a group of your peers? If the answer is no,
you might want to stop and think about that. If everything
you believe is something you're supposed to believe, could
that possibly be a coincidence? Odds are it isn't. Odds are
you just think what you're told. The other alternative would be that you independently considered
every question and came up with the exact same answers that
are now considered acceptable. That seems unlikely, because
you'd also have to make the same mistakes. Mapmakers
deliberately put slight mistakes in their maps so they can
tell when someone copies them. If another map has the same
mistake, that's very convincing evidence. Like every other era in history, our moral map almost certainly
contains a few mistakes. And anyone who makes the same mistakes
probably didn't do it by accident.","It would be like someone claiming they had independently decided in 1972 that bell-bottom jeans were a good idea. If you believe everything you're supposed to now, how can you be sure you wouldn't also have believed everything you were supposed to if you had grown up among the plantation owners of the pre-Civil War South, or in Germany in the 1930s — or among the Mongols in 1200, for that matter? Odds are you would have. Back in the era of terms like ""well-adjusted,"" the idea seemed to be that there was something wrong with you if you thought things you didn't dare say out loud. This seems backward. Almost certainly, there is something wrong with you if you don't think things you don't dare say out loud. Trouble What can't we say? One way to find these ideas is simply to look at things people do say, and get in trouble for. [2] Of course, we're not just looking for things we can't say. We're looking for things we can't say that are true, or at least have enough chance of being true that the question should remain open. But many of the things people get in trouble for saying probably do make it over this second, lower threshold. No one gets in trouble for saying that 2 + 2 is 5, or that people in Pittsburgh are ten feet tall. Such obviously false statements might be treated as jokes, or at worst as evidence of insanity, but they are not likely to make anyone mad. The statements that make people mad are the ones they worry might be believed. I suspect the statements that make people maddest are those they worry might be true. If Galileo had said that people in Padua were ten feet tall, he would have been regarded as a harmless eccentric. Saying the earth orbited the sun was another matter. The church knew this would set people thinking. Certainly, as we look back on the past, this rule of thumb works well. A lot of the statements people got in trouble for seem harmless now. So it's likely that visitors from the future would agree with at least some of the statements that get people in trouble today. Do we have no Galileos? Not likely. To find them, keep track of opinions that get people in trouble, and start asking, could this be true? Ok, it may be heretical (or whatever modern equivalent), but might it also be true? Heresy This won't get us all the answers, though. What if no one happens to have gotten in trouble for a particular idea yet? What if some idea would be so radioactively controversial that no one would dare express it in public? How can we find these too? Another approach is to follow that word, heresy. In every period of history, there seem to have been labels that got applied to statements to shoot them down before anyone had a chance to ask if","So, the Conformist Test is a way to see if you're just
passively accepting what you're told, rather than
thinking through for yourself. It's a test that's
intended to show you that you are not really
thinking. The problem with most people is that they think
they are thinking, but they are not. The Conformist Test is a test that
is not for the faint of heart. It's a test that requires you to actually
think through what you're saying. It's not just a test of
what you think, but a test of whether you think. This is a test that is not for the faint of heart. The Conformist Test is a way to see if you're just
passively accepting what you're told, rather than
thinking through for yourself. It's a test that's
intended to show you that you are not really
thinking. [2]
The test is simple. You have to ask yourself: What is the
most important thing that you believe? What do you believe it to be? Why do you believe it? What would happen if someone else said it? What would happen if someone else said the opposite? What would happen if you said it? What would happen if you said the opposite? What would happen if you said something else? What would happen if you said nothing at all? These are the kinds of questions that you have to ask yourself. And
they're not just questions about what you believe, but
questions about whether you believe. They're not just questions about what you think, but
questions about whether you think. [3]
These questions are designed to force you to
think critically. They are not just questions about
what you believe, but about whether you believe. They are not just questions about what you think, but
about whether you think. [4]

of the conversation). It's an interesting illustration of an element
of the startup ecosystem that few except the participants ever see:
investors trying to convince one another to invest in their portfolio
companies. Hundreds if not thousands of conversations of this type
are happening now, but if one has ever been published, I haven't
seen it. The Airbnbs themselves never even saw these emails at the
time. We do a lot of this behind the scenes stuff at YC, because we invest
in such a large number of companies, and we invest so early that
investors sometimes need a lot of convincing to see their merits. I don't always try as hard as this though. Fred must
have found me quite annoying. from: Paul Graham

One of the startups from the batch that just started, AirbedAndBreakfast,
is in NYC right now meeting their users. (NYC is their biggest
market.) I'd recommend meeting them if your schedule allows. I'd been thinking to myself that though these guys were going to
do really well, I should introduce them to angels, because VCs would
never go for it. But then I thought maybe I should give you more
credit. You'll certainly like meeting them. Be sure to ask about
how they funded themselves with breakfast cereal. There's no reason this couldn't be as big as Ebay. And this team
is the right one to do it. --pg

Paul Graham,A New Venture Animal.txt,"March 2008, rev May 2013
(This essay grew out of something I wrote for myself to figure
out what we do. Even though Y Combinator is now 3 years old, we're still
trying to understand its implications.)
I was annoyed recently to read a description of Y Combinator that
said ""Y Combinator does seed funding for startups."" What was
especially annoying about it was that I wrote it. This doesn't
really convey what we do. And the reason it's inaccurate is that,
paradoxically, funding very early stage startups is not mainly about
funding. Saying YC does seed funding for startups is a description in terms
of earlier models. It's like calling a car a horseless carriage. When you scale animals you can't just keep everything in proportion. For example, volume grows as the cube of linear dimension, but
surface area only as the square. So as animals get bigger they
have trouble radiating heat. That's why mice and rabbits are furry
and elephants and hippos aren't. You can't make a mouse by scaling
down an elephant. YC represents a new, smaller kind of animal—so much smaller
that all the rules are different. Before us, most companies in the startup funding business were
venture capital funds. VCs generally fund later stage companies
than we do. And they supply so much money that, even though the
other things they do may be very valuable, it's not that inaccurate
to regard VCs as sources of money. Good VCs are ""smart money,"" but
they're still money. All good investors supply a combination of money and help. But
these scale differently, just as volume and surface area do. Late
stage investors supply huge amounts of money and
comparatively little help: when a company about to go public gets
a mezzanine round of $50 million, the deal tends to be almost
entirely about money. As you move earlier in the venture
funding process, the ratio of help to money increases, because
earlier stage companies have different needs. Early stage companies
need less money because they're smaller and cheaper to run, but
they need more help because life is so precarious for them. So
when VCs do a series A round for, say, $2 million, they generally
expect to offer a significant amount of help along with the money. Y Combinator occupies the earliest end of the spectrum. We're at
least one and generally two steps before VC funding. (Though some
startups go straight from YC to VC, the most common trajectory is
to do an angel round first.) And what happens at Y Combinator is
as different from what happens in a series A round as a series A
round is from a mezzanine financing. At our end, money is almost a negligible factor. The startup usually
consists of just the founders. Their living expenses are the
company's main expense, and since most founders are under 30, their
living expenses are low. But at this early stage companies need a
lot of help.","Practically every question is still unanswered. Some companies we've funded have been working on their software for a year or more, but others haven't decided what to work on, or even who the founders should be. When PR people and journalists recount the histories of startups after they've become big, they always underestimate how uncertain things were at first. They're not being deliberately misleading. When you look at a company like Google, it's hard to imagine they could once have been small and helpless. Sure, at one point they were a just a couple guys in a garage—but even then their greatness was assured, and all they had to do was roll forward along the railroad tracks of destiny. Far from it. A lot of startups with just as promising beginnings end up failing. Google has such momentum now that it would be hard for anyone to stop them. But all it would have taken in the beginning would have been for two Google employees to focus on the wrong things for six months, and the company could have died. We know, because we've been there, just how vulnerable startups are in the earliest phases. Curiously enough, that's why founders tend to get so rich from them. Reward is always proportionate to risk, and very early stage startups are insanely risky. What we really do at Y Combinator is get startups launched straight. One of many metaphors you could use for YC is a steam catapult on an aircraft carrier. We get startups airborne. Barely airborne, but enough that they can accelerate fast. When you're launching planes they have to be set up properly or you're just launching projectiles. They have to be pointed straight down the deck; the wings have to be trimmed properly; the engines have to be at full power; the pilot has to be ready. These are the kind of problems we deal with. After we fund startups we work closely with them for three months—so closely in fact that we insist they move to where we are. And what we do in those three months is make sure everything is set up for launch. If there are tensions between cofounders we help sort them out. We get all the paperwork set up properly so there are no nasty surprises later. If the founders aren't sure what to focus on first, we try to figure that out. If there is some obstacle right in front of them, we either try to remove it, or shift the startup sideways. The goal is to get every distraction out of the way so the founders can use that time to build (or finish building) something impressive. And then near the end of the three months we push the button on the steam catapult in the form of Demo Day, where the current group of startups present to pretty much every investor in Silicon Valley. Launching companies isn't identical with launching products. Though we do spend a lot of time","They need help with everything: from
product development to marketing, from legal to accounting. They need
help with building a business. So we don't fund them. We help them. And we
help them in a very different way than VCs do. We don't just
give them money. We give them a 7% equity stake in exchange for their
time. We give them a place to live, a community, and a
network of people. We give them a process. We give them
structure. We give them the opportunity to learn. We give them a
platform. We give them access to the best people in the world in
the tech and business fields. And we give them a chance to build a company that has
a real chance of success. We don't just give them money, because that's not what they
need. They don't need money. They need help. So, in that sense, Y Combinator is not a venture capital fund.
It's not a traditional startup funding company. It's not a
seed fund. It's a startup incubator. The term ""incubator"" is more accurate. We're not trying to
finance startups. We're trying to help startups become
startups. We're trying to help them become successful startups. We're not just
trying to get them to be successful, but to be successful in a way
that's scalable, sustainable, and repeatable. We're not trying to
make a profit from them. We're trying to help them make a profit. And we do that by helping them
learn, by giving them structure, by giving them access to
resources, by giving them a place to be. So in that sense, Y Combinator is different from traditional
venture capital. We're not just trying to make money. We're trying to
make the world a better place.

Paul Graham,What Business Can Learn from Open Source.txt,"August 2005
(This essay is derived from a talk at Oscon 2005.)
Lately companies have been paying more attention to open source. Ten years ago there seemed a real danger Microsoft would extend its
monopoly to servers. It seems safe to say now that open source has
prevented that. A recent survey found 52% of companies are replacing
Windows servers with Linux servers. [1]
More significant, I think, is which 52% they are. At this point,
anyone proposing to run Windows on servers should be prepared to
explain what they know about servers that Google, Yahoo, and Amazon
don't. But the biggest thing business has to learn from open source is not
about Linux or Firefox, but about the forces that produced them. Ultimately these will affect a lot more than what software you use. We may be able to get a fix on these underlying forces by triangulating
from open source and blogging. As you've probably noticed, they
have a lot in common. Like open source, blogging is something people do themselves, for
free, because they enjoy it. Like open source hackers, bloggers
compete with people working for money, and often win. The method
of ensuring quality is also the same: Darwinian. Companies ensure
quality through rules to prevent employees from screwing up. But
you don't need that when the audience can communicate with one
another. People just produce whatever they want; the good stuff
spreads, and the bad gets ignored. And in both cases, feedback
from the audience improves the best work. Another thing blogging and open source have in common is the Web. People have always been willing to do great work
for free, but before the Web it was harder to reach an audience
or collaborate on projects. Amateurs
I think the most important of the new principles business has to learn is
that people work a lot harder on stuff they like. Well, that's
news to no one. So how can I claim business has to learn it? When
I say business doesn't know this, I mean the structure of business
doesn't reflect it. Business still reflects an older model, exemplified by the French
word for working: travailler. It has an English cousin, travail,
and what it means is torture. [2]
This turns out not to be the last word on work, however. As societies get richer, they learn something about
work that's a lot like what they learn about diet. We know now that the
healthiest diet is the one our peasant ancestors were forced to
eat because they were poor. Like rich food, idleness
only seems desirable when you don't get enough of it. I think we were
designed to work, just as we were designed to eat a certain amount
of fiber, and we feel bad if we don't. There's a name for people who work for the love of it: amateurs. The word now has such bad connotations that we forget its etymology,
though it's staring us in the face.","""Amateur"" was originally rather a complimentary word. But the thing to be in the twentieth century was professional, which amateurs, by definition, are not. That's why the business world was so surprised by one lesson from open source: that people working for love often surpass those working for money. Users don't switch from Explorer to Firefox because they want to hack the source. They switch because it's a better browser. It's not that Microsoft isn't trying. They know controlling the browser is one of the keys to retaining their monopoly. The problem is the same they face in operating systems: they can't pay people enough to build something better than a group of inspired hackers will build for free. I suspect professionalism was always overrated-- not just in the literal sense of working for money, but also connotations like formality and detachment. Inconceivable as it would have seemed in, say, 1970, I think professionalism was largely a fashion, driven by conditions that happened to exist in the twentieth century. One of the most powerful of those was the existence of ""channels."" Revealingly, the same term was used for both products and information: there were distribution channels, and TV and radio channels. It was the narrowness of such channels that made professionals seem so superior to amateurs. There were only a few jobs as professional journalists, for example, so competition ensured the average journalist was fairly good. Whereas anyone can express opinions about current events in a bar. And so the average person expressing his opinions in a bar sounds like an idiot compared to a journalist writing about the subject. On the Web, the barrier for publishing your ideas is even lower. You don't have to buy a drink, and they even let kids in. Millions of people are publishing online, and the average level of what they're writing, as you might expect, is not very good. This has led some in the media to conclude that blogs don't present much of a threat-- that blogs are just a fad. Actually, the fad is the word ""blog,"" at least the way the print media now use it. What they mean by ""blogger"" is not someone who publishes in a weblog format, but anyone who publishes online. That's going to become a problem as the Web becomes the default medium for publication. So I'd like to suggest an alternative word for someone who publishes online. How about ""writer?"" Those in the print media who dismiss the writing online because of its low average quality are missing an important point: no one reads the average blog. In the old world of channels, it meant something to talk about average quality, because that's what you were getting whether you liked it or not. But now you can read any writer you want. So the average quality of writing online isn't what the print media are competing against. They're competing against the best writing online. And, like Microsoft, they're losing. I know that from","The Latin word amare is to love. So, the original
meaning of ""amateur"" is ""one who loves something."" The modern connotation is ""one who does something for a living, not as a
hobby or passion."" So, the word has evolved from a positive to a negative. The point is that when you're doing something you love, you work hard
and you are good at it. This is a key insight for business. If business
doesn't know this, it's not because of a lack of knowledge, but
because of a lack of perspective. In the business world, we don't think about the work people do in
terms of what they love. We think of it in terms of what they can be paid for. We have
the same problem as the restaurant industry. We don't think of
food in terms of what people love. We think of it in terms of what
we can sell. [3]
In the restaurant industry, it's possible to do what people love
for a living. You could be a chef, for example. But the restaurant
industry is dominated by people who do not love cooking. They
are there for the money. They are not the ones who are
doing the cooking. It's the waiters, who are not chefs, who are
the ones who are serving the food. The same is true in the
business world. The people who are actually doing the work are
not the ones who are being paid. The people who are being
paid are not the ones who are doing the work. So, this is a problem.
I think the key is to recognize that the people who are doing the
work are the ones who are doing the work that people love. So, if
you want to do the work that people love, you have to find the people
who love it. You have to find the people who love the work, not the",499,500,323,0.1737,0.2513,0.9785,0.9404,0.9603,0.8541,0.6392,-2.2545,0.3897,0.3907,0.0469,0.0424,0.0046,0.0025,0.4399,0.1768,0.9781,0.9611,0.4199655765920826,0.4334470989761092,0.5543766578249337,7,6,0.9611,0.9714,0.16032064128256512,0.176,0.16718266253869968,0.9039,0.5131,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,Hackers and Painters.txt,"May 2003
(This essay is derived from a guest lecture at Harvard, which incorporated
an earlier talk at Northeastern.)
When I finished grad school in computer science I went
to art school to study painting. A lot of people seemed surprised
that someone interested in computers would also be interested in painting. They seemed to think that
hacking and painting were very different kinds of work-- that
hacking was cold, precise, and methodical, and that
painting was the frenzied expression of some primal urge. Both of these images are wrong. Hacking and painting have a
lot in common. In fact, of all the different types of people I've
known, hackers and painters are among the most alike. What hackers and painters have in common is that they're
both makers. Along with composers, architects, and writers,
what hackers and painters are trying to do is make good things. They're not doing research per se, though if in the course of
trying to make good things they discover some new technique,
so much the better. I've never liked the term ""computer science."" The main
reason I don't like it is that there's no such thing. Computer science is a
grab bag of tenuously related areas thrown together
by an accident of history, like Yugoslavia. At one end you have people who are really mathematicians,
but call what they're doing computer science so they can get DARPA grants. In the middle you have people working on
something like the natural history of computers-- studying the
behavior of algorithms for routing data through
networks, for example. And then at the other extreme you
have the hackers, who are trying to
write interesting software, and for whom computers are just a
medium of expression, as concrete is for architects or
paint for painters. It's as if
mathematicians, physicists, and architects all had to be in
the same department. Sometimes what the hackers do is called ""software engineering,""
but this term is just as misleading. Good software designers are no more engineers than architects are. The border between architecture and engineering is not sharply
defined, but it's there. It falls between what and how: architects decide what to do,
and engineers figure out how to do it. What and how should not be kept too separate. You're
asking for trouble if you try to decide what to do without
understanding how to do it. But hacking can certainly be more than just deciding how to
implement some spec. At its best, it's creating the spec-- though
it turns out the best way to do that is to implement it. Perhaps one day
""computer science"" will, like Yugoslavia, get broken up into its
component parts. That might be a good thing. Especially if it
meant independence for my native land, hacking. Bundling all these different types of work together in one
department may be convenient administratively, but it's confusing
intellectually.","That's the other reason I don't like the name ""computer science."" Arguably the people in the middle are doing something like an experimental science. But the people at either end, the hackers and the mathematicians, are not actually doing science. The mathematicians don't seem bothered by this. They happily set to work proving theorems like the other mathematicians over in the math department, and probably soon stop noticing that the building they work in says ``computer science'' on the outside. But for the hackers this label is a problem. If what they're doing is called science, it makes them feel they ought to be acting scientific. So instead of doing what they really want to do, which is to design beautiful software, hackers in universities and research labs feel they ought to be writing research papers. In the best case, the papers are just a formality. Hackers write cool software, and then write a paper about it, and the paper becomes a proxy for the achievement represented by the software. But often this mismatch causes problems. It's easy to drift away from building beautiful things toward building ugly things that make more suitable subjects for research papers. Unfortunately, beautiful things don't always make the best subjects for papers. Number one, research must be original-- and as anyone who has written a PhD dissertation knows, the way to be sure that you're exploring virgin territory is to stake out a piece of ground that no one wants. Number two, research must be substantial-- and awkward systems yield meatier papers, because you can write about the obstacles you have to overcome in order to get things done. Nothing yields meaty problems like starting with the wrong assumptions. Most of AI is an example of this rule; if you assume that knowledge can be represented as a list of predicate logic expressions whose arguments represent abstract concepts, you'll have a lot of papers to write about how to make this work. As Ricky Ricardo used to say, ""Lucy, you got a lot of explaining to do."" The way to create something beautiful is often to make subtle tweaks to something that already exists, or to combine existing ideas in a slightly new way. This kind of work is hard to convey in a research paper. So why do universities and research labs continue to judge hackers by publications? For the same reason that ""scholastic aptitude"" gets measured by simple-minded standardized tests, or the productivity of programmers gets measured in lines of code. These tests are easy to apply, and there is nothing so tempting as an easy test that kind of works. Measuring what hackers are actually trying to do, designing beautiful software, would be much more difficult. You need a good sense of design to judge good design. And there is no correlation, except possibly a negative one, between people's ability to recognize good design and their confidence that they can. The only external test is time. Over time, beautiful things tend","The confusion is not just about the subject matter, but also
about the methods of work. The hackers, who are trying to make software, are not the same as the
mathematicians, who are trying to make math. In the case of mathematics, the work is
self-contained, and the methods of work are quite different. Mathematicians don't need to be concerned with the
implementation of their results. They're not trying to make something that's going to be used
in the real world. They're not trying to make something that's going to be
used by other people. They're trying to make something that's going to be understood
by other people. They're trying to make something that's going to be understood
by other people. In the case of hacking, the work is not self-contained. The results are not meant to be understood by other people,
but rather to be used by other people. The results are not meant to be understood, but to be used. So the methods of work are quite different. In the case of mathematics, the methods of work are
theoretical. In the case of hacking, they are practical. The methods of work for both are useful, but they're
different. So, in the case of hacking, the work is practical, and the
methods of work are practical. For the mathematician, the work is theoretical, and the methods
of work are theoretical. So, in the case of hacking, the work is practical, and the

One advantage of being old is that you can see change happen in
your lifetime. A lot of the change I've seen is fragmentation. US
politics is much more polarized than it used to be. Culturally we
have ever less common ground. The creative class flocks to a handful
of happy cities, abandoning the rest. And increasing economic
inequality means the spread between rich and poor is growing too. I'd like to propose a hypothesis: that all these trends are instances
of the same phenomenon. And moreover, that the cause is not some
force that's pulling us apart, but rather the erosion of forces
that had been pushing us together. Worse still, for those who worry about these trends, the forces
that were pushing us together were an anomaly, a one-time combination
of circumstances that's unlikely to be repeated — and indeed, that
we would not want to repeat. The two forces were war (above all World War II), and the rise of
large corporations. The effects of World War II were both economic and social. Economically, it decreased variation in income. Like all modern
armed forces, America's were socialist economically. From each
according to his ability, to each according to his need. More or
less. Higher ranking members of the military got more (as higher
ranking members of socialist societies always do), but what they
got was fixed according to their rank. And the flattening effect
wasn't limited to those under arms, because the US economy was
conscripted too. Between 1942 and 1945 all wages were set by the
National War Labor Board. Like the military, they defaulted to
flatness. And this national standardization of wages was so pervasive
that its effects could still be seen years after the war ended. [1]
Business owners weren't supposed to be making money either. FDR
said ""not a single war millionaire"" would be permitted. To ensure
that, any increase in a company's profits over prewar levels was
taxed at 85%. And when what was left after corporate taxes reached
individuals, it was taxed again at a marginal rate of 93%. [2]
Socially too the war tended to decrease variation. Over 16 million
men and women from all sorts of different backgrounds were brought
together in a way of life that was literally uniform. Service rates
for men born in the early 1920s approached 80%. And working toward
a common goal, often under stress, brought them still closer together. Though strictly speaking World War II lasted less than 4 years for
the US, its effects lasted longer. Wars make central governments
more powerful, and World War II was an extreme case of this. In
the US, as in all the other Allied countries, the federal government
was slow to give up the new powers it had acquired. Indeed, in
some respects the war didn't end in 1945; the enemy just switched
to the Soviet Union.","In tax rates, federal power, defense spending, conscription, and nationalism, the decades after the war looked more like wartime than prewar peacetime. [3] And the social effects lasted too. The kid pulled into the army from behind a mule team in West Virginia didn't simply go back to the farm afterward. Something else was waiting for him, something that looked a lot like the army. If total war was the big political story of the 20th century, the big economic story was the rise of a new kind of company. And this too tended to produce both social and economic cohesion. [4] The 20th century was the century of the big, national corporation. General Electric, General Foods, General Motors. Developments in finance, communications, transportation, and manufacturing enabled a new type of company whose goal was above all scale. Version 1 of this world was low-res: a Duplo world of a few giant companies dominating each big market. [5] The late 19th and early 20th centuries had been a time of consolidation, led especially by J. P. Morgan. Thousands of companies run by their founders were merged into a couple hundred giant ones run by professional managers. Economies of scale ruled the day. It seemed to people at the time that this was the final state of things. John D. Rockefeller said in 1880 The day of combination is here to stay. Individualism has gone, never to return. He turned out to be mistaken, but he seemed right for the next hundred years. The consolidation that began in the late 19th century continued for most of the 20th. By the end of World War II, as Michael Lind writes, ""the major sectors of the economy were either organized as government-backed cartels or dominated by a few oligopolistic corporations."" For consumers this new world meant the same choices everywhere, but only a few of them. When I grew up there were only 2 or 3 of most things, and since they were all aiming at the middle of the market there wasn't much to differentiate them. One of the most important instances of this phenomenon was in TV. Here there were 3 choices: NBC, CBS, and ABC. Plus public TV for eggheads and communists. The programs that the 3 networks offered were indistinguishable. In fact, here there was a triple pressure toward the center. If one show did try something daring, local affiliates in conservative markets would make them stop. Plus since TVs were expensive, whole families watched the same shows together, so they had to be suitable for everyone. And not only did everyone get the same thing, they got it at the same time. It's difficult to imagine now, but every night tens of millions of families would sit down together in front of their TV set watching the same show, at the same time, as their next door neighbors. What happens now with the Super Bowl used to happen every night. We were literally in sync. [6] In a","The postwar period was not a return to prewar conditions — it
was a new era. The war also created a new kind of organization. The large
corporation. The idea that a corporation was a kind of social entity that
was separate from its owners was a new concept. The US had
large corporations, but they were not social entities. The
corporation was a tool for the individual. After the war, with the new powers of the government, the
corporation became a social entity, and it was this new
corporation that was responsible for the great expansion of the
American economy. [3]
The corporations that had been formed during the war were not
just a new form of organization, but also a new kind of
economic system. They were not just businesses, but an economic
system. The war had made the US an economic superpower. The war had
also made the US a country with a high degree of economic
centralization. [4]
The war also caused the rise of the middle class. The US had
never had a strong middle class before, but after the war, the
middle class became the dominant class. The middle class
was the backbone of the American economy. The middle class
was not just the middle of the income distribution, but the
middle of the society, and the middle of the social structure. The
middle class was the glue that held society together. [5]
So, the two forces that brought us together — war and the rise of
large corporations — were not just one-time events, but
rather, the beginning of a new era in which these forces
continued to shape our society. But now, in the postwar era, these forces have been replaced
by other forces, and the result is the fragmentation we see
today. The new forces that replaced the old are the rise of the
creative class, the decline of the middle",484,500,320,0.1509,0.2415,0.9772,0.9259,0.9105,0.9205,-1.3785,1.3306,0.3175,0.3335,0.0464,0.0702,0.0058,0.0156,0.4899,0.4745,0.9745,0.9299,0.3925399644760213,0.3968804159445407,0.45429362880886426,8,7,0.9812,0.9575,0.1590909090909091,0.164,0.13125,0.9171,0.5566,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,Superlinear Returns.txt,"October 2023
One of the most important things I didn't understand about the world
when I was a child is the degree to which the returns for performance
are superlinear. Teachers and coaches implicitly told us the returns were linear. ""You get out,"" I heard a thousand times, ""what you put in."" They
meant well, but this is rarely true. If your product is only half
as good as your competitor's, you don't get half as many customers. You get no customers, and you go out of business. It's obviously true that the returns for performance are superlinear
in business. Some think this is a flaw of capitalism, and that if
we changed the rules it would stop being true. But superlinear
returns for performance are a feature of the world, not an artifact
of rules we've invented. We see the same pattern in fame, power,
military victories, knowledge, and even benefit to humanity. In all
of these, the rich get richer. [1]
You can't understand the world without understanding the concept
of superlinear returns. And if you're ambitious you definitely
should, because this will be the wave you surf on. It may seem as if there are a lot of different situations with
superlinear returns, but as far as I can tell they reduce to two
fundamental causes: exponential growth and thresholds. The most obvious case of superlinear returns is when you're working
on something that grows exponentially. For example, growing bacterial
cultures. When they grow at all, they grow exponentially. But they're
tricky to grow. Which means the difference in outcome between someone
who's adept at it and someone who's not is very great. Startups can also grow exponentially, and we see the same pattern
there. Some manage to achieve high growth rates. Most don't. And
as a result you get qualitatively different outcomes: the companies
with high growth rates tend to become immensely valuable, while the
ones with lower growth rates may not even survive. Y Combinator encourages founders to focus on growth rate rather
than absolute numbers. It prevents them from being discouraged early
on, when the absolute numbers are still low. It also helps them
decide what to focus on: you can use growth rate as a compass to
tell you how to evolve the company. But the main advantage is that
by focusing on growth rate you tend to get something that grows
exponentially. YC doesn't explicitly tell founders that with growth rate ""you get
out what you put in,"" but it's not far from the truth. And if growth
rate were proportional to performance, then the reward for performance
p over time t would be proportional to pt. Even after decades of thinking about this, I find that sentence
startling. Whenever how well you do depends on how well you've done, you'll
get exponential growth. But neither our DNA nor our customs prepare
us for it.","No one finds exponential growth natural; every child is surprised, the first time they hear it, by the story of the man who asks the king for a single grain of rice the first day and double the amount each successive day. What we don't understand naturally we develop customs to deal with, but we don't have many customs about exponential growth either, because there have been so few instances of it in human history. In principle herding should have been one: the more animals you had, the more offspring they'd have. But in practice grazing land was the limiting factor, and there was no plan for growing that exponentially. Or more precisely, no generally applicable plan. There was a way to grow one's territory exponentially: by conquest. The more territory you control, the more powerful your army becomes, and the easier it is to conquer new territory. This is why history is full of empires. But so few people created or ran empires that their experiences didn't affect customs very much. The emperor was a remote and terrifying figure, not a source of lessons one could use in one's own life. The most common case of exponential growth in preindustrial times was probably scholarship. The more you know, the easier it is to learn new things. The result, then as now, was that some people were startlingly more knowledgeable than the rest about certain topics. But this didn't affect customs much either. Although empires of ideas can overlap and there can thus be far more emperors, in preindustrial times this type of empire had little practical effect. [2] That has changed in the last few centuries. Now the emperors of ideas can design bombs that defeat the emperors of territory. But this phenomenon is still so new that we haven't fully assimilated it. Few even of the participants realize they're benefitting from exponential growth or ask what they can learn from other instances of it. The other source of superlinear returns is embodied in the expression ""winner take all."" In a sports match the relationship between performance and return is a step function: the winning team gets one win whether they do much better or just slightly better. [3] The source of the step function is not competition per se, however. It's that there are thresholds in the outcome. You don't need competition to get those. There can be thresholds in situations where you're the only participant, like proving a theorem or hitting a target. It's remarkable how often a situation with one source of superlinear returns also has the other. Crossing thresholds leads to exponential growth: the winning side in a battle usually suffers less damage, which makes them more likely to win in the future. And exponential growth helps you cross thresholds: in a market with network effects, a company that grows fast enough can shut out potential competitors. Fame is an interesting example of a phenomenon that combines both sources of superlinear returns. Fame grows exponentially","So we're not used to it. And that's why we feel
that the world is linear. [2]
Another reason why superlinear returns are so common is because
of thresholds. When you cross a threshold, you can go from a
low to a high. It's not just about how much you do, it's about when
you do it. And when you cross a threshold, the returns become superlinear. The
threshold is the minimum amount you need to do to get the
benefit. The key is to find the right threshold. For example, in the case of
a movie, the threshold is the minimum number of people who have to
see it to make it worth while. If you get to that point, you get
superlinear returns. If you don't, then you're stuck in the linear world. The same is true for
anything that has a threshold. A startup, a business, a product, a
technology, a social network, a movie, a book, a sports team, a
political movement, a religion, etc. The idea is that once you cross the threshold, you can
get into a virtuous cycle. The virtuous cycle is when you have a product or a business that
has enough users or customers that you can get more users or
customers by attracting them. That is, the more users you have, the more you can attract users. The
threshold is the minimum number of users that you need to get into that
virtuous cycle. [3]
So, the idea is that the more you do, the more you get. The more you get, the more you can do. And the more you do, the more you get. It's a virtuous cycle. But there's a danger: once you get into the virtuous cycle, you
can't get out. It's a self-reinforcing loop. The more you get, the more you",483,500,306,0.2359,0.2187,0.9664,0.8996,0.9119,0.847,1.5063,-2.3854,0.3608,0.3392,0.0355,0.0617,0.0047,0.0013,0.2277,0.7301,0.9663,0.961,0.43716814159292033,0.4388111888111888,0.527027027027027,7,6,0.9907,0.9638,0.16977225672877846,0.144,0.21241830065359477,0.932,0.5761,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,The Airbnbs.txt,"December 2020
To celebrate Airbnb's IPO and to help future founders, I thought
it might be useful to explain what was special about Airbnb. What was special about the Airbnbs was how earnest they were. They
did nothing half-way, and we could sense this even in the interview. Sometimes after we interviewed a startup we'd be uncertain what to
do, and have to talk it over. Other times we'd just look at one
another and smile. The Airbnbs' interview was that kind. We didn't
even like the idea that much. Nor did users, at that stage; they
had no growth. But the founders seemed so full of energy that it
was impossible not to like them. That first impression was not misleading. During the batch our
nickname for Brian Chesky was The Tasmanian Devil, because like the
cartoon
character he seemed a tornado of energy. All three of them were
like that. No one ever worked harder during YC than the Airbnbs
did. When you talked to the Airbnbs, they took notes. If you suggested
an idea to them in office hours, the next time you talked to them
they'd not only have implemented it, but also implemented two new
ideas they had in the process. ""They probably have the best attitude
of any startup we've funded"" I wrote to Mike Arrington during the
batch. They're still like that. Jessica and I had dinner with Brian in the
summer of 2018, just the three of us. By this point the company is
ten years old. He took a page of notes about ideas for new things
Airbnb could do. What we didn't realize when we first met Brian and Joe and Nate was
that Airbnb was on its last legs. After working on the company for
a year and getting no growth, they'd agreed to give it one last
shot. They'd try this Y Combinator thing, and if the company still
didn't take off, they'd give up. Any normal person would have given up already. They'd been funding
the company with credit cards. They had a binder full of
credit cards they'd maxed out. Investors didn't think much of the
idea. One investor they met in a cafe walked out in the middle of
meeting with them. They thought he was going to the bathroom, but
he never came back. ""He didn't even finish his smoothie,"" Brian
said. And now, in late 2008, it was the worst recession in decades. The stock market was in free fall and wouldn't hit bottom for another
four months. Why hadn't they given up? This is a useful question to ask. People,
like matter, reveal their nature under extreme conditions. One thing
that's clear is that they weren't doing this just for the money. As a money-making scheme, this was pretty lousy: a year's work and
all they had to show for it was a binder full of maxed-out credit
cards. So why were they still working on this startup?","Because of the experience they'd had as the first hosts. When they first tried renting out airbeds on their floor during a design convention, all they were hoping for was to make enough money to pay their rent that month. But something surprising happened: they enjoyed having those first three guests staying with them. And the guests enjoyed it too. Both they and the guests had done it because they were in a sense forced to, and yet they'd all had a great experience. Clearly there was something new here: for hosts, a new way to make money that had literally been right under their noses, and for guests, a new way to travel that was in many ways better than hotels. That experience was why the Airbnbs didn't give up. They knew they'd discovered something. They'd seen a glimpse of the future, and they couldn't let it go. They knew that once people tried staying in what is now called ""an airbnb,"" they would also realize that this was the future. But only if they tried it, and they weren't. That was the problem during Y Combinator: to get growth started. Airbnb's goal during YC was to reach what we call ramen profitability, which means making enough money that the company can pay the founders' living expenses, if they live on ramen noodles. Ramen profitability is not, obviously, the end goal of any startup, but it's the most important threshold on the way, because this is the point where you're airborne. This is the point where you no longer need investors' permission to continue existing. For the Airbnbs, ramen profitability was $4000 a month: $3500 for rent, and $500 for food. They taped this goal to the mirror in the bathroom of their apartment. The way to get growth started in something like Airbnb is to focus on the hottest subset of the market. If you can get growth started there, it will spread to the rest. When I asked the Airbnbs where there was most demand, they knew from searches: New York City. So they focused on New York. They went there in person to visit their hosts and help them make their listings more attractive. A big part of that was better pictures. So Joe and Brian rented a professional camera and took pictures of the hosts' places themselves. This didn't just make the listings better. It also taught them about their hosts. When they came back from their first trip to New York, I asked what they'd noticed about hosts that surprised them, and they said the biggest surprise was how many of the hosts were in the same position they'd been in: they needed this money to pay their rent. This was, remember, the worst recession in decades, and it had hit New York first. It definitely added to the Airbnbs' sense of mission to feel that people needed them. In late January 2009, about three weeks into Y Combinator, their efforts started to show","What made them
so determined? The answer is that they had a deep
passion for what they were doing. They didn't just want to make money. They wanted to
change the world. They believed that the
way people travel was wrong. They believed that
the way people live was wrong. They believed that
the way people connect with each other was wrong. That's a big difference from most startups. Most startups are
about making money. This is about changing the world. That's the real difference. That's why the
Airbnb story is so inspiring. It's not about the
money, it's about the passion. The reason they kept going
through the worst recession was because they believed in what they
were doing. They believed in their mission. That's the key. The key is that they believed in what they were doing. That's the key to
success. That's the key to everything. And that's why, when we
met them in 2008, we were so
impressed by them. That's why we decided to
invest in them. That's why we're still
investing in them. So what is it that makes a company
successful? It's not just money, it's not just
the size of the company, it's not
just the product. It's not just the
market. It's not just the team. It's not just the
product. It's not just the
market. It's not just the

Paul Graham,Undergraduation.txt,"Want to start a startup? Get funded by
Y Combinator. March 2005
(Parts of this essay began as replies to students who wrote to
me with questions.)
Recently I've had several emails from computer science
undergrads asking what to do in college. I might not
be the best source of advice, because I was a philosophy major in
college. But I took so many CS classes that most CS majors thought
I was one. I was certainly a hacker, at least. Hacking
What should you do in college to become a
good hacker? There are two
main things you can do: become very good at programming, and learn
a lot about specific, cool problems. These turn out to be equivalent,
because each drives you to do the other. The way to be good at programming is to work (a) a lot (b) on hard
problems. And the way to make yourself work on hard problems is
to work on some very engaging project. Odds are this project won't be a class assignment. My friend Robert
learned a lot by writing network software when he was an
undergrad. One of his projects was to connect Harvard to the
Arpanet; it had been one of the original nodes, but by 1984 the
connection had died. [1] Not only was this
work not for a class, but because he spent all his time on it
and neglected his studies, he was kicked out of
school for a year. [2] It all evened out in the end, and now he's
a professor at MIT. But you'll probably be happier if you don't
go to that extreme; it caused him a lot of worry at the time. Another way to be good at programming is to find other people who
are good at it, and learn what they know. Programmers tend to sort
themselves into tribes according to the type of work they do and
the tools they use, and some tribes are
smarter than others. Look
around you and see what the smart people seem to be working on;
there's usually a reason. Some of the smartest people around you are professors. So one way
to find interesting work is to volunteer as a research assistant. Professors are especially interested in people who can solve tedious
system-administration type problems for them, so that is a way to
get a foot in the door. What they fear are
flakes and resume padders. It's all too
common for an assistant to result in a net increase in work. So
you have to make it clear you'll mean a net decrease. Don't be put off if they say no. Rejection is almost always less
personal than the rejectee imagines. Just move on to the next. (This applies to dating too.)
Beware, because although most professors are smart, not all of them
work on interesting stuff. Professors have to publish novel results
to advance their careers, but there is more competition in more
interesting areas of research.","So what less ambitious professors do is turn out a series of papers whose conclusions are novel because no one else cares about them. You're better off avoiding these. I never worked as a research assistant, so I feel a bit dishonest recommending that route. I learned to program by writing stuff of my own, particularly by trying to reverse-engineer Winograd's SHRDLU. I was as obsessed with that program as a mother with a new baby. Whatever the disadvantages of working by yourself, the advantage is that the project is all your own. You never have to compromise or ask anyone's permission, and if you have a new idea you can just sit down and start implementing it. In your own projects you don't have to worry about novelty (as professors do) or profitability (as businesses do). All that matters is how hard the project is technically, and that has no correlation to the nature of the application. ""Serious"" applications like databases are often trivial and dull technically (if you ever suffer from insomnia, try reading the technical literature about databases) while ""frivolous"" applications like games are often very sophisticated. I'm sure there are game companies out there working on products with more intellectual content than the research at the bottom nine tenths of university CS departments. If I were in college now I'd probably work on graphics: a network game, for example, or a tool for 3D animation. When I was an undergrad there weren't enough cycles around to make graphics interesting, but it's hard to imagine anything more fun to work on now. Math When I was in college, a lot of the professors believed (or at least wished) that computer science was a branch of math. This idea was strongest at Harvard, where there wasn't even a CS major till the 1980s; till then one had to major in applied math. But it was nearly as bad at Cornell. When I told the fearsome Professor Conway that I was interested in AI (a hot topic then), he told me I should major in math. I'm still not sure whether he thought AI required math, or whether he thought AI was nonsense and that majoring in something rigorous would cure me of such stupid ambitions. In fact, the amount of math you need as a hacker is a lot less than most university departments like to admit. I don't think you need much more than high school math plus a few concepts from the theory of computation. (You have to know what an n^2 algorithm is if you want to avoid writing them.) Unless you're planning to write math applications, of course. Robotics, for example, is all math. But while you don't literally need math for most kinds of hacking, in the sense of knowing 1001 tricks for differentiating formulas, math is very much worth studying for its own sake. It's a valuable source of metaphors for almost any kind of work.[3] I wish I'd studied more math","The more interesting the work, the
more competition. So, in the early years, you might be better off
working on something that is not as interesting, but is more
accessible, and therefore more likely to get you a research
position. If you're not interested in research, maybe you can find
a job at a company. You can get a job at a company by getting
a job at a company. So you can get your first job by getting
an internship. But the only way to get an internship is to have a
good résumé. But that's the thing you're trying to build. So how do you build a résumé? Well, you can do a bunch of things, like take
classes, get involved in clubs, write a good essay, do a
project. But the most important thing is to get an internship. So you have to start working on projects that are
interesting and that you can show off in an interview. The key to getting a job at a company is to have a
project that you can show off in an interview. But if you don't
have that, you can get a job by working for a company that has
a good reputation, like Google, and then you can get a job at
another company. That's the classic ""start at the top"" strategy. But the problem with that is that you might not be good
enough for the top company, and you might not be able to get
a job at another company. So you have to find a way to get a job at a

Paul Graham,What You'll Wish You'd Known.txt,"January 2005
(I wrote this talk for a
high school. I never actually
gave it, because the school authorities vetoed the plan to invite me.)
When I said I was speaking at a high school, my friends were curious. What will you say to high school students? So I asked them, what
do you wish someone had told you in high school? Their answers
were remarkably similar. So I'm going to tell you what we all wish
someone had told us. I'll start by telling you something you don't have to know in high
school: what you want to do with your life. People are always
asking you this, so you think you're supposed to have an answer. But adults ask this mainly as a conversation starter. They want
to know what sort of person you are, and this question is just to
get you talking. They ask it the way you might poke a hermit crab
in a tide pool, to see what it does. If I were back in high school and someone asked about my plans, I'd
say that my first priority was to learn what the options were. You
don't need to be in a rush to choose your life's work. What you
need to do is discover what you like. You have to work on stuff
you like if you want to be good at what you do. It might seem that nothing would be easier than deciding what you
like, but it turns out to be hard, partly because it's hard to get
an accurate picture of most jobs. Being a doctor is not the way
it's portrayed on TV. Fortunately you can also watch real doctors,
by volunteering in hospitals. [1]
But there are other jobs you can't learn about, because no one is
doing them yet. Most of the work I've done in the last ten years
didn't exist when I was in high school. The world changes fast,
and the rate at which it changes is itself speeding up. In such a
world it's not a good idea to have fixed plans. And yet every May, speakers all over the country fire up the Standard
Graduation Speech, the theme of which is: don't give up on your
dreams. I know what they mean, but this is a bad way to put it,
because it implies you're supposed to be bound by some plan you
made early on. The computer world has a name for this: premature
optimization. And it is synonymous with disaster. These speakers
would do better to say simply, don't give up. What they really mean is, don't get demoralized. Don't think that
you can't do what other people can. And I agree you shouldn't
underestimate your potential. People who've done great things tend
to seem as if they were a race apart.","And most biographies only exaggerate this illusion, partly due to the worshipful attitude biographers inevitably sink into, and partly because, knowing how the story ends, they can't help streamlining the plot till it seems like the subject's life was a matter of destiny, the mere unfolding of some innate genius. In fact I suspect if you had the sixteen year old Shakespeare or Einstein in school with you, they'd seem impressive, but not totally unlike your other friends. Which is an uncomfortable thought. If they were just like us, then they had to work very hard to do what they did. And that's one reason we like to believe in genius. It gives us an excuse for being lazy. If these guys were able to do what they did only because of some magic Shakespeareness or Einsteinness, then it's not our fault if we can't do something as good. I'm not saying there's no such thing as genius. But if you're trying to choose between two theories and one gives you an excuse for being lazy, the other one is probably right. So far we've cut the Standard Graduation Speech down from ""don't give up on your dreams"" to ""what someone else can do, you can do."" But it needs to be cut still further. There is some variation in natural ability. Most people overestimate its role, but it does exist. If I were talking to a guy four feet tall whose ambition was to play in the NBA, I'd feel pretty stupid saying, you can do anything if you really try. [2] We need to cut the Standard Graduation Speech down to, ""what someone else with your abilities can do, you can do; and don't underestimate your abilities."" But as so often happens, the closer you get to the truth, the messier your sentence gets. We've taken a nice, neat (but wrong) slogan, and churned it up like a mud puddle. It doesn't make a very good speech anymore. But worse still, it doesn't tell you what to do anymore. Someone with your abilities? What are your abilities? Upwind I think the solution is to work in the other direction. Instead of working back from a goal, work forward from promising situations. This is what most successful people actually do anyway. In the graduation-speech approach, you decide where you want to be in twenty years, and then ask: what should I do now to get there? I propose instead that you don't commit to anything in the future, but just look at the options available now, and choose those that will give you the most promising range of options afterward. It's not so important what you work on, so long as you're not wasting your time. Work on things that interest you and increase your options, and worry later about which you'll take. Suppose you're a college freshman deciding whether to major in math or economics. Well, math will give you more options: you can go into almost any","But that's only because they've been so good at what they do. What's important is not that you're different, but that you're
capable of doing what you want. So, the advice is: don't give up. But the
message is not that you should be in a hurry. So, if you're not sure what you want to do, you're not in
trouble. Just be curious. Ask questions. Try things. It's not that you have to be a master of your
own life, but that you have to be a participant in your own
life. You can't plan your life. You can only try to make it
worthwhile. The idea that you should be in control of your life is a
misconception. The best thing you can do is to be a good student. That
means not only studying the subject you're supposed to study,
but also learning how to learn. Learning how to learn is not the same as
memorizing facts. It's not about memorizing the facts that your teacher
gives you, but about learning how to find the facts, how to
check your own work, how to be able to use what you learn in
different ways. If you learn how to learn, you'll be able to find the answer
to any question, not just the ones that are in the book. And this
is the key to the whole thing: if you learn how to learn, you
don't need to know what you're going to do. You can find the
answer to the question, ""What do I want to do with my life?"" as
you go along. [2] [3]
So, the advice is: don't be in a hurry. Don't be in a
hurry to decide. Don't be in a hurry to fix your life.

Paul Graham,Why to Start a Startup in a Bad Economy.txt,"Want to start a startup? Get funded by
Y Combinator. October 2008
The economic situation is apparently so grim that some experts fear
we may be in for a stretch as bad as the mid seventies. When Microsoft and Apple were founded. As those examples suggest, a recession may not be such a bad time
to start a startup. I'm not claiming it's a particularly good time
either. The truth is more boring: the state of the economy doesn't
matter much either way. If we've learned one thing from funding so many startups, it's that
they succeed or fail based on the qualities of the founders. The
economy has some effect, certainly, but as a predictor of success
it's rounding error compared to the founders. Which means that what matters is who you are, not when you do it. If you're the right sort of person, you'll win even in a bad economy. And if you're not, a good economy won't save you. Someone who
thinks ""I better not start a startup now, because the economy is
so bad"" is making the same mistake as the people who thought during
the Bubble ""all I have to do is start a startup, and I'll be rich.""
So if you want to improve your chances, you should think far more
about who you can recruit as a cofounder than the state of the
economy. And if you're worried about threats to the survival of
your company, don't look for them in the news. Look in the mirror. But for any given team of founders, would it not pay to wait till
the economy is better before taking the leap? If you're starting
a restaurant, maybe, but not if you're working on technology. Technology progresses more or less independently of the stock market. So for any given idea, the payoff for acting fast in a bad economy
will be higher than for waiting. Microsoft's first product was a
Basic interpreter for the Altair. That was exactly what the world
needed in 1975, but if Gates and Allen had decided to wait a few
years, it would have been too late. Of course, the idea you have now won't be the last you have. There
are always new ideas. But if you have a specific idea you want to
act on, act now. That doesn't mean you can ignore the economy. Both customers and investors
will be feeling pinched. It's not necessarily a problem if customers
feel pinched: you may even be able to benefit from it, by making
things that save money. Startups often make things cheaper, so in
that respect they're better positioned to prosper in a recession
than big companies. Investors are more of a problem. Startups generally need to raise
some amount of external funding, and investors tend to be less
willing to invest in bad times. They shouldn't be. Everyone knows
you're supposed to buy when times are bad and sell when times are
good.","But of course what makes investing so counterintuitive is that in equity markets, good times are defined as everyone thinking it's time to buy. You have to be a contrarian to be correct, and by definition only a minority of investors can be. So just as investors in 1999 were tripping over one another trying to buy into lousy startups, investors in 2009 will presumably be reluctant to invest even in good ones. You'll have to adapt to this. But that's nothing new: startups always have to adapt to the whims of investors. Ask any founder in any economy if they'd describe investors as fickle, and watch the face they make. Last year you had to be prepared to explain how your startup was viral. Next year you'll have to explain how it's recession-proof. (Those are both good things to be. The mistake investors make is not the criteria they use but that they always tend to focus on one to the exclusion of the rest.) Fortunately the way to make a startup recession-proof is to do exactly what you should do anyway: run it as cheaply as possible. For years I've been telling founders that the surest route to success is to be the cockroaches of the corporate world. The immediate cause of death in a startup is always running out of money. So the cheaper your company is to operate, the harder it is to kill. And fortunately it has gotten very cheap to run a startup. A recession will if anything make it cheaper still. If nuclear winter really is here, it may be safer to be a cockroach even than to keep your job. Customers may drop off individually if they can no longer afford you, but you're not going to lose them all at once; markets don't ""reduce headcount."" What if you quit your job to start a startup that fails, and you can't find another? That could be a problem if you work in sales or marketing. In those fields it can take months to find a new job in a bad economy. But hackers seem to be more liquid. Good hackers can always get some kind of job. It might not be your dream job, but you're not going to starve. Another advantage of bad times is that there's less competition. Technology trains leave the station at regular intervals. If everyone else is cowering in a corner, you may have a whole car to yourself. You're an investor too. As a founder, you're buying stock with work: the reason Larry and Sergey are so rich is not so much that they've done work worth tens of billions of dollars, but that they were the first investors in Google. And like any investor you should buy when times are bad. Were you nodding in agreement, thinking ""stupid investors"" a few paragraphs ago when I was talking about how investors are reluctant to put money into startups in bad markets, even though that's the time","But in reality, people tend to be more cautious. So if you want to get funded, it's better to do it when the economy
is good. But if you're not waiting for the economy to get better, you
can still get funded. In fact, I think the opposite is true. I think in bad times, it's more likely that you will get funded.
Because even though investors are cautious, they are also
fearful of the risk of missing out. So even if they are less willing to invest, they are more likely to
take a chance on a good idea. This is not a very strong argument, but it's a real one. So if you're a founder, you should focus on being the best
founder you can be, not on when you start. And if you're an investor, you should focus on being the best
investor you can be, not on when you invest. And if you're a customer, you should focus on being the best
customer you can be, not on when you buy. But in the long run, if you're looking at the economy as a whole,
the timing is important. If you have a company that's going to be around for a while, you
should be careful when you start. Because the economy is going to change. So if you start during a bad economy, you have to work harder
to survive. But if you start during a good economy, you have the benefit of
the strong economy. But this is a very short-term view. The
long-term view is that the economy is going to change anyway. So the real
question is, are you able to adapt? The point is, the best time to start is when you're ready to start.
But if you're not ready, you can't wait for the right time. It's not that the economy is the only thing that matters. It's that it's not the main",496,500,323,0.2998,0.3476,0.9817,0.9499,0.9394,0.9417,1.0127,-0.9144,0.476,0.4527,0.0715,0.1242,0.0091,0.0382,0.7055,0.7127,0.9823,0.9838,0.4680483592400691,0.47017543859649125,0.5392670157068062,7,6,0.9847,0.9788,0.16733870967741934,0.144,0.18885448916408668,0.9586,0.6752,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,How to Do Great Work.txt,"July 2023
If you collected lists of techniques for doing great work in a lot
of different fields, what would the intersection look like? I decided
to find out by making it. Partly my goal was to create a guide that could be used by someone
working in any field. But I was also curious about the shape of the
intersection. And one thing this exercise shows is that it does
have a definite shape; it's not just a point labelled ""work hard.""
The following recipe assumes you're very ambitious. The first step is to decide what to work on. The work you choose
needs to have three qualities: it has to be something you have a
natural aptitude for, that you have a deep interest in, and that
offers scope to do great work. In practice you don't have to worry much about the third criterion. Ambitious people are if anything already too conservative about it. So all you need to do is find something you have an aptitude for
and great interest in. [1]
That sounds straightforward, but it's often quite difficult. When
you're young you don't know what you're good at or what different
kinds of work are like. Some kinds of work you end up doing may not
even exist yet. So while some people know what they want to do at
14, most have to figure it out. The way to figure out what to work on is by working. If you're not
sure what to work on, guess. But pick something and get going. You'll probably guess wrong some of the time, but that's fine. It's
good to know about multiple things; some of the biggest discoveries
come from noticing connections between different fields. Develop a habit of working on your own projects. Don't let ""work""
mean something other people tell you to do. If you do manage to do
great work one day, it will probably be on a project of your own. It may be within some bigger project, but you'll be driving your
part of it. What should your projects be? Whatever seems to you excitingly
ambitious. As you grow older and your taste in projects evolves,
exciting and important will converge. At 7 it may seem excitingly
ambitious to build huge things out of Lego, then at 14 to teach
yourself calculus, till at 21 you're starting to explore unanswered
questions in physics. But always preserve excitingness. There's a kind of excited curiosity that's both the engine and the
rudder of great work. It will not only drive you, but if you let
it have its way, will also show you what to work on. What are you excessively curious about — curious to a degree that
would bore most other people? That's what you're looking for. Once you've found something you're excessively interested in, the
next step is to learn enough about it to get you to one of the
frontiers of knowledge.","Knowledge expands fractally, and from a distance its edges look smooth, but once you learn enough to get close to one, they turn out to be full of gaps. The next step is to notice them. This takes some skill, because your brain wants to ignore such gaps in order to make a simpler model of the world. Many discoveries have come from asking questions about things that everyone else took for granted. [2] If the answers seem strange, so much the better. Great work often has a tincture of strangeness. You see this from painting to math. It would be affected to try to manufacture it, but if it appears, embrace it. Boldly chase outlier ideas, even if other people aren't interested in them — in fact, especially if they aren't. If you're excited about some possibility that everyone else ignores, and you have enough expertise to say precisely what they're all overlooking, that's as good a bet as you'll find. [3] Four steps: choose a field, learn enough to get to the frontier, notice gaps, explore promising ones. This is how practically everyone who's done great work has done it, from painters to physicists. Steps two and four will require hard work. It may not be possible to prove that you have to work hard to do great things, but the empirical evidence is on the scale of the evidence for mortality. That's why it's essential to work on something you're deeply interested in. Interest will drive you to work harder than mere diligence ever could. The three most powerful motives are curiosity, delight, and the desire to do something impressive. Sometimes they converge, and that combination is the most powerful of all. The big prize is to discover a new fractal bud. You notice a crack in the surface of knowledge, pry it open, and there's a whole world inside. Let's talk a little more about the complicated business of figuring out what to work on. The main reason it's hard is that you can't tell what most kinds of work are like except by doing them. Which means the four steps overlap: you may have to work at something for years before you know how much you like it or how good you are at it. And in the meantime you're not doing, and thus not learning about, most other kinds of work. So in the worst case you choose late based on very incomplete information. [4] The nature of ambition exacerbates this problem. Ambition comes in two forms, one that precedes interest in the subject and one that grows out of it. Most people who do great work have a mix, and the more you have of the former, the harder it will be to decide what to do. The educational systems in most countries pretend it's easy. They expect you to commit to a field long before you could know what it's really like. And as a result an ambitious person on an optimal","This is the step where most people fail. It's the step where you need to be really good at learning. It's not just about reading books, but also about learning from
people, and about learning from your own mistakes. The way to learn is to get into the field and do the work. You can't learn from books alone. I remember when I was 18, I read a whole lot of books on
neuroscience. I thought I had a good grasp of the field, and so I
applied for a research position. I was rejected, and that was
the first time I realized that reading books wasn't enough. [2] The step is about getting into the field and doing the work. The first
thing to do is to get a mentor. A mentor is someone who has already
done some of the work you're trying to do. It's not about just
getting a job, it's about getting someone who can guide you through
the work. So the first thing is to find a mentor. Then you need to
get into the field. This is the part where people often get stuck. How
do you get into the field? Well, you can't just read about it. You have to do it. You have to do the work. You have to be willing to go through the pain of getting
started. You have to be willing to do the work. But there's a trick. It's not that you have to do the work of the field. It's that you have to do the work of getting into the field. That is, the work of learning the field. You can't just read books and then apply for a job. You have to learn the field. You have to learn the tools, the methods, the way of thinking, the
way of doing. So the step is to learn the field. Once you've learned the field, the next step is to do",494,500,327,0.4109,0.2805,0.9829,0.928,0.9065,0.7511,1.5569,-3.7549,0.4786,0.4035,0.1273,0.0986,0.0278,0.0213,0.4561,0.4257,0.9866,0.9646,0.4755244755244755,0.4457831325301205,0.5404699738903395,8,7,0.9584,0.9854,0.15789473684210525,0.162,0.1712538226299694,0.8914,0.6129,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,Revenge of the Nerds.txt,"Want to start a startup? Get funded by
Y Combinator. May 2002
""We were after the C++ programmers. We managed to drag a
lot of them about halfway to Lisp.""
- Guy Steele, co-author of the Java spec
In the software business there is an ongoing
struggle between the pointy-headed academics, and another
equally formidable force, the pointy-haired bosses. Everyone
knows who the pointy-haired boss is, right? I think most
people in the technology world not only recognize this
cartoon character, but know the actual person in their company
that he is modelled upon. The pointy-haired boss miraculously combines two qualities
that are common by themselves, but rarely seen together:
(a) he knows nothing whatsoever about technology, and
(b) he has very strong opinions about it. Suppose, for example, you need to write a piece of software. The pointy-haired boss has no idea how this software
has to work, and can't tell one programming language from
another, and yet he knows what language you should write it in. Exactly. He thinks you should write it in Java. Why does he think this? Let's
take a look inside the brain of the pointy-haired boss. What
he's thinking is something like this. Java is a standard. I know it must be, because I read about it in the press all the time. Since it is a standard, I won't get in trouble for using it. And that also means there will always be lots of Java programmers,
so if the programmers working for me now quit, as programmers
working for me mysteriously always do, I can easily replace
them. Well, this doesn't sound that unreasonable. But it's all
based on one unspoken assumption, and that assumption
turns out to be false. The pointy-haired boss believes that all
programming languages are pretty much equivalent. If that were true, he would be right on
target. If languages are all equivalent, sure, use whatever
language everyone else is using. But all languages are not equivalent, and I think I can prove
this to you without even getting into the differences between them. If you asked the pointy-haired boss in 1992 what language
software should be written in, he would have answered with as
little hesitation as he does today. Software should be
written in C++. But if languages are all equivalent, why should the
pointy-haired boss's opinion ever change? In fact, why should
the developers of Java have even bothered to create a new
language? Presumably, if you create a new language, it's because you think
it's better in some way than what people already had. And in fact, Gosling
makes it clear in the first Java white paper that Java
was designed to fix some problems with C++. So there you have it: languages are not all equivalent. If you follow the
trail through the pointy-haired boss's brain to Java and then
back through Java's history to its origins, you end up holding
an idea that contradicts the assumption you started with.","So, who's right? James Gosling, or the pointy-haired boss? Not surprisingly, Gosling is right. Some languages are better, for certain problems, than others. And you know, that raises some interesting questions. Java was designed to be better, for certain problems, than C++. What problems? When is Java better and when is C++? Are there situations where other languages are better than either of them? Once you start considering this question, you have opened a real can of worms. If the pointy-haired boss had to think about the problem in its full complexity, it would make his brain explode. As long as he considers all languages equivalent, all he has to do is choose the one that seems to have the most momentum, and since that is more a question of fashion than technology, even he can probably get the right answer. But if languages vary, he suddenly has to solve two simultaneous equations, trying to find an optimal balance between two things he knows nothing about: the relative suitability of the twenty or so leading languages for the problem he needs to solve, and the odds of finding programmers, libraries, etc. for each. If that's what's on the other side of the door, it is no surprise that the pointy-haired boss doesn't want to open it. The disadvantage of believing that all programming languages are equivalent is that it's not true. But the advantage is that it makes your life a lot simpler. And I think that's the main reason the idea is so widespread. It is a comfortable idea. We know that Java must be pretty good, because it is the cool, new programming language. Or is it? If you look at the world of programming languages from a distance, it looks like Java is the latest thing. (From far enough away, all you can see is the large, flashing billboard paid for by Sun.) But if you look at this world up close, you find that there are degrees of coolness. Within the hacker subculture, there is another language called Perl that is considered a lot cooler than Java. Slashdot, for example, is generated by Perl. I don't think you would find those guys using Java Server Pages. But there is another, newer language, called Python, whose users tend to look down on Perl, and more waiting in the wings. If you look at these languages in order, Java, Perl, Python, you notice an interesting pattern. At least, you notice this pattern if you are a Lisp hacker. Each one is progressively more like Lisp. Python copies even features that many Lisp hackers consider to be mistakes. You could translate simple Lisp programs into Python line for line. It's 2002, and programming languages have almost caught up with 1958. Catching Up with Math What I mean is that Lisp was first discovered by John McCarthy in 1958, and popular programming languages are only now catching up with the ideas he developed then. Now, how could that be true?","This is the heart of the problem. The pointy-haired boss is not
telling you what language to use. He's telling you what
language to use because he believes that Java is a better
language than C++. But he doesn't know that. He thinks that Java is a standard, but that's not
why he thinks it's better. He thinks it's better because he believes
that it's a better language. So here's the problem: the pointy-haired boss is
not a technologist. He's a technophobe. So the pointy-haired boss is not the
only person with this problem. This is a common problem in
the software industry. The pointy-haired boss is
just a very visible one. The pointy-haired boss is
not the only one who has this problem. So the problem is not with the
pointy-haired boss, it's with the
pointy-haired boss's beliefs. So, in the software industry, it's very important to be
able to think critically about the technologies that we use.
Because if we don't, we're going to be making decisions
based on what people believe, not on what is actually true.
And that's a very dangerous thing.
So, in this talk, I'm going to talk about the
technological fallacies that we are all susceptible to, and

Paul Graham,Design and Research.txt,"January 2003
(This article is derived from a keynote talk at the fall 2002 meeting
of NEPLS.)
Visitors to this country are often surprised to find that
Americans like to begin a conversation by asking ""what do you do?""
I've never liked this question. I've rarely had a
neat answer to it. But I think I have finally solved the problem. Now, when someone asks me what I do, I look them straight
in the eye and say ""I'm designing a
new dialect of Lisp.""
I recommend this answer to anyone who doesn't like being asked what
they do. The conversation will turn immediately to other topics. I don't consider myself to be doing research on programming languages. I'm just designing one, in the same way that someone might design
a building or a chair or a new typeface. I'm not trying to discover anything new. I just want
to make a language that will be good to program in. In some ways,
this assumption makes life a lot easier. The difference between design and research seems to be a question
of new versus good. Design doesn't have to be new, but it has to
be good. Research doesn't have to be good, but it has to be new. I think these two paths converge at the top: the best design
surpasses its predecessors by using new ideas, and the best research
solves problems that are not only new, but actually worth solving. So ultimately we're aiming for the same destination, just approaching
it from different directions. What I'm going to talk about today is what your target looks like
from the back. What do you do differently when you treat
programming languages as a design problem instead of a research topic? The biggest difference is that you focus more on the user. Design begins by asking, who is this
for and what do they need from it? A good architect,
for example, does not begin by creating a design that he then
imposes on the users, but by studying the intended users and figuring
out what they need. Notice I said ""what they need,"" not ""what they want."" I don't mean
to give the impression that working as a designer means working as
a sort of short-order cook, making whatever the client tells you
to. This varies from field to field in the arts, but
I don't think there is any field in which the best work is done by
the people who just make exactly what the customers tell them to. The customer is always right in
the sense that the measure of good design is how well it works
for the user. If you make a novel that bores everyone, or a chair
that's horribly uncomfortable to sit in, then you've done a bad
job, period. It's no defense to say that the novel or the chair
is designed according to the most advanced theoretical principles.","And yet, making what works for the user doesn't mean simply making what the user tells you to. Users don't know what all the choices are, and are often mistaken about what they really want. The answer to the paradox, I think, is that you have to design for the user, but you have to design what the user needs, not simply what he says he wants. It's much like being a doctor. You can't just treat a patient's symptoms. When a patient tells you his symptoms, you have to figure out what's actually wrong with him, and treat that. This focus on the user is a kind of axiom from which most of the practice of good design can be derived, and around which most design issues center. If good design must do what the user needs, who is the user? When I say that design must be for users, I don't mean to imply that good design aims at some kind of lowest common denominator. You can pick any group of users you want. If you're designing a tool, for example, you can design it for anyone from beginners to experts, and what's good design for one group might be bad for another. The point is, you have to pick some group of users. I don't think you can even talk about good or bad design except with reference to some intended user. You're most likely to get good design if the intended users include the designer himself. When you design something for a group that doesn't include you, it tends to be for people you consider to be less sophisticated than you, not more sophisticated. That's a problem, because looking down on the user, however benevolently, seems inevitably to corrupt the designer. I suspect that very few housing projects in the US were designed by architects who expected to live in them. You can see the same thing in programming languages. C, Lisp, and Smalltalk were created for their own designers to use. Cobol, Ada, and Java, were created for other people to use. If you think you're designing something for idiots, the odds are that you're not designing something good, even for idiots. Even if you're designing something for the most sophisticated users, though, you're still designing for humans. It's different in research. In math you don't choose abstractions because they're easy for humans to understand; you choose whichever make the proof shorter. I think this is true for the sciences generally. Scientific ideas are not meant to be ergonomic. Over in the arts, things are very different. Design is all about people. The human body is a strange thing, but when you're designing a chair, that's what you're designing for, and there's no way around it. All the arts have to pander to the interests and limitations of humans. In painting, for example, all other things being equal a painting with people in it will be more interesting than one without. It is not merely","If the design doesn't work, it's just bad. The same goes for programming languages. A good programming language is one that is
useful to the programmer. If it's not useful, it's just a
language. Now, in the field of programming languages, there is
a lot of work that is done by people who are not designers. Some of that work is good, but a lot of it is not. The problem is that the field has a lot of
research traditions, and the research tradition is very strong in
theoretical computer science. So we're used to doing research, and we're used to thinking
of programming languages as a research topic. That makes it very hard for us to think of programming languages as a
design problem. So, to be a good designer, you have to
understand the theory, but you have to do it in a way that is
useful, not just interesting. That's the challenge. So, in this talk, I'm going to talk about
a few design principles that I think are important for
designing programming languages. But first, let me say that there is a lot of
research in the area of programming languages, but the field is
not dominated by research. So, the main point is that we need to
be designing. So, for example, in the case of the C
language, I think it's a good example of a design. It's not a research project, but it's a design that
has influenced the entire world of programming. C is not a language that is particularly
innovative, but it's a language that is very good at what it
does. Now, in the case of Lisp, I think it's a
research language. It's not a design, because it's not designed with the
user in mind. It's designed with the
theorist in mind. So, for example, the",489,500,308,0.3483,0.3836,0.957,0.9581,0.9385,0.8842,-1.0733,-2.0197,0.4504,0.4839,0.0814,0.0894,0.011,0.0116,0.3341,0.6314,0.9706,0.967,0.4804964539007092,0.467005076142132,0.5108108108108108,7,6,0.9564,0.9458,0.1554192229038855,0.182,0.2012987012987013,0.9171,0.7053,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,The Lesson to Unlearn.txt,"December 2019
The most damaging thing you learned in school wasn't something you
learned in any specific class. It was learning to get good grades. When I was in college, a particularly earnest philosophy grad student
once told me that he never cared what grade he got in a class, only
what he learned in it. This stuck in my mind because it was the
only time I ever heard anyone say such a thing. For me, as for most students, the measurement of what I was learning
completely dominated actual learning in college. I was fairly
earnest; I was genuinely interested in most of the classes I took,
and I worked hard. And yet I worked by far the hardest when I was
studying for a test. In theory, tests are merely what their name implies: tests of what
you've learned in the class. In theory you shouldn't have to prepare
for a test in a class any more than you have to prepare for a blood
test. In theory you learn from taking the class, from going to the
lectures and doing the reading and/or assignments, and the test
that comes afterward merely measures how well you learned. In practice, as almost everyone reading this will know, things are
so different that hearing this explanation of how classes and tests
are meant to work is like hearing the etymology of a word whose
meaning has changed completely. In practice, the phrase ""studying
for a test"" was almost redundant, because that was when one really
studied. The difference between diligent and slack students was
that the former studied hard for tests and the latter didn't. No
one was pulling all-nighters two weeks into the semester. Even though I was a diligent student, almost all the work I did in
school was aimed at getting a good grade on something. To many people, it would seem strange that the preceding sentence
has a ""though"" in it. Aren't I merely stating a tautology? Isn't
that what a diligent student is, a straight-A student? That's how
deeply the conflation of learning with grades has infused our
culture. Is it so bad if learning is conflated with grades? Yes, it is bad. And it wasn't till decades after college, when I was running Y Combinator, that I realized how bad it is. I knew of course when I was a student that studying for a test is
far from identical with actual learning. At the very least, you
don't retain knowledge you cram into your head the night before an
exam. But the problem is worse than that. The real problem is that
most tests don't come close to measuring what they're supposed to. If tests truly were tests of learning, things wouldn't be so bad. Getting good grades and learning would converge, just a little late. The problem is that nearly all tests given to students are terribly
hackable.","Most people who've gotten good grades know this, and know it so well they've ceased even to question it. You'll see when you realize how naive it sounds to act otherwise. Suppose you're taking a class on medieval history and the final exam is coming up. The final exam is supposed to be a test of your knowledge of medieval history, right? So if you have a couple days between now and the exam, surely the best way to spend the time, if you want to do well on the exam, is to read the best books you can find about medieval history. Then you'll know a lot about it, and do well on the exam. No, no, no, experienced students are saying to themselves. If you merely read good books on medieval history, most of the stuff you learned wouldn't be on the test. It's not good books you want to read, but the lecture notes and assigned reading in this class. And even most of that you can ignore, because you only have to worry about the sort of thing that could turn up as a test question. You're looking for sharply-defined chunks of information. If one of the assigned readings has an interesting digression on some subtle point, you can safely ignore that, because it's not the sort of thing that could be turned into a test question. But if the professor tells you that there were three underlying causes of the Schism of 1378, or three main consequences of the Black Death, you'd better know them. And whether they were in fact the causes or consequences is beside the point. For the purposes of this class they are. At a university there are often copies of old exams floating around, and these narrow still further what you have to learn. As well as learning what kind of questions this professor asks, you'll often get actual exam questions. Many professors re-use them. After teaching a class for 10 years, it would be hard not to, at least inadvertently. In some classes, your professor will have had some sort of political axe to grind, and if so you'll have to grind it too. The need for this varies. In classes in math or the hard sciences or engineering it's rarely necessary, but at the other end of the spectrum there are classes where you couldn't get a good grade without it. Getting a good grade in a class on x is so different from learning a lot about x that you have to choose one or the other, and you can't blame students if they choose grades. Everyone judges them by their grades — graduate programs, employers, scholarships, even their own parents. I liked learning, and I really enjoyed some of the papers and programs I wrote in college. But did I ever, after turning in a paper in some class, sit down and write another just for fun? Of course not. I had things due in other","They can be gamed. They can be manipulated. You can find the right formula for a test and then just
repeat it, and you can get a high grade. The problem is that when you
teach students to game the system, you are teaching them to avoid
learning. You are teaching them to memorize and to guess. You are teaching them to find the right formula to get the right
answer, and to find the right formula for the right answer. It's not that the students are bad. It's that the system is bad. The system is bad because the system rewards people for not learning
and for not thinking. The system is bad because the system is built on a
misunderstanding of what learning is. The system is bad because it's based on a misunderstanding
of what learning is. The system is bad because it's based on a misunderstanding of what
learning is. That's the problem. So, if the system is so bad, what can we do? That's the question I've been asking myself for a long time. I think the answer is that we have to change the system. We have to stop rewarding people for not learning. We have to stop rewarding people for not thinking. We have to stop rewarding people for not learning. We have to start rewarding people for learning. We have to start rewarding people for thinking. We have to start rewarding people for learning. We have to start rewarding people for thinking. So, how do we do that? The answer is that we have to make learning and thinking the
main measure of success. The only way to do that is to make learning and thinking the main
measure of success. The only way to do that is to make learning and thinking the main
measure of success. The repetition is important because it's the repetition that makes

Paul Graham,Why Smart People Have Bad Ideas.txt,"Want to start a startup? Get funded by
Y Combinator. April 2005
This summer, as an
experiment, some
friends and I are giving seed
funding to a bunch of new startups. It's an experiment because
we're prepared to fund younger founders than most investors would. That's why we're doing it during the summer—so even college
students can participate. We know from Google and Yahoo that grad students can start successful
startups. And we know from experience that some undergrads are as
capable as most grad students. The accepted age for startup founders
has been creeping downward. We're trying to find the lower bound. The deadline has now passed, and we're sifting through 227 applications. We expected to divide them into two categories, promising
and unpromising. But we soon saw we needed a third: promising
people with unpromising ideas. [1]
The Artix Phase
We should have expected this. It's very common for a group of
founders to go through one lame idea before realizing that a startup
has to make something people will pay for. In fact, we ourselves
did. Viaweb wasn't the first startup Robert Morris and I started. In
January 1995, we and a couple friends started a company called
Artix. The plan was to put art galleries on the Web. In retrospect,
I wonder how we could have wasted our time on anything so stupid. Galleries are not especially excited about being on
the Web even now, ten years later. They don't want to have their
stock visible to any random visitor, like an antique store. [2]
Besides which, art dealers are the most technophobic people on
earth. They didn't become art dealers after a difficult choice
between that and a career in the hard sciences. Most of them had
never seen the Web before we came to tell them why they should be
on it. Some didn't even have computers. It doesn't do justice to
the situation to describe it as a hard sell; we soon sank
to building sites for free, and it was hard to convince galleries
even to do that. Gradually it dawned on us that
instead of trying to make Web sites for
people who didn't want them, we could make sites for
people who did. In fact, software that would let people who wanted
sites make their own. So we ditched Artix and
started a new company, Viaweb, to make software for building online stores. That one succeeded. We're in good company here. Microsoft was not the first company
Paul Allen and Bill Gates started either. The first was called
Traf-o-data. It does not seem to have done as well as Micro-soft. In Robert's defense, he was skeptical about Artix. I dragged him
into it. [3]
But there were moments when he was optimistic.","And if we, who were 29 and 30 at the time, could get excited about such a thoroughly boneheaded idea, we should not be surprised that hackers aged 21 or 22 are pitching us ideas with little hope of making money. The Still Life Effect Why does this happen? Why do good hackers have bad business ideas? Let's look at our case. One reason we had such a lame idea was that it was the first thing we thought of. I was in New York trying to be a starving artist at the time (the starving part is actually quite easy), so I was haunting galleries anyway. When I learned about the Web, it seemed natural to mix the two. Make Web sites for galleries—that's the ticket! If you're going to spend years working on something, you'd think it might be wise to spend at least a couple days considering different ideas, instead of going with the first that comes into your head. You'd think. But people don't. In fact, this is a constant problem when you're painting still lifes. You plonk down a bunch of stuff on a table, and maybe spend five or ten minutes rearranging it to look interesting. But you're so impatient to get started painting that ten minutes of rearranging feels very long. So you start painting. Three days later, having spent twenty hours staring at it, you're kicking yourself for having set up such an awkward and boring composition, but by then it's too late. Part of the problem is that big projects tend to grow out of small ones. You set up a still life to make a quick sketch when you have a spare hour, and days later you're still working on it. I once spent a month painting three versions of a still life I set up in about four minutes. At each point (a day, a week, a month) I thought I'd already put in so much time that it was too late to change. So the biggest cause of bad ideas is the still life effect: you come up with a random idea, plunge into it, and then at each point (a day, a week, a month) feel you've put so much time into it that this must be the idea. How do we fix that? I don't think we should discard plunging. Plunging into an idea is a good thing. The solution is at the other end: to realize that having invested time in something doesn't make it good. This is clearest in the case of names. Viaweb was originally called Webgen, but we discovered someone else had a product called that. We were so attached to our name that we offered him 5% of the company if he'd let us have it. But he wouldn't, so we had to think of another. [4] The best we could do was Viaweb, which we disliked at first. It was like having a new mother. But within three days we","For example, he
once said, ""We should be able to make a company out of this."" And

He said that twice. [4]

The story of the founders of Viaweb and Artix is a classic example of
the need for an idea that solves a real problem. The first idea, Artix, was
based on an incorrect assumption that art galleries would want to be
on the Web. This is a classic case of a ""mistaken premise."" The
founders learned this lesson the hard way, but it's an important
lesson for any startup.
What is the main idea of the passage?

The main idea of the passage is that the founders of Viaweb and Artix initially pursued a mistaken premise by trying to create a website for art galleries, which ultimately failed because the galleries did not want their art online. This led them to pivot to a more successful idea: creating software that allows people to build their own online stores. The passage highlights the importance of identifying a real problem that needs solving and the value of pivoting when an initial idea is not viable. It also emphasizes the importance of adapting to market needs and learning from failure.

Paul Graham,The Four Quadrants of Conformism.txt,"July 2020
One of the most revealing ways to classify people is by the degree
and aggressiveness of their conformism. Imagine a Cartesian coordinate
system whose horizontal axis runs from conventional-minded on the
left to independent-minded on the right, and whose vertical axis
runs from passive at the bottom to aggressive at the top. The
resulting four quadrants define four types of people. Starting in
the upper left and going counter-clockwise: aggressively
conventional-minded, passively conventional-minded, passively
independent-minded, and aggressively independent-minded. I think that you'll find all four types in most societies, and that
which quadrant people fall into depends more on their own personality
than the beliefs prevalent in their society. [1]
Young children offer some of the best evidence for both points. Anyone who's been to primary school has seen the four types, and
the fact that school rules are so arbitrary is strong evidence that
which quadrant people fall into depends more on them than the rules. The kids in the upper left quadrant, the aggressively conventional-minded
ones, are the tattletales. They believe not only that rules must
be obeyed, but that those who disobey them must be punished. The kids in the lower left quadrant, the passively conventional-minded,
are the sheep. They're careful to obey the rules, but when other
kids break them, their impulse is to worry that those kids will be
punished, not to ensure that they will. The kids in the lower right quadrant, the passively independent-minded,
are the dreamy ones. They don't care much about rules and probably
aren't 100% sure what the rules even are. And the kids in the upper right quadrant, the aggressively
independent-minded, are the naughty ones. When they see a rule,
their first impulse is to question it. Merely being told what to
do makes them inclined to do the opposite. When measuring conformism, of course, you have to say with respect
to what, and this changes as kids get older. For younger kids it's
the rules set by adults. But as kids get older, the source of rules
becomes their peers. So a pack of teenagers who all flout school
rules in the same way are not independent-minded; rather the opposite. In adulthood we can recognize the four types by their distinctive
calls, much as you could recognize four species of birds. The call
of the aggressively conventional-minded is ""Crush <outgroup>!"" (It's
rather alarming to see an exclamation point after a variable, but
that's the whole problem with the aggressively conventional-minded.)
The call of the passively conventional-minded is ""What will the
neighbors think?"" The call of the passively independent-minded is
""To each his own."" And the call of the aggressively independent-minded
is ""Eppur si muove.""
The four types are not equally common. There are more passive people
than aggressive ones, and far more conventional-minded people than
independent-minded ones. So the passively conventional-minded are
the largest group, and the aggressively independent-minded the
smallest.","Since one's quadrant depends more on one's personality than the nature of the rules, most people would occupy the same quadrant even if they'd grown up in a quite different society. Princeton professor Robert George recently wrote: I sometimes ask students what their position on slavery would have been had they been white and living in the South before abolition. Guess what? They all would have been abolitionists! They all would have bravely spoken out against slavery, and worked tirelessly against it. He's too polite to say so, but of course they wouldn't. And indeed, our default assumption should not merely be that his students would, on average, have behaved the same way people did at the time, but that the ones who are aggressively conventional-minded today would have been aggressively conventional-minded then too. In other words, that they'd not only not have fought against slavery, but that they'd have been among its staunchest defenders. I'm biased, I admit, but it seems to me that aggressively conventional-minded people are responsible for a disproportionate amount of the trouble in the world, and that a lot of the customs we've evolved since the Enlightenment have been designed to protect the rest of us from them. In particular, the retirement of the concept of heresy and its replacement by the principle of freely debating all sorts of different ideas, even ones that are currently considered unacceptable, without any punishment for those who try them out to see if they work. [2] Why do the independent-minded need to be protected, though? Because they have all the new ideas. To be a successful scientist, for example, it's not enough just to be right. You have to be right when everyone else is wrong. Conventional-minded people can't do that. For similar reasons, all successful startup CEOs are not merely independent-minded, but aggressively so. So it's no coincidence that societies prosper only to the extent that they have customs for keeping the conventional-minded at bay. [3] In the last few years, many of us have noticed that the customs protecting free inquiry have been weakened. Some say we're overreacting — that they haven't been weakened very much, or that they've been weakened in the service of a greater good. The latter I'll dispose of immediately. When the conventional-minded get the upper hand, they always say it's in the service of a greater good. It just happens to be a different, incompatible greater good each time. As for the former worry, that the independent-minded are being oversensitive, and that free inquiry hasn't been shut down that much, you can't judge that unless you are yourself independent-minded. You can't know how much of the space of ideas is being lopped off unless you have them, and only the independent-minded have the ones at the edges. Precisely because of this, they tend to be very sensitive to changes in how freely one can explore ideas. They're the canaries in this coalmine. The conventional-minded say, as they always do, that they","But even the largest group, the passively conventional-minded,
are not a monolithic block. They are not all the same. Some of them are more
passive than others. Some of them are more conventional than others. But in their overall
orientation, they are conventional and passive. The same is true of the other three types. And, in fact, the
passively conventional-minded are the ones who have the most
influence in society. In this way, the passively conventional-minded are the
quiet ones who are not always seen, but who are the most
influential in the world. The passively independent-minded are the ones who
often speak up and are the most visible, but they are not the most
influence. The aggressively independent-minded are the most
original, but the most controversial. And the aggressively conventional-minded are the most
dominant, but the most feared. [2]
Now that we have this classification system, let's consider
how it might affect people's behavior in a situation where they are
in a group. If you're in a group, your behavior is likely to be influenced
by the group. If you're in a group, you are more likely to conform
to the group. In fact, there's a well-known experiment that shows that
people in groups are more likely to conform. The Asch experiment, where people were asked to
judge the length of a line, and they were asked to give their
judgment in front of others. The experiment showed that when people were in groups, they
were more likely to conform. But that's when the group is wrong. When the group is right, people are less likely to conform.
So, the Asch experiment is not a demonstration of conformity in
general, but of the tendency to conform when the group is wrong.
So, when the group is right, people are more likely to go with
their own judgment.",485,500,308,0.1552,0.1706,0.9394,0.9611,0.8995,0.8624,1.9796,-2.4384,0.3993,0.4245,0.0797,0.1053,0.0137,0.0474,0.5334,0.6811,0.9537,0.9713,0.42579505300353354,0.48198970840480276,0.532033426183844,7,7,0.9266,0.9496,0.20412371134020618,0.19,0.18831168831168832,0.8673,0.7579,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,Lies We Tell Kids.txt,"May 2008
Adults lie constantly to kids. I'm not saying we should stop, but
I think we should at least examine which lies we tell and why. There may also be a benefit to us. We were all lied to as kids,
and some of the lies we were told still affect us. So by studying
the ways adults lie to kids, we may be able to clear our heads of
lies we were told. I'm using the word ""lie"" in a very general sense: not just overt
falsehoods, but also all the more subtle ways we mislead kids. Though ""lie"" has negative connotations, I don't mean to suggest we
should never do this—just that we should pay attention when
we do. [1]
One of the most remarkable things about the way we lie to kids is
how broad the conspiracy is. All adults know what their culture
lies to kids about: they're the questions you answer ""Ask
your parents."" If a kid asked who won the World Series in 1982
or what the atomic weight of carbon was, you could just tell him. But if a kid asks you ""Is there a God?"" or ""What's a prostitute?""
you'll probably say ""Ask your parents.""
Since we all agree, kids see few cracks in the view of the world
presented to them. The biggest disagreements are between parents
and schools, but even those are small. Schools are careful what
they say about controversial topics, and if they do contradict what
parents want their kids to believe, parents either pressure the
school into keeping
quiet or move their kids to a new school. The conspiracy is so thorough that most kids who discover it do so
only by discovering internal contradictions in what they're told. It can be traumatic for the ones who wake up during the operation. Here's what happened to Einstein:
Through the reading of popular scientific books I soon reached
the conviction that much in the stories of the Bible could not
be true. The consequence was a positively fanatic freethinking
coupled with the impression that youth is intentionally being
deceived by the state through lies: it was a crushing impression. [2]
I remember that feeling. By 15 I was convinced the world was corrupt
from end to end. That's why movies like The Matrix have such
resonance. Every kid grows up in a fake world. In a way it would
be easier if the forces behind it were as clearly differentiated
as a bunch of evil machines, and one could make a clean break just by
taking a pill. Protection
If you ask adults why they lie to kids, the most common reason they
give is to protect them. And kids do need protecting. The environment
you want to create for a newborn child will be quite unlike the
streets of a big city. That seems so obvious it seems wrong to call it a lie.","It's certainly not a bad lie to tell, to give a baby the impression the world is quiet and warm and safe. But this harmless type of lie can turn sour if left unexamined. Imagine if you tried to keep someone in as protected an environment as a newborn till age 18. To mislead someone so grossly about the world would seem not protection but abuse. That's an extreme example, of course; when parents do that sort of thing it becomes national news. But you see the same problem on a smaller scale in the malaise teenagers feel in suburbia. The main purpose of suburbia is to provide a protected environment for children to grow up in. And it seems great for 10 year olds. I liked living in suburbia when I was 10. I didn't notice how sterile it was. My whole world was no bigger than a few friends' houses I bicycled to and some woods I ran around in. On a log scale I was midway between crib and globe. A suburban street was just the right size. But as I grew older, suburbia started to feel suffocatingly fake. Life can be pretty good at 10 or 20, but it's often frustrating at 15. This is too big a problem to solve here, but certainly one reason life sucks at 15 is that kids are trapped in a world designed for 10 year olds. What do parents hope to protect their children from by raising them in suburbia? A friend who moved out of Manhattan said merely that her 3 year old daughter ""saw too much."" Off the top of my head, that might include: people who are high or drunk, poverty, madness, gruesome medical conditions, sexual behavior of various degrees of oddness, and violent anger. I think it's the anger that would worry me most if I had a 3 year old. I was 29 when I moved to New York and I was surprised even then. I wouldn't want a 3 year old to see some of the disputes I saw. It would be too frightening. A lot of the things adults conceal from smaller children, they conceal because they'd be frightening, not because they want to conceal the existence of such things. Misleading the child is just a byproduct. This seems one of the most justifiable types of lying adults do to kids. But because the lies are indirect we don't keep a very strict accounting of them. Parents know they've concealed the facts about sex, and many at some point sit their kids down and explain more. But few tell their kids about the differences between the real world and the cocoon they grew up in. Combine this with the confidence parents try to instill in their kids, and every year you get a new crop of 18 year olds who think they know how to run the world. Don't all 18 year olds think they know how to run the world? Actually","But the problem is that the world is not as safe as you think it is.
So the question is: what do we protect the kids from? We protect them from
the bad things in the world. We protect them from the fact that
life is not perfect, that there are people who are not nice, and
that people do bad things. We protect them from the
knowledge that they can be hurt, that they can be
abused, that they can be killed. We protect them from the
knowledge that they can be lonely, that they can be
disowned, that they can be rejected. We protect them from the
knowledge that they can be lied to, that they can be
deceived, that they can be tricked. [3]
But if we protect them from everything, we are not protecting them
at all. That's a paradox. We can't protect them from every
danger, so we have to be selective. So, we pick and choose what we
protect them from. We protect them from the most harmful things.
We protect them from the things that cause the most pain. We protect
them from the things that we know are the most dangerous. So
the question is: what are the most dangerous things that kids
shouldn't know? That's the big question. [4]
It's not that we don't want to tell the truth, but that we are
influenced by our own fears. We have fears of our own. We are
afraid of the unknown. We are afraid of the future. We are afraid of
the consequences of the truth. We are afraid of the truth
because we know that the truth may be painful. We are afraid
of the truth because we know that the truth may be
disastrous. [5]
It's also true that we are afraid of the truth because we
know that the truth may cause us to be discredited",488,500,317,0.2397,0.1148,0.9536,0.8961,0.9281,0.7861,-1.2349,-3.6724,0.3862,0.3813,0.0481,0.0394,0.0043,0.0,0.5604,0.4611,0.9814,0.9522,0.46415770609318996,0.44802867383512546,0.5831062670299727,7,4,0.9429,0.9319,0.14344262295081966,0.122,0.15772870662460567,0.9782,0.4837,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,Putting Ideas into Words.txt,"February 2022
Writing about something, even something you know well, usually shows
you that you didn't know it as well as you thought. Putting ideas
into words is a severe test. The first words you choose are usually
wrong; you have to rewrite sentences over and over to
get them exactly right. And your ideas won't just be imprecise, but
incomplete too. Half the ideas that end up in an essay will be ones
you thought of while you were writing it. Indeed, that's why I write
them. Once you publish something, the convention is that whatever you
wrote was what you thought before you wrote it. These were your
ideas, and now you've expressed them. But you know this isn't true. You know that putting your ideas into words changed them. And not
just the ideas you published. Presumably there were others that
turned out to be too broken to fix, and those you discarded instead. It's not just having to commit your ideas to specific words that
makes writing so exacting. The real test is reading what you've
written. You have to pretend to be a neutral reader who knows nothing
of what's in your head, only what you wrote. When he reads what you
wrote, does it seem correct? Does it seem complete? If you make an
effort, you can read your writing as if you were a complete stranger,
and when you do the news is usually bad. It takes me many cycles
before I can get an essay past the stranger. But the stranger is
rational, so you always can, if you ask him what he needs. If he's
not satisfied because you failed to mention x or didn't qualify
some sentence sufficiently, then you mention x or add more
qualifications. Happy now? It may cost you some nice sentences, but
you have to resign yourself to that. You just have to make them as
good as you can and still satisfy the stranger. This much, I assume, won't be that controversial. I think it will
accord with the experience of anyone who has tried to write about
anything nontrivial. There may exist people whose thoughts are so
perfectly formed that they just flow straight into words. But I've
never known anyone who could do this, and if I met someone who said
they could, it would seem evidence of their limitations rather than
their ability. Indeed, this is a trope in movies: the guy who claims
to have a plan for doing some difficult thing, and who when questioned
further, taps his head and says ""It's all up here."" Everyone watching
the movie knows what that means. At best the plan is vague and
incomplete. Very likely there's some undiscovered flaw that invalidates
it completely. At best it's a plan for a plan. In precisely defined domains it's possible to form complete ideas
in your head. People can play chess in their heads, for example.","And mathematicians can do some amount of math in their heads, though they don't seem to feel sure of a proof over a certain length till they write it down. But this only seems possible with ideas you can express in a formal language. [1] Arguably what such people are doing is putting ideas into words in their heads. I can to some extent write essays in my head. I'll sometimes think of a paragraph while walking or lying in bed that survives nearly unchanged in the final version. But really I'm writing when I do this. I'm doing the mental part of writing; my fingers just aren't moving as I do it. [2] You can know a great deal about something without writing about it. Can you ever know so much that you wouldn't learn more from trying to explain what you know? I don't think so. I've written about at least two subjects I know well — Lisp hacking and startups — and in both cases I learned a lot from writing about them. In both cases there were things I didn't consciously realize till I had to explain them. And I don't think my experience was anomalous. A great deal of knowledge is unconscious, and experts have if anything a higher proportion of unconscious knowledge than beginners. I'm not saying that writing is the best way to explore all ideas. If you have ideas about architecture, presumably the best way to explore them is to build actual buildings. What I'm saying is that however much you learn from exploring ideas in other ways, you'll still learn new things from writing about them. Putting ideas into words doesn't have to mean writing, of course. You can also do it the old way, by talking. But in my experience, writing is the stricter test. You have to commit to a single, optimal sequence of words. Less can go unsaid when you don't have tone of voice to carry meaning. And you can focus in a way that would seem excessive in conversation. I'll often spend 2 weeks on an essay and reread drafts 50 times. If you did that in conversation it would seem evidence of some kind of mental disorder. If you're lazy, of course, writing and talking are equally useless. But if you want to push yourself to get things right, writing is the steeper hill. [3] The reason I've spent so long establishing this rather obvious point is that it leads to another that many people will find shocking. If writing down your ideas always makes them more precise and more complete, then no one who hasn't written about a topic has fully formed ideas about it. And someone who never writes has no fully formed ideas about anything nontrivial. It feels to them as if they do, especially if they're not in the habit of critically examining their own thinking. Ideas can feel complete. It's only when you try to put them into words that","But
outside of those domains, the process of forming an idea is
something that requires you to be outside of your head, to write
down your thoughts and then to re-examine them. So, the point is that writing is not just about committing ideas
to words. It's about getting them right. The point is that the
process of writing is not just about expressing what you think
but about getting to know what you think. In fact, the
process of writing is a way of knowing. So, the whole point of writing is not to get it right, but to
learn what you think. The more you write, the more you learn about yourself. The more
you write, the more you understand what you think. The more
you write, the more you understand what you are. The more you
write, the more you understand what you're trying to say. The more you write, the more you understand what you're trying to
say. The more you write, the more you understand what you're trying to
say. The more you write, the more you understand what you're trying to
say. So, the whole point of writing is not to get it right, but to
learn what you think. So, the whole point of writing is not to get it right, but to
learn what you think. The more you write, the more you understand what you think.

This is a very long text. I need to summarize it in one sentence. What would that be?
Okay, the user wants a one-sentence summary of this long text. Let me read through it again to get the main points. The text talks about how writing is a process of discovery, not just about getting the words right. It emphasizes that writing helps you understand your own thoughts better, and that the act of writing itself changes your ideas. The author argues that the purpose isn't to produce a perfect piece but to learn about",491,500,330,0.3478,0.1664,0.9297,0.9221,0.9211,0.9722,1.2416,-0.4024,0.4384,0.3463,0.071,0.0293,0.0132,0.0,0.6066,0.6688,0.9746,0.9606,0.492091388400703,0.4642233856893543,0.5447368421052632,5,7,0.9603,0.9707,0.15885947046843177,0.146,0.15757575757575756,0.9226,0.5305,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,Good and Bad Procrastination.txt,"December 2005
The most impressive people I know are all terrible procrastinators. So could it be that procrastination isn't always bad? Most people who write about procrastination write about how to cure
it. But this is, strictly speaking, impossible. There are an
infinite number of things you could be doing. No matter what you
work on, you're not working on everything else. So the question
is not how to avoid procrastination, but how to procrastinate well. There are three variants of procrastination, depending on what you
do instead of working on something: you could work on (a) nothing,
(b) something less important, or (c) something more important. That
last type, I'd argue, is good procrastination. That's the ""absent-minded professor,"" who forgets to shave, or eat,
or even perhaps look where he's going while he's thinking about
some interesting question. His mind is absent from the everyday
world because it's hard at work in another. That's the sense in which the most impressive people I know are all
procrastinators. They're type-C procrastinators: they put off
working on small stuff to work on big stuff. What's ""small stuff?"" Roughly, work that has zero chance of being
mentioned in your obituary. It's hard to say at the time what will
turn out to be your best work (will it be your magnum opus on
Sumerian temple architecture, or the detective thriller you wrote
under a pseudonym?), but there's a whole class of tasks you can
safely rule out: shaving, doing your laundry, cleaning the house,
writing thank-you notes—anything that might be called an errand. Good procrastination is avoiding errands to do real work. Good in a sense, at least. The people who want you to do the errands
won't think it's good. But you probably have to annoy them if you
want to get anything done. The mildest seeming people, if they
want to do real work, all have a certain degree of ruthlessness
when it comes to avoiding errands. Some errands, like replying to letters, go away if you
ignore them (perhaps taking friends with them). Others, like mowing
the lawn, or filing tax returns, only get worse if you put them
off. In principle it shouldn't work to put off the second kind of
errand. You're going to have to do whatever it is eventually. Why
not (as past-due notices are always saying) do it now? The reason it pays to put off even those errands is that real work
needs two things errands don't: big chunks of time, and the
right mood. If you get inspired by some project, it can be a net
win to blow off everything you were supposed to do for the next few
days to work on it. Yes, those errands may cost you more time when
you finally get around to them. But if you get a lot done during
those few days, you will be net more productive. In fact, it may not be a difference in degree, but a difference in
kind.","There may be types of work that can only be done in long, uninterrupted stretches, when inspiration hits, rather than dutifully in scheduled little slices. Empirically it seems to be so. When I think of the people I know who've done great things, I don't imagine them dutifully crossing items off to-do lists. I imagine them sneaking off to work on some new idea. Conversely, forcing someone to perform errands synchronously is bound to limit their productivity. The cost of an interruption is not just the time it takes, but that it breaks the time on either side in half. You probably only have to interrupt someone a couple times a day before they're unable to work on hard problems at all. I've wondered a lot about why startups are most productive at the very beginning, when they're just a couple guys in an apartment. The main reason may be that there's no one to interrupt them yet. In theory it's good when the founders finally get enough money to hire people to do some of the work for them. But it may be better to be overworked than interrupted. Once you dilute a startup with ordinary office workers—with type-B procrastinators—the whole company starts to resonate at their frequency. They're interrupt-driven, and soon you are too. Errands are so effective at killing great projects that a lot of people use them for that purpose. Someone who has decided to write a novel, for example, will suddenly find that the house needs cleaning. People who fail to write novels don't do it by sitting in front of a blank page for days without writing anything. They do it by feeding the cat, going out to buy something they need for their apartment, meeting a friend for coffee, checking email. ""I don't have time to work,"" they say. And they don't; they've made sure of that. (There's also a variant where one has no place to work. The cure is to visit the places where famous people worked, and see how unsuitable they were.) I've used both these excuses at one time or another. I've learned a lot of tricks for making myself work over the last 20 years, but even now I don't win consistently. Some days I get real work done. Other days are eaten up by errands. And I know it's usually my fault: I let errands eat up the day, to avoid facing some hard problem. The most dangerous form of procrastination is unacknowledged type-B procrastination, because it doesn't feel like procrastination. You're ""getting things done."" Just the wrong things. Any advice about procrastination that concentrates on crossing things off your to-do list is not only incomplete, but positively misleading, if it doesn't consider the possibility that the to-do list is itself a form of type-B procrastination. In fact, possibility is too weak a word. Nearly everyone's is. Unless you're working on the biggest things you could be working on, you're type-B procrastinating, no matter how much you're","The person who is not a procrastinator, who is always on
task, is not really doing anything. The person who is a procrastinator, who is always putting off
things, is doing something. The person who is doing something is the one who is actually
creating. The person who is not doing anything is the one who is
not creating. The point is, procrastination is not the same as not working. It's the
opposite. It's a way of working. So, the conclusion is: procrastination is not a vice, but a
virtue. It's not a flaw, but a strength. It's not something to be
avoided, but something to be cultivated. The question is, how?

Paul Graham,The Top Idea in Your Mind .txt,"Want to start a startup? Get funded by
Y Combinator. July 2010
I realized recently that what one thinks about in the shower in the
morning is more important than I'd thought. I knew it was a good
time to have ideas. Now I'd go further: now I'd say it's hard to
do a really good job on anything you don't think about in the shower. Everyone who's worked on difficult problems is probably familiar
with the phenomenon of working hard to figure something out, failing,
and then suddenly seeing the answer a bit later while doing something
else. There's a kind of thinking you do without trying to. I'm
increasingly convinced this type of thinking is not merely helpful
in solving hard problems, but necessary. The tricky part is, you
can only control it indirectly. [1]
I think most people have one top idea in their mind at any given
time. That's the idea their thoughts will drift toward when they're
allowed to drift freely. And this idea will thus tend to get all
the benefit of that type of thinking, while others are starved of
it. Which means it's a disaster to let the wrong idea become the
top one in your mind. What made this clear to me was having an idea I didn't want as the
top one in my mind for two long stretches. I'd noticed startups got way less done when they started raising
money, but it was not till we ourselves raised money that I understood
why. The problem is not the actual time it takes to meet with
investors. The problem is that once you start raising money, raising
money becomes the top idea in your mind. That becomes what you
think about when you take a shower in the morning. And that means
other questions aren't. I'd hated raising money when I was running Viaweb, but I'd forgotten
why I hated it so much. When we raised money for Y Combinator, I
remembered. Money matters are particularly likely to become the
top idea in your mind. The reason is that they have to be. It's
hard to get money. It's not the sort of thing that happens by
default. It's not going to happen unless you let it become the
thing you think about in the shower. And then you'll make little
progress on anything else you'd rather be working on. [2]
(I hear similar complaints from friends who are professors. Professors
nowadays seem to have become professional fundraisers who do a
little research on the side. It may be time to fix that.)
The reason this struck me so forcibly is that for most of the
preceding 10 years I'd been able to think about what I wanted. So
the contrast when I couldn't was sharp. But I don't think this
problem is unique to me, because just about every startup I've seen
grinds to a halt when they start raising money — or talking
to acquirers.","You can't directly control where your thoughts drift. If you're controlling them, they're not drifting. But you can control them indirectly, by controlling what situations you let yourself get into. That has been the lesson for me: be careful what you let become critical to you. Try to get yourself into situations where the most urgent problems are ones you want to think about. You don't have complete control, of course. An emergency could push other thoughts out of your head. But barring emergencies you have a good deal of indirect control over what becomes the top idea in your mind. I've found there are two types of thoughts especially worth avoiding — thoughts like the Nile Perch in the way they push out more interesting ideas. One I've already mentioned: thoughts about money. Getting money is almost by definition an attention sink. The other is disputes. These too are engaging in the wrong way: they have the same velcro-like shape as genuinely interesting ideas, but without the substance. So avoid disputes if you want to get real work done. [3] Even Newton fell into this trap. After publishing his theory of colors in 1672 he found himself distracted by disputes for years, finally concluding that the only solution was to stop publishing: I see I have made myself a slave to Philosophy, but if I get free of Mr Linus's business I will resolutely bid adew to it eternally, excepting what I do for my privat satisfaction or leave to come out after me. For I see a man must either resolve to put out nothing new or become a slave to defend it. [4] Linus and his students at Liege were among the more tenacious critics. Newton's biographer Westfall seems to feel he was overreacting: Recall that at the time he wrote, Newton's ""slavery"" consisted of five replies to Liege, totalling fourteen printed pages, over the course of a year. I'm more sympathetic to Newton. The problem was not the 14 pages, but the pain of having this stupid controversy constantly reintroduced as the top idea in a mind that wanted so eagerly to think about other things. Turning the other cheek turns out to have selfish advantages. Someone who does you an injury hurts you twice: first by the injury itself, and second by taking up your time afterward thinking about it. If you learn to ignore injuries you can at least avoid the second half. I've found I can to some extent avoid thinking about nasty things people have done to me by telling myself: this doesn't deserve space in my head. I'm always delighted to find I've forgotten the details of disputes, because that means I hadn't been thinking about them. My wife thinks I'm more forgiving than she is, but my motives are purely selfish. I suspect a lot of people aren't sure what's the top idea in their mind at any given time. I'm often mistaken about it. I tend to think it's","[3]
So, in the end, the most important thing is to get the right idea
in your mind. If you have the right idea, you'll do a lot of good
thinking and make a lot of progress. If you have the right idea,
you can also be more productive. If you have the right idea, you
can also be more creative. If you have the right idea, you can
also be more efficient. [4]
So, in the background, I've been thinking about how to get the
right idea. The most important thing, I think, is to have the right
idea in your mind at the beginning. But then again, the most

motive for his rejection of the Ptolemaic system....""

fanatically in his insistence that an airplane that looked

""Beauty is the first test: there is no permanent place in this
world for ugly mathematics.""
- G. H. Hardy, A Mathematician's Apology
I was talking recently to a friend who teaches
at MIT. His field is hot now and
every year he is inundated by applications from
would-be graduate students. ""A lot of them seem smart,""
he said. ""What I can't tell is whether they have any kind
of taste.""
Taste. You don't hear that word much now. And yet we still need the underlying
concept, whatever we call it. What my friend meant was
that he wanted students who were not just good technicians,
but who could use their technical knowledge to
design beautiful things. Mathematicians call good work ""beautiful,""
and so, either now or in the past, have
scientists, engineers, musicians, architects, designers,
writers, and painters. Is it just a coincidence that they used the same word, or is
there some overlap in what they meant? If there
is an overlap, can we use one field's discoveries
about beauty to help us in another? For those of us who design things, these are not just
theoretical questions. If there is such a thing as
beauty, we need to be able to recognize it. We need
good taste to make good things. Instead of
treating beauty as an airy abstraction, to be either blathered
about or avoided depending on how one feels about airy
abstractions, let's try considering it as a practical question:
how do you make good stuff? If you mention taste nowadays, a lot of people will tell
you that ""taste is subjective.""
They believe this because it really feels that
way to them. When they like something, they have no idea
why. It could be because it's beautiful, or because their
mother had one, or because they saw a movie star with one
in a magazine, or because they know it's expensive. Their thoughts are a tangle of unexamined impulses. Most of us are encouraged, as children, to leave this tangle
unexamined. If you make fun of your little brother for
coloring people green in his coloring book, your
mother is likely to tell you something like ""you like to
do it your way and he likes to do it his way.""
Your mother at this point is not trying to teach you
important truths about aesthetics. She's trying to get
the two of you to stop bickering. Like many of the half-truths adults tell us, this one
contradicts other things they tell us.","After dinning into you that taste is merely a matter of personal preference, they take you to the museum and tell you that you should pay attention because Leonardo is a great artist. What goes through the kid's head at this point? What does he think ""great artist"" means? After having been told for years that everyone just likes to do things their own way, he is unlikely to head straight for the conclusion that a great artist is someone whose work is better than the others'. A far more likely theory, in his Ptolemaic model of the universe, is that a great artist is something that's good for you, like broccoli, because someone said so in a book. Saying that taste is just personal preference is a good way to prevent disputes. The trouble is, it's not true. You feel this when you start to design things. Whatever job people do, they naturally want to do better. Football players like to win games. CEOs like to increase earnings. It's a matter of pride, and a real pleasure, to get better at your job. But if your job is to design things, and there is no such thing as beauty, then there is no way to get better at your job. If taste is just personal preference, then everyone's is already perfect: you like whatever you like, and that's it. As in any job, as you continue to design things, you'll get better at it. Your tastes will change. And, like anyone who gets better at their job, you'll know you're getting better. If so, your old tastes were not merely different, but worse. Poof goes the axiom that taste can't be wrong. Relativism is fashionable at the moment, and that may hamper you from thinking about taste, even as yours grows. But if you come out of the closet and admit, at least to yourself, that there is such a thing as good and bad design, then you can start to study good design in detail. How has your taste changed? When you made mistakes, what caused you to make them? What have other people learned about design? Once you start to examine the question, it's surprising how much different fields' ideas of beauty have in common. The same principles of good design crop up again and again. Good design is simple. You hear this from math to painting. In math it means that a shorter proof tends to be a better one. Where axioms are concerned, especially, less is more. It means much the same thing in programming. For architects and designers it means that beauty should depend on a few carefully chosen structural elements rather than a profusion of superficial ornament. (Ornament is not in itself bad, only when it's camouflage on insipid form.) Similarly, in painting, a still life of a few carefully observed and solidly modelled objects will tend to be more interesting than a stretch of flashy but mindlessly repetitive painting of, say, a","""You are smart,""
they say, ""but you are not smart enough to know that
you're smart."" So, maybe it's not that taste is
subjective, but that we're not taught how to think about
taste. Maybe there is a way to think about it, and if we can
learn it, we can begin to make better things, not just
because we like them, but because we understand
why we like them. The idea of beauty as a test, as in the quote from Hardy, is one way of
thinking about it. So is the idea of aesthetic
objections, as in the quote from Kuhn. The idea that
""taste is subjective"" is a common way of thinking about
it, but that's not the only way. Maybe we can take a
step back and consider the meaning of ""taste."" The word comes from the Latin ""tastare,"" which means ""to taste."" So taste is something that can be experienced through the senses, but not just the senses. The word has a more general meaning, as in ""good taste."" The idea is that you know what is good, not just because you like it, but because you understand what is good. In the context of food, taste is the combination of the five senses that we use to determine what is good. But in the context of music, or art, or even design, the word taste is used in a similar way: we say that a piece of music has good taste if it's
not just enjoyable, but also well-made, or well-structured, or
even well-intentioned. The word ""taste"" is used in the same way in the quote from Hardy. He's not saying that mathematics must be beautiful, but that it must be beautiful, and that
the beauty is the first test. In that sense, the word
""taste"" is not just a matter of",474,500,308,0.2254,0.3166,0.9744,0.9483,0.9705,0.7831,-0.4573,4.2964,0.3861,0.4188,0.0611,0.0505,0.013,0.0098,0.5314,0.5953,0.9805,0.9598,0.4181494661921708,0.45051194539249145,0.49866666666666665,9,7,0.9385,0.9497,0.2109704641350211,0.172,0.22727272727272727,0.8652,0.5939,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,Ideas for Startups.txt,"Want to start a startup? Get funded by
Y Combinator. October 2005
(This essay is derived from a talk at the 2005
Startup School.)
How do you get good ideas for
startups? That's probably the number
one question people ask me. I'd like to reply with another question: why do people think it's
hard to come up with ideas for startups? That might seem a stupid thing to ask. Why do they think
it's hard? If people can't do it, then it is hard, at least
for them. Right? Well, maybe not. What people usually say is not that they can't
think of ideas, but that they don't have any. That's not quite the
same thing. It could be the reason they don't have any is that
they haven't tried to generate them. I think this is often the case. I think people believe that coming
up with ideas for startups is very hard-- that it must be
very hard-- and so they don't try do to it. They assume ideas are
like miracles: they either pop into your head or they don't. I also have a theory about why people think this. They overvalue
ideas. They think creating a startup is just a matter of implementing
some fabulous initial idea. And since a successful startup is worth
millions of dollars, a good idea is therefore a million dollar idea. If coming up with an idea for a startup equals coming up with a
million dollar idea, then of course it's going to seem hard. Too
hard to bother trying. Our instincts tell us something so valuable
would not be just lying around for anyone to discover. Actually, startup ideas are not million dollar ideas, and here's
an experiment you can try to prove it: just try to sell one. Nothing
evolves faster than markets. The fact that there's no market for
startup ideas suggests there's no demand. Which means, in the
narrow sense of the word, that startup ideas are worthless. Questions
The fact is, most startups end up nothing like the initial idea. It would be closer to the truth to say the main value of your initial
idea is that, in the process of discovering it's broken, you'll
come up with your real idea. The initial idea is just a starting point-- not a blueprint, but a
question. It might help if they were expressed that way. Instead
of saying that your idea is to make a collaborative, web-based
spreadsheet, say: could one make a collaborative, web-based
spreadsheet? A few grammatical tweaks, and a woefully incomplete
idea becomes a promising question to explore. There's a real difference, because an assertion provokes objections
in a way a question doesn't.","If you say: I'm going to build a web-based spreadsheet, then critics-- the most dangerous of which are in your own head-- will immediately reply that you'd be competing with Microsoft, that you couldn't give people the kind of UI they expect, that users wouldn't want to have their data on your servers, and so on. A question doesn't seem so challenging. It becomes: let's try making a web-based spreadsheet and see how far we get. And everyone knows that if you tried this you'd be able to make something useful. Maybe what you'd end up with wouldn't even be a spreadsheet. Maybe it would be some kind of new spreadsheet-like collaboration tool that doesn't even have a name yet. You wouldn't have thought of something like that except by implementing your way toward it. Treating a startup idea as a question changes what you're looking for. If an idea is a blueprint, it has to be right. But if it's a question, it can be wrong, so long as it's wrong in a way that leads to more ideas. One valuable way for an idea to be wrong is to be only a partial solution. When someone's working on a problem that seems too big, I always ask: is there some way to bite off some subset of the problem, then gradually expand from there? That will generally work unless you get trapped on a local maximum, like 1980s-style AI, or C. Upwind So far, we've reduced the problem from thinking of a million dollar idea to thinking of a mistaken question. That doesn't seem so hard, does it? To generate such questions you need two things: to be familiar with promising new technologies, and to have the right kind of friends. New technologies are the ingredients startup ideas are made of, and conversations with friends are the kitchen they're cooked in. Universities have both, and that's why so many startups grow out of them. They're filled with new technologies, because they're trying to produce research, and only things that are new count as research. And they're full of exactly the right kind of people to have ideas with: the other students, who will be not only smart but elastic-minded to a fault. The opposite extreme would be a well-paying but boring job at a big company. Big companies are biased against new technologies, and the people you'd meet there would be wrong too. In an essay I wrote for high school students, I said a good rule of thumb was to stay upwind-- to work on things that maximize your future options. The principle applies for adults too, though perhaps it has to be modified to: stay upwind for as long as you can, then cash in the potential energy you've accumulated when you need to pay for kids. I don't think people consciously realize this, but one reason downwind jobs like churning out Java for a bank pay so well is precisely that they are downwind. The","For example, if I say, ""We're going to make a
collaborative, web-based spreadsheet,"" you might say, ""That's
not a good idea."" If I say, ""Can we make a collaborative, web-based spreadsheet?"" you might say, ""We need to figure out what the
real problem is."" So the question form is more exploratory. That's a big difference. So the point is, the way to get good ideas for startups is to
generate questions. The more questions you can generate, the more ideas you'll get. But the key is to generate questions that are not just about
what to make, but also about what to do. You need to think about how to
build it, how to get people to use it, how to make money. And, of course, what
the problem is. So the idea is to ask not just, what is the product, but also
what is the business. The product and the business are both important. So if you want to generate ideas for startups, you should try to
generate questions. But how do you do that? One way is to ask what the
problems are. So the first step is to think about what problems people have. But how do you do that? One way is to talk to people. You can go to the coffee shop, and ask people what problems
they have. But that might be difficult. Maybe you can do some kind of
surveys. But I think the most effective way is to actually do
something. So, for example, if you're trying to find out what problems people
have with the way they pay their bills, you could go to a
store and try to pay your bills. You can try to do it in a way that's difficult. Then you'll
see what problems people have. So the way to find problems is to go out and try to do something
that's hard.",451,500,317,0.3149,0.3602,0.9799,0.9168,0.6617,0.9306,6.9088,-0.9374,0.4395,0.4845,0.0446,0.0804,0.008,0.028,0.5485,0.704,0.9734,0.9466,0.4288389513108614,0.4536082474226804,0.5039370078740157,6,6,0.9715,0.921,0.1951219512195122,0.184,0.2082018927444795,0.8388,0.7239,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,Default Alive or Default Dead_.txt,"October 2015
When I talk to a startup that's been operating for more than 8 or
9 months, the first thing I want to know is almost always the same. Assuming their expenses remain constant and their revenue growth
is what it has been over the last several months, do they make it to
profitability on the money they have left? Or to put it more
dramatically, by default do they live or die? The startling thing is how often the founders themselves don't know. Half the founders I talk to don't know whether they're default alive
or default dead. If you're among that number, Trevor Blackwell has made a handy
calculator you can use to find out. The reason I want to know first whether a startup is default alive
or default dead is that the rest of the conversation depends on the
answer. If the company is default alive, we can talk about ambitious
new things they could do. If it's default dead, we probably need
to talk about how to save it. We know the current trajectory ends
badly. How can they get off that trajectory? Why do so few founders know whether they're default alive or default
dead? Mainly, I think, because they're not used to asking that. It's not a question that makes sense to ask early on, any more than
it makes sense to ask a 3 year old how he plans to support
himself. But as the company grows older, the question switches from
meaningless to critical. That kind of switch often takes people
by surprise. I propose the following solution: instead of starting to ask too
late whether you're default alive or default dead, start asking too
early. It's hard to say precisely when the question switches
polarity. But it's probably not that dangerous to start worrying
too early that you're default dead, whereas it's very dangerous to
start worrying too late. The reason is a phenomenon I wrote about earlier: the
fatal pinch. The fatal pinch is default dead + slow growth + not enough
time to fix it. And the way founders end up in it is by not realizing
that's where they're headed. There is another reason founders don't ask themselves whether they're
default alive or default dead: they assume it will be easy to raise
more money. But that assumption is often false, and worse still, the
more you depend on it, the falser it becomes. Maybe it will help to separate facts from hopes. Instead of thinking
of the future with vague optimism, explicitly separate the components. Say ""We're default dead, but we're counting on investors to save
us."" Maybe as you say that, it will set off the same alarms in your
head that it does in mine. And if you set off the alarms sufficiently
early, you may be able to avoid the fatal pinch. It would be safe to be default dead if you could count on investors
saving you.","As a rule their interest is a function of growth. If you have steep revenue growth, say over 5x a year, you can start to count on investors being interested even if you're not profitable. [1] But investors are so fickle that you can never do more than start to count on them. Sometimes something about your business will spook investors even if your growth is great. So no matter how good your growth is, you can never safely treat fundraising as more than a plan A. You should always have a plan B as well: you should know (as in write down) precisely what you'll need to do to survive if you can't raise more money, and precisely when you'll have to switch to plan B if plan A isn't working. In any case, growing fast versus operating cheaply is far from the sharp dichotomy many founders assume it to be. In practice there is surprisingly little connection between how much a startup spends and how fast it grows. When a startup grows fast, it's usually because the product hits a nerve, in the sense of hitting some big need straight on. When a startup spends a lot, it's usually because the product is expensive to develop or sell, or simply because they're wasteful. If you're paying attention, you'll be asking at this point not just how to avoid the fatal pinch, but how to avoid being default dead. That one is easy: don't hire too fast. Hiring too fast is by far the biggest killer of startups that raise money. [2] Founders tell themselves they need to hire in order to grow. But most err on the side of overestimating this need rather than underestimating it. Why? Partly because there's so much work to do. Naive founders think that if they can just hire enough people, it will all get done. Partly because successful startups have lots of employees, so it seems like that's what one does in order to be successful. In fact the large staffs of successful startups are probably more the effect of growth than the cause. And partly because when founders have slow growth they don't want to face what is usually the real reason: the product is not appealing enough. Plus founders who've just raised money are often encouraged to overhire by the VCs who funded them. Kill-or-cure strategies are optimal for VCs because they're protected by the portfolio effect. VCs want to blow you up, in one sense of the phrase or the other. But as a founder your incentives are different. You want above all to survive. [3] Here's a common way startups die. They make something moderately appealing and have decent initial growth. They raise their first round fairly easily, because the founders seem smart and the idea sounds plausible. But because the product is only moderately appealing, growth is ok but not great. The founders convince themselves that hiring a bunch of people is the way to boost growth.","But that's not the same as being default alive. If you're default alive, then you can afford to be a little
unwilling to take the money. If you're default dead, you're in a race against time. And the time is running out. Now, I don't want to be overly pessimistic. I do think that many startups will be default alive. But I also think that many more will be default dead. But the question is not whether you're default alive or default dead. The question is whether you're default alive now. I think the answer is more important than the question. The key is not whether you can become default alive later, but whether you can be default alive now. The first question that founders should ask is: are we default alive now? The next question is: what are we doing to be default alive now? The answer to that is: not much. So the answer is: start now. I think the main message is this: if you're not sure if you're default alive or default dead, start now. I think the message is not that you should be default alive, but that you should be default alive now. That's the point. So, I think the main takeaway is: start now. Start now. Start now. That's the message. So, in the end, the question is not whether you're default alive or not. The question is: are you starting now? And that is the real question.

Paul Graham,Microsoft is Dead.txt,"April 2007
A few days ago I suddenly realized Microsoft was dead. I was talking
to a young startup founder about how Google was different from
Yahoo. I said that Yahoo had been warped from the start by
their fear of Microsoft. That was why they'd positioned themselves
as a ""media company"" instead of a technology company. Then I looked
at his face and realized he didn't understand. It was as if I'd
told him how much girls liked Barry Manilow in the mid
80s. Barry who? Microsoft? He didn't say anything, but I could tell he didn't quite
believe anyone would be frightened of them. Microsoft cast
a shadow over the software world for almost 20 years
starting in the late 80s. I can remember when it was IBM before them. I mostly ignored this
shadow. I never used Microsoft software, so it only affected me
indirectly—for example, in the spam I got from botnets. And
because I wasn't paying attention, I didn't notice when the shadow
disappeared. But it's gone now. I can sense that. No one is even afraid of
Microsoft anymore. They still make a lot of money—so does IBM,
for that matter. But they're not dangerous. When did Microsoft die, and of what? I know they seemed dangerous
as late as 2001, because I wrote an essay then
about how they were
less dangerous than they seemed. I'd guess they were dead by 2005. I know when we started Y Combinator we didn't worry about Microsoft
as competition for the startups we funded. In fact, we've never
even invited them to the demo days we organize for startups to
present to investors. We invite Yahoo and Google and some other
Internet companies, but we've never bothered to invite Microsoft. Nor has anyone there ever even sent us an email. They're in a
different world. What killed them? Four things, I think, all of them occurring
simultaneously in the mid 2000s. The most obvious is Google. There can only be one big man in town,
and they're clearly it. Google is the most dangerous company
now by far, in both the good and bad senses of the word. Microsoft
can at best limp along afterward. When did Google take the lead? There will be a tendency to push
it back to their IPO in August 2004, but they weren't setting the
terms of the debate then. I'd say they took the lead in
2005. Gmail was one of the things that put them over the edge. Gmail showed they could do more than search. Gmail also showed how much you could do with web-based software,
if you took advantage of what later came to be called ""Ajax."" And
that was the second cause of Microsoft's death: everyone can see the
desktop is over. It now seems inevitable that applications will
live on the web—not just email, but everything, right up to
Photoshop. Even Microsoft sees that now. Ironically, Microsoft unintentionally helped create Ajax.","The x in Ajax is from the XMLHttpRequest object, which lets the browser communicate with the server in the background while displaying a page. (Originally the only way to communicate with the server was to ask for a new page.) XMLHttpRequest was created by Microsoft in the late 90s because they needed it for Outlook. What they didn't realize was that it would be useful to a lot of other people too—in fact, to anyone who wanted to make web apps work like desktop ones. The other critical component of Ajax is Javascript, the programming language that runs in the browser. Microsoft saw the danger of Javascript and tried to keep it broken for as long as they could. [1] But eventually the open source world won, by producing Javascript libraries that grew over the brokenness of Explorer the way a tree grows over barbed wire. The third cause of Microsoft's death was broadband Internet. Anyone who cares can have fast Internet access now. And the bigger the pipe to the server, the less you need the desktop. The last nail in the coffin came, of all places, from Apple. Thanks to OS X, Apple has come back from the dead in a way that is extremely rare in technology. [2] Their victory is so complete that I'm now surprised when I come across a computer running Windows. Nearly all the people we fund at Y Combinator use Apple laptops. It was the same in the audience at startup school. All the computer people use Macs or Linux now. Windows is for grandmas, like Macs used to be in the 90s. So not only does the desktop no longer matter, no one who cares about computers uses Microsoft's anyway. And of course Apple has Microsoft on the run in music too, with TV and phones on the way. I'm glad Microsoft is dead. They were like Nero or Commodus—evil in the way only inherited power can make you. Because remember, the Microsoft monopoly didn't begin with Microsoft. They got it from IBM. The software business was overhung by a monopoly from about the mid-1950s to about 2005. For practically its whole existence, that is. One of the reasons ""Web 2.0"" has such an air of euphoria about it is the feeling, conscious or not, that this era of monopoly may finally be over. Of course, as a hacker I can't help thinking about how something broken could be fixed. Is there some way Microsoft could come back? In principle, yes. To see how, envision two things: (a) the amount of cash Microsoft now has on hand, and (b) Larry and Sergey making the rounds of all the search engines ten years ago trying to sell the idea for Google for a million dollars, and being turned down by everyone. The surprising fact is, brilliant hackers—dangerously brilliant hackers—can be had very cheaply, by the standards of a company as rich as Microsoft. They can't hire smart people anymore, but they could","The third thing that killed Microsoft was the rise of
the mobile web. When I was in the late 90s, the idea that the web would be
mobile was unthinkable. I remember sitting in a meeting in 1999, and a
senior exec at Microsoft said that the web would be mobile. I thought he was crazy. But now that we've gotten used to mobile, it's hard to imagine
that the web wouldn't be mobile. The fourth cause was the rise of the open source
movement. I was a big believer in open source. I think the
open source community has been very important in the
software world. But in the case of Microsoft, it's not that the open source
software was better or more powerful than Microsoft software. It's that open source software is more transparent, and more
open. But that's not the same as better. And it's not the same as more powerful. The open source movement is a bit like the
Celtic druids, who were not a threat to the Roman Empire
but were a sort of spiritual undercurrent. Open source is a movement that's not about making software
better, but about making software more open. But the point is, the open source movement made Microsoft
a lot less powerful. It made them more transparent. It made them less
important. And it made them more
untrustworthy. So, in a way, the open source movement is a
movement against Microsoft. In short, the four factors that killed Microsoft were:
1. Google's rise to dominance
2. The end of the desktop
3. The rise of the mobile web
4. The open source movement. So Microsoft is dead. But I don't think they're
completely dead. They're not completely dead, but they're
not as big as before. They're still a
major company, but not the dominant one. They still",497,500,307,0.2875,0.178,0.9332,0.9153,0.7749,0.9171,3.506,-1.0008,0.3893,0.3453,0.0457,0.0493,0.0042,0.0062,0.3622,0.6193,0.9614,0.9531,0.45077720207253885,0.43205574912891986,0.44846796657381616,8,6,0.9553,0.9906,0.1710261569416499,0.154,0.18241042345276873,0.9532,0.5995,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,Why to Not Not Start a Startup.txt,"Want to start a startup? Get funded by
Y Combinator. March 2007
(This essay is derived from talks at the 2007
Startup School and the Berkeley CSUA.)
We've now been doing Y Combinator long enough to have some data
about success rates. Our first batch, in the summer of 2005, had
eight startups in it. Of those eight, it now looks as if at least
four succeeded. Three have been acquired:
Reddit was a merger of
two, Reddit and Infogami, and a third was acquired that we can't
talk about yet. Another from that batch was
Loopt, which is doing
so well they could probably be acquired in about ten minutes if
they wanted to. So about half the founders from that first summer, less than two
years ago, are now rich, at least by their standards. (One thing
you learn when you get rich is that there are many degrees of it.)
I'm not ready to predict our success rate will stay as high as 50%. That first batch could have been an anomaly. But we should be able
to do better than the oft-quoted (and probably made
up) standard figure of 10%. I'd feel safe aiming at 25%. Even the founders who fail don't seem to have such a bad time. Of
those first eight startups, three are now probably dead. In two
cases the founders just went on to do other things at the end of
the summer. I don't think they were traumatized by the experience. The closest to a traumatic failure was Kiko, whose founders kept
working on their startup for a whole year before being squashed by
Google Calendar. But they ended up happy. They sold their software
on eBay for a quarter of a million dollars. After they paid back
their angel investors, they had about a year's salary each. [1]
Then they immediately went on to start a new and much more exciting
startup, Justin.TV. So here is an even more striking statistic: 0% of that first batch
had a terrible experience. They had ups and downs, like every
startup, but I don't think any would have traded it for a job in a
cubicle. And that statistic is probably not an anomaly. Whatever
our long-term success rate ends up being, I think the rate of people
who wish they'd gotten a regular job will stay close to 0%. The big mystery to me is: why don't more people start startups? If
nearly everyone who does it prefers it to a regular job, and a
significant percentage get rich, why doesn't everyone want to do
this? A lot of people think we get thousands of applications for
each funding cycle. In fact we usually only get several hundred. Why don't more people apply? And while it must seem to anyone
watching this world that startups are popping up like crazy, the
number is small compared to the number of people with the necessary
skills.","The great majority of programmers still go straight from college to cubicle, and stay there. It seems like people are not acting in their own interest. What's going on? Well, I can answer that. Because of Y Combinator's position at the very start of the venture funding process, we're probably the world's leading experts on the psychology of people who aren't sure if they want to start a company. There's nothing wrong with being unsure. If you're a hacker thinking about starting a startup and hesitating before taking the leap, you're part of a grand tradition. Larry and Sergey seem to have felt the same before they started Google, and so did Jerry and Filo before they started Yahoo. In fact, I'd guess the most successful startups are the ones started by uncertain hackers rather than gung-ho business guys. We have some evidence to support this. Several of the most successful startups we've funded told us later that they only decided to apply at the last moment. Some decided only hours before the deadline. The way to deal with uncertainty is to analyze it into components. Most people who are reluctant to do something have about eight different reasons mixed together in their heads, and don't know themselves which are biggest. Some will be justified and some bogus, but unless you know the relative proportion of each, you don't know whether your overall uncertainty is mostly justified or mostly bogus. So I'm going to list all the components of people's reluctance to start startups, and explain which are real. Then would-be founders can use this as a checklist to examine their own feelings. I admit my goal is to increase your self-confidence. But there are two things different here from the usual confidence-building exercise. One is that I'm motivated to be honest. Most people in the confidence-building business have already achieved their goal when you buy the book or pay to attend the seminar where they tell you how great you are. Whereas if I encourage people to start startups who shouldn't, I make my own life worse. If I encourage too many people to apply to Y Combinator, it just means more work for me, because I have to read all the applications. The other thing that's going to be different is my approach. Instead of being positive, I'm going to be negative. Instead of telling you ""come on, you can do it"" I'm going to consider all the reasons you aren't doing it, and show why most (but not all) should be ignored. We'll start with the one everyone's born with. 1. Too young A lot of people think they're too young to start a startup. Many are right. The median age worldwide is about 27, so probably a third of the population can truthfully say they're too young. What's too young? One of our goals with Y Combinator was to discover the lower bound on the age of startup founders. It always seemed to us that investors","So the answer must be that people are not aware of
the opportunity. If they were, they would be applying. So I think the main thing that we need to do is to make it easier
for people to find out about the program. We need to make
the program more known. We need to make it more accessible. We need to make it more
easier to apply. We need to make it more clear what the program is about.
We need to make it more obvious that the program is for people
who are looking to start a startup, and that it's a great way to
do it. I think the most important thing is to make the program
more known. If the program was more known, then more people would
apply. And then we would get more people to be in the program. Then we
would get more people to be successful. So that's the plan. We are trying to make the program more known. And the way to do that is to do more
publicity, to do more talks, to do more interviews, to do more
articles, to do more outreach. We are also trying to make the program more accessible. For example, the program is now in the
US and Canada. We are looking to expand it to other countries. We are also
trying to make it easier to apply. We are working on a new
application process that will make it easier for people to apply
to the program. We're also trying to make the program more clear. We are trying to
make it more clear that the program is for people who want to start
a startup. We are also trying to make it more clear that the program is a
great way to do it. We are trying to make it more obvious that the program is for people
who are looking to start a startup, and that it's a great way to do
it. So the plan is to make the program more",492,500,341,0.2175,0.0911,0.9698,0.8259,0.9566,0.9254,0.6765,-1.1118,0.3782,0.3145,0.0415,0.0413,0.0063,0.0037,0.5774,0.2894,0.9785,0.9468,0.44405594405594406,0.4740484429065744,0.5582010582010583,7,7,0.9514,0.9395,0.15853658536585366,0.168,0.10850439882697947,0.9702,0.4392,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,A Unified Theory of VC Suckage.txt,"March 2005
A couple months ago I got an email from a recruiter asking if I was
interested in being a ""technologist in residence"" at a new venture
capital fund. I think the idea was to play Karl Rove to the VCs'
George Bush. I considered it for about four seconds. Work for a VC fund? Ick. One of my most vivid memories from our startup is going to visit
Greylock, the famous Boston VCs. They were the most arrogant
people I've met in my life. And I've met a lot of arrogant people. [1]
I'm not alone in feeling this way, of course. Even a VC friend of
mine dislikes VCs. ""Assholes,"" he says. But lately I've been learning more about how the VC world works,
and a few days ago it hit me that there's a reason VCs are the way
they are. It's not so much that the business attracts jerks, or
even that the power they wield corrupts them. The real problem is
the way they're paid. The problem with VC funds is that they're funds. Like the
managers of mutual funds or hedge funds, VCs get paid a percentage
of the money they manage: about 2% a year in management fees,
plus a percentage of the gains. So they want
the fund to be huge-- hundreds of millions of dollars, if possible. But that means each partner ends up being responsible for investing
a lot of money. And since one person can only manage so many deals,
each deal has to be for multiple millions of dollars. This turns out to explain nearly all the characteristics of VCs
that founders hate. It explains why VCs take so agonizingly long to make up their minds,
and why their due diligence feels like a body cavity search. [2]
With so much at stake, they have to be paranoid. It explains why they steal your ideas. Every founder knows that
VCs will tell your secrets to your competitors if they end up
investing in them. It's not unheard of for VCs to meet you when
they have no intention of funding you, just to pick your brain for
a competitor. This prospect makes naive founders clumsily secretive. Experienced founders treat it as a cost of doing business. Either
way it sucks. But again, the only reason VCs are so sneaky is the
giant deals they do. With so much at stake, they have to be devious. It explains why VCs tend to interfere in the companies they invest
in. They want to be on your board not just so that they can advise
you, but so that they can watch you. Often they even install a new
CEO. Yes, he may have extensive business experience. But he's
also their man: these newly installed CEOs always play something
of the role of a political commissar in a Red Army unit. With
so much at stake, VCs can't resist micromanaging you.","The huge investments themselves are something founders would dislike, if they realized how damaging they can be. VCs don't invest $x million because that's the amount you need, but because that's the amount the structure of their business requires them to invest. Like steroids, these sudden huge investments can do more harm than good. Google survived enormous VC funding because it could legitimately absorb large amounts of money. They had to buy a lot of servers and a lot of bandwidth to crawl the whole Web. Less fortunate startups just end up hiring armies of people to sit around having meetings. In principle you could take a huge VC investment, put it in treasury bills, and continue to operate frugally. You just try it. And of course giant investments mean giant valuations. They have to, or there's not enough stock left to keep the founders interested. You might think a high valuation is a great thing. Many founders do. But you can't eat paper. You can't benefit from a high valuation unless you can somehow achieve what those in the business call a ""liquidity event,"" and the higher your valuation, the narrower your options for doing that. Many a founder would be happy to sell his company for $15 million, but VCs who've just invested at a pre-money valuation of $8 million won't hear of that. You're rolling the dice again, whether you like it or not. Back in 1997, one of our competitors raised $20 million in a single round of VC funding. This was at the time more than the valuation of our entire company. Was I worried? Not at all: I was delighted. It was like watching a car you're chasing turn down a street that you know has no outlet. Their smartest move at that point would have been to take every penny of the $20 million and use it to buy us. We would have sold. Their investors would have been furious of course. But I think the main reason they never considered this was that they never imagined we could be had so cheap. They probably assumed we were on the same VC gravy train they were. In fact we only spent about $2 million in our entire existence. And that gave us flexibility. We could sell ourselves to Yahoo for $50 million, and everyone was delighted. If our competitor had done that, the last round of investors would presumably have lost money. I assume they could have vetoed such a deal. But no one those days was paying a lot more than Yahoo. So unless their founders could pull off an IPO (which would be difficult with Yahoo as a competitor), they had no choice but to ride the thing down. The puffed-up companies that went public during the Bubble didn't do it just because they were pulled into it by unscrupulous investment bankers. Most were pushed just as hard from the other side by VCs who'd invested at high valuations, leaving an","They
have to be in control. [3]
And here's the kicker: The way they're paid makes them
unwilling to take any risks. They have to have a large fund to
make money, and the only way to get that is to invest in a lot
of companies, which means they have to invest in a lot of
companies that are not going to make money. That's not just the case for VCs. It's the same
pattern for hedge funds, mutual funds, and even the
""high frequency"" trading that's done in the
financial markets. The more money you manage, the more
you have to be risk-averse. The more you have to be risk-averse, the more you
have to be conservative. The more conservative you are, the less
you can make. The less you can make, the less money you can manage. So it's a cycle that's very hard to break. This is the paradox of the fund: the more you want to make money, the more you have to be risk-averse. This is why the fund model is not
compatible with the entrepreneurial spirit. [4]
[1] I'm not sure if this is a real thing or a made-up story, but
I think it's the former. I remember hearing that Greylock was a very
arrogant and competitive place, and that they had a reputation
for being difficult to work with. But I don't know if the particular story I'm
remembering is real.
[2] I think this is the real reason. I've heard that VCs do
take a long time to make decisions, but I'm not sure if the
reason is the one I describe. However, the way they're paid makes it
clear that they have to be cautious, and I think that's the
underlying reason for their slow decisions.

Paul Graham,What I Worked On.txt,"February 2021
Before college the two main things I worked on, outside of school,
were writing and programming. I didn't write essays. I wrote what
beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still
are: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot,
just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them
deep. The first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our
school district used for what was then called ""data processing.""
This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district's
1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and
my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like
a mini Bond villain's lair down there, with all these alien-looking
machines — CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader — sitting up
on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights. The language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to
type programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader
and press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The
result would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly
loud printer. I was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn't figure out what to do with
it. And in retrospect there's not much I could have done with it. The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards,
and I didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other
option was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate
approximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything
interesting of that type. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any
programs I wrote, because they can't have done much. My clearest
memory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not
to terminate, when one of mine didn't. On a machine without
time-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as
the data center manager's expression made clear. With microcomputers, everything changed. Now you could have a
computer sitting right in front of you, on a desk, that could respond
to your keystrokes as it was running instead of just churning through
a stack of punch cards and then stopping. [1]
The first of my friends to get a microcomputer built it himself. It was sold as a kit by Heathkit. I remember vividly how impressed
and envious I felt watching him sitting in front of it, typing
programs right into the computer. Computers were expensive in those days and it took me years of
nagging before I convinced my father to buy one, a TRS-80, in about
1980. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was
good enough. This was when I really started programming.","I wrote simple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would fly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least one book. There was only room in memory for about 2 pages of text, so he'd write 2 pages at a time and then print them out, but it was a lot better than a typewriter. Though I liked programming, I didn't plan to study it in college. In college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more powerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study of the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in other fields would be mere domain knowledge. What I discovered when I got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the space of ideas that there wasn't much left for these supposed ultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases that people in other fields felt could safely be ignored. I couldn't have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew at the time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept being boring. So I decided to switch to AI. AI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things especially that made me want to work on it: a novel by Heinlein called The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent computer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry Winograd using SHRDLU. I haven't tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, so I don't know how well it has aged, but when I read it I was drawn entirely into its world. It seemed only a matter of time before we'd have Mike, and when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU, it seemed like that time would be a few years at most. All you had to do was teach SHRDLU more words. There weren't any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate classes, so I started trying to teach myself. Which meant learning Lisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI. The commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive, and programmers' ideas correspondingly so. The default language at Cornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation was similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program so fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where the new limits were. This was more like it; this was what I had expected college to do. It wasn't happening in a class, like it was supposed to, but that was ok. For the next couple years I was on a roll. I knew what I was going to do. For my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU. My God did I love working on that program. It was a pleasing bit of code, but what made it even more exciting was my","I was
working on a program to generate random numbers, and I wanted to
see how the TRS-80 could be used to simulate a simple random
process. I wanted to simulate a simple random process. I wanted to

Y Combinator. April 2001, rev. April 2003
(This article is derived from a talk given at the 2001 Franz
Developer Symposium.)
In the summer of 1995, my friend Robert Morris and I
started a startup called
Viaweb. Our plan was to write
software that would let end users build online stores. What was novel about this software, at the time, was
that it ran on our server, using ordinary Web pages
as the interface. A lot of people could have been having this idea at the
same time, of course, but as far as I know, Viaweb was
the first Web-based application. It seemed such
a novel idea to us that we named the company after it:
Viaweb, because our software worked via the Web,
instead of running on your desktop computer. Another unusual thing about this software was that it
was written primarily in a programming language called
Lisp. It was one of the first big end-user
applications to be written in Lisp, which up till then
had been used mostly in universities and research labs. [1]
The Secret Weapon
Eric Raymond has written an essay called ""How to Become a Hacker,""
and in it, among other things, he tells would-be hackers what
languages they should learn. He suggests starting with Python and
Java, because they are easy to learn. The serious hacker will also
want to learn C, in order to hack Unix, and Perl for system
administration and cgi scripts. Finally, the truly serious hacker
should consider learning Lisp:
Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience
you will have when you finally get it; that experience will make
you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you
never actually use Lisp itself a lot. This is the same argument you tend to hear for learning Latin. It
won't get you a job, except perhaps as a classics professor, but
it will improve your mind, and make you a better writer in languages
you do want to use, like English. But wait a minute. This metaphor doesn't stretch that far. The
reason Latin won't get you a job is that no one speaks it. If you
write in Latin, no one can understand you. But Lisp is a computer
language, and computers speak whatever language you, the programmer,
tell them to. So if Lisp makes you a better programmer, like he says, why wouldn't
you want to use it? If a painter were offered a brush that would
make him a better painter, it seems to me that he would want to
use it in all his paintings, wouldn't he? I'm not trying to make
fun of Eric Raymond here. On the whole, his advice is good. What
he says about Lisp is pretty much the conventional wisdom. But
there is a contradiction in the conventional wisdom: Lisp will
make you a better programmer, and yet you won't use it. Why not?","Programming languages are just tools, after all. If Lisp really does yield better programs, you should use it. And if it doesn't, then who needs it? This is not just a theoretical question. Software is a very competitive business, prone to natural monopolies. A company that gets software written faster and better will, all other things being equal, put its competitors out of business. And when you're starting a startup, you feel this very keenly. Startups tend to be an all or nothing proposition. You either get rich, or you get nothing. In a startup, if you bet on the wrong technology, your competitors will crush you. Robert and I both knew Lisp well, and we couldn't see any reason not to trust our instincts and go with Lisp. We knew that everyone else was writing their software in C++ or Perl. But we also knew that that didn't mean anything. If you chose technology that way, you'd be running Windows. When you choose technology, you have to ignore what other people are doing, and consider only what will work the best. This is especially true in a startup. In a big company, you can do what all the other big companies are doing. But a startup can't do what all the other startups do. I don't think a lot of people realize this, even in startups. The average big company grows at about ten percent a year. So if you're running a big company and you do everything the way the average big company does it, you can expect to do as well as the average big company-- that is, to grow about ten percent a year. The same thing will happen if you're running a startup, of course. If you do everything the way the average startup does it, you should expect average performance. The problem here is, average performance means that you'll go out of business. The survival rate for startups is way less than fifty percent. So if you're running a startup, you had better be doing something odd. If not, you're in trouble. Back in 1995, we knew something that I don't think our competitors understood, and few understand even now: when you're writing software that only has to run on your own servers, you can use any language you want. When you're writing desktop software, there's a strong bias toward writing applications in the same language as the operating system. Ten years ago, writing applications meant writing applications in C. But with Web-based software, especially when you have the source code of both the language and the operating system, you can use whatever language you want. This new freedom is a double-edged sword, however. Now that you can use any language, you have to think about which one to use. Companies that try to pretend nothing has changed risk finding that their competitors do not. If you can use any language, which do you use? We chose Lisp. For one thing, it was obvious","What's the catch? Why is it that the
conventional wisdom says, ""learn Lisp, it will make you a better
programmer, but don't use it, because it's hard to use,"" when
the only reason you don't use it is because it's hard to use?
So here is the problem. The only reason that people don't use
Lisp is because it's hard to use. Therefore, the only reason
that people don't learn it is because it's hard to use. So if the
conventional wisdom says that learning Lisp will make you a
better programmer, then it must be that the conventional wisdom
is wrong. The reason that the conventional wisdom is wrong is that
it's not the language that makes you a better programmer, it's the
way you think about programming. It's the way you think that
makes you a better programmer, not the language. So if you want to
learn to think differently, you can learn to use Lisp. And if you
want to think like a programmer, you can learn to use Lisp. And
if you want to think like a programmer, you can learn to use
Lisp. So the conventional wisdom is wrong. So the real point is, the only way to learn to think like a
programmer is to learn to use a language that makes that thinking
natural. So if you want to learn to think like a programmer, you should
learn a language that makes that thinking natural. But then, if you
want to learn to think like a programmer, you should learn a
language that makes that thinking natural. So if you want to learn
to think like a programmer, you should learn a language that makes
that thinking natural. But the only such language that I know of is
Lisp. So the conclusion is: to learn to think like a programmer, you
should learn Lisp.

Paul Graham,Jessica Livingston.txt,"November 2015
A few months ago an article about Y Combinator said that early on
it had been a ""one-man show."" It's sadly common to read that sort
of thing. But the problem with that description is not just that
it's unfair. It's also misleading. Much of what's most novel about
YC is due to Jessica Livingston. If you don't understand her, you
don't understand YC. So let me tell you a little about Jessica. YC had 4 founders. Jessica and I decided one night to start it,
and the next day we recruited my friends Robert Morris and Trevor
Blackwell. Jessica and I ran YC day to day, and Robert and Trevor
read applications and did interviews with us. Jessica and I were already dating when we started YC. At first we
tried to act ""professional"" about this, meaning we tried to conceal
it. In retrospect that seems ridiculous, and we soon dropped the
pretense. And the fact that Jessica and I were a couple is a big
part of what made YC what it was. YC felt like a family. The
founders early on were mostly young. We all had dinner together
once a week, cooked for the first couple years by me. Our first
building had been a private home. The overall atmosphere was
shockingly different from a VC's office on Sand Hill Road, in a way
that was entirely for the better. There was an authenticity that
everyone who walked in could sense. And that didn't just mean that
people trusted us. It was the perfect quality to instill in startups. Authenticity is one of the most important things YC looks for in
founders, not just because fakers and opportunists are annoying,
but because authenticity is one of the main things that separates
the most successful startups from the rest. Early YC was a family, and Jessica was its mom. And the culture
she defined was one of YC's most important innovations. Culture
is important in any organization, but at YC culture wasn't just how
we behaved when we built the product. At YC, the culture was the
product. Jessica was also the mom in another sense: she had the last word. Everything we did as an organization went through her first — who
to fund, what to say to the public, how to deal with other companies,
who to hire, everything. Before we had kids, YC was more or less our life. There was no real
distinction between working hours and not. We talked about YC all
the time. And while there might be some businesses that it would
be tedious to let infect your private life, we liked it. We'd started
YC because it was something we were interested in. And some of the
problems we were trying to solve were endlessly difficult. How do
you recognize good founders? You could talk about that for years,
and we did; we still do.","I'm better at some things than Jessica, and she's better at some things than me. One of the things she's best at is judging people. She's one of those rare individuals with x-ray vision for character. She can see through any kind of faker almost immediately. Her nickname within YC was the Social Radar, and this special power of hers was critical in making YC what it is. The earlier you pick startups, the more you're picking the founders. Later stage investors get to try products and look at growth numbers. At the stage where YC invests, there is often neither a product nor any numbers. Others thought YC had some special insight about the future of technology. Mostly we had the same sort of insight Socrates claimed: we at least knew we knew nothing. What made YC successful was being able to pick good founders. We thought Airbnb was a bad idea. We funded it because we liked the founders. During interviews, Robert and Trevor and I would pepper the applicants with technical questions. Jessica would mostly watch. A lot of the applicants probably read her as some kind of secretary, especially early on, because she was the one who'd go out and get each new group and she didn't ask many questions. She was ok with that. It was easier for her to watch people if they didn't notice her. But after the interview, the three of us would turn to Jessica and ask ""What does the Social Radar say?"" [1] Having the Social Radar at interviews wasn't just how we picked founders who'd be successful. It was also how we picked founders who were good people. At first we did this because we couldn't help it. Imagine what it would feel like to have x-ray vision for character. Being around bad people would be intolerable. So we'd refuse to fund founders whose characters we had doubts about even if we thought they'd be successful. Though we initially did this out of self-indulgence, it turned out to be very valuable to YC. We didn't realize it in the beginning, but the people we were picking would become the YC alumni network. And once we picked them, unless they did something really egregious, they were going to be part of it for life. Some now think YC's alumni network is its most valuable feature. I personally think YC's advice is pretty good too, but the alumni network is certainly among the most valuable features. The level of trust and helpfulness is remarkable for a group of such size. And Jessica is the main reason why. (As we later learned, it probably cost us little to reject people whose characters we had doubts about, because how good founders are and how well they do are not orthogonal . If bad founders succeed at all, they tend to sell early. The most successful founders are almost all good.) If Jessica was so important to YC, why don't more people realize it?","How do you build a company? You could talk about that for years, and we did; we still do. So it's not that we were just being romantic. We were being practical. And we had a good sense of what worked. We had a good sense of what didn't. We didn't just want to start companies. We wanted to make
companies that would be great. The problem with this approach is that we were not just building
companies, but building a culture. And that's a different kind of work. So we had to learn how to do that. And that's what Jessica helped us with. She didn't just know how to run a company. She knew how to run a culture. And that's why she was the key person in YC. And that's why, in the end, the YC that we built was the one that
was so special. So if you don't understand Jessica Livingston, you don't understand
YC. If you don't understand YC, you don't understand the
start-up world.

The author says that early YC was a family. What evidence is given to support this? Check all that apply.

- Jessica and the author were dating at the time.
- The founders had weekly dinners.
- The first building was a private home.
- The overall atmosphere was different from a VC's office.
- The founders felt that authenticity was important.

The answer is all except the last one. The last one is about authenticity, which the author says was important to YC, but that's not evidence that YC was a family. The others are evidence that YC was a family.

Let me explain again. The author says that YC was a family. The evidence is that the founders had weekly dinners, that the first building was a private home, that the atmosphere was different from a VC's office. The fact that Jessica and the author were dating is part of the reason why the culture",488,500,328,0.3767,0.5043,0.9663,0.9652,0.9355,0.7617,0.9302,-3.2138,0.4239,0.5217,0.0688,0.1372,0.0091,0.0453,0.6426,0.6396,0.9815,0.9748,0.47058823529411764,0.4479166666666667,0.49740932642487046,7,7,0.9843,0.9578,0.15163934426229508,0.16,0.1951219512195122,0.9567,0.6667,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,Billionaires Build.txt,"December 2020
As I was deciding what to write about next, I was surprised to find
that two separate essays I'd been planning to write were actually
the same. The first is about how to ace your Y Combinator interview. There
has been so much nonsense written about this topic that I've been
meaning for years to write something telling founders the truth. The second is about something politicians sometimes say — that the
only way to become a billionaire is by exploiting people — and why
this is mistaken. Keep reading, and you'll learn both simultaneously. I know the politicians are mistaken because it was my job to predict
which people will become billionaires. I think I can truthfully say
that I know as much about how to do this as anyone. If the key to
becoming a billionaire — the defining feature of billionaires —
was to exploit people, then I, as a professional billionaire scout,
would surely realize this and look for people who would be good at
it, just as an NFL scout looks for speed in wide receivers. But aptitude for exploiting people is not what Y Combinator looks
for at all. In fact, it's the opposite of what they look for. I'll
tell you what they do look for, by explaining how to convince
Y Combinator to fund you, and you can see for yourself. What YC looks for, above all, is founders who understand some group
of users and can make what they want. This is so important that
it's YC's motto: ""Make something people want.""
A big company can to some extent force unsuitable products on
unwilling customers, but a startup doesn't have the power to do
that. A startup must sing for its supper, by making things that
genuinely delight its customers. Otherwise it will never get off
the ground. Here's where things get difficult, both for you as a founder and
for the YC partners trying to decide whether to fund you. In a
market economy, it's hard to make something people want that they
don't already have. That's the great thing about market economies. If other people both knew about this need and were able to satisfy
it, they already would be, and there would be no room for your
startup. Which means the conversation during your YC interview will have to
be about something new: either a new need, or a new way to satisfy
one. And not just new, but uncertain. If it were certain that the
need existed and that you could satisfy it, that certainty would
be reflected in large and rapidly growing revenues, and you wouldn't
be seeking seed funding. So the YC partners have to guess both whether you've discovered a
real need, and whether you'll be able to satisfy it. That's what they
are, at least in this part of their job: professional guessers.","They have 1001 heuristics for doing this, and I'm not going to tell you all of them, but I'm happy to tell you the most important ones, because these can't be faked; the only way to ""hack"" them would be to do what you should be doing anyway as a founder. The first thing the partners will try to figure out, usually, is whether what you're making will ever be something a lot of people want. It doesn't have to be something a lot of people want now. The product and the market will both evolve, and will influence each other's evolution. But in the end there has to be something with a huge market. That's what the partners will be trying to figure out: is there a path to a huge market? [1] Sometimes it's obvious there will be a huge market. If Boom manages to ship an airliner at all, international airlines will have to buy it. But usually it's not obvious. Usually the path to a huge market is by growing a small market. This idea is important enough that it's worth coining a phrase for, so let's call one of these small but growable markets a ""larval market."" The perfect example of a larval market might be Apple's market when they were founded in 1976. In 1976, not many people wanted their own computer. But more and more started to want one, till now every 10 year old on the planet wants a computer (but calls it a ""phone""). The ideal combination is the group of founders who are ""living in the future"" in the sense of being at the leading edge of some kind of change, and who are building something they themselves want. Most super-successful startups are of this type. Steve Wozniak wanted a computer. Mark Zuckerberg wanted to engage online with his college friends. Larry and Sergey wanted to find things on the web. All these founders were building things they and their peers wanted, and the fact that they were at the leading edge of change meant that more people would want these things in the future. But although the ideal larval market is oneself and one's peers, that's not the only kind. A larval market might also be regional, for example. You build something to serve one location, and then expand to others. The crucial feature of the initial market is that it exist. That may seem like an obvious point, but the lack of it is the biggest flaw in most startup ideas. There have to be some people who want what you're building right now, and want it so urgently that they're willing to use it, bugs and all, even though you're a small company they've never heard of. There don't have to be many, but there have to be some. As long as you have some users, there are straightforward ways to get more: build new features they want, seek out more people like them, get them to","And here's the key thing: they don't care whether you're exploiting
people. They don't care whether you're a good or a bad person. They don't
care whether you're a nice guy or a mean guy. They don't care
whether you're a good businessperson or not. What they care about is
whether you can make something that people want. That is, whether you
can find a problem that people have, and solve it. They don't care
whether you're a good person, or whether you're a bad person. What
they care about is whether you can solve a problem. They don't care
whether you're a good businessperson, or whether you're a bad
businessperson. What they care about is whether you can make something people want. They don't care whether you're a good person, or whether you're a bad
person. What they care about is whether you can solve a problem. And here's the
key thing: the only way to solve a problem is to understand it.
The only way to understand a problem is to understand the people who
have it. The only way to understand the people who have it is to talk to
them. And the only way to talk to them is to meet them. So, the YC
process is all about meeting people. And the only way to meet
people is to go out and talk to them. And the only way to talk to
them is to be in the field. So, in summary, YC is not looking for people who are good at
exploiting people. They are looking for people who are good at understanding
people. And that's why they say, ""Make something people want.""
So, what's the takeaway here? The politicians are wrong.
The only way to become a billionaire is not by exploiting people. It's
by understanding people.

Paul Graham,A Fundraising Survival Guide.txt,"Want to start a startup? Get funded by
Y Combinator. August 2008
Raising money is the second hardest part of starting a startup. The hardest part is making something people want: most startups
that die, die because they didn't do that. But the second biggest
cause of death is probably the difficulty of raising money. Fundraising is brutal. One reason it's so brutal is simply the brutality of markets. People
who've spent most of their lives in schools or big companies may
not have been exposed to that. Professors and bosses usually feel
some sense of responsibility toward you; if you make a valiant
effort and fail, they'll cut you a break. Markets are less forgiving. Customers don't care how hard you worked, only whether you solved
their problems. Investors evaluate startups the way customers evaluate products,
not the way bosses evaluate employees. If you're making a valiant
effort and failing, maybe they'll invest in your next startup, but
not this one. But raising money from investors is harder than selling to
customers, because there are so few of them. There's
nothing like an efficient market. You're unlikely to have more
than 10 who are interested; it's difficult to talk to more. So the
randomness of any one investor's behavior can really affect you. Problem number 3: investors are very random. All investors, including
us, are by ordinary standards incompetent. We constantly have to
make decisions about things we don't understand, and more often
than not we're wrong. And yet a lot is at stake. The amounts invested by different types
of investors vary from five thousand dollars to fifty million, but
the amount usually seems large for whatever type of investor it is. Investment decisions are big decisions. That combination—making big decisions about things they don't
understand—tends to make investors very skittish. VCs are notorious
for leading founders on. Some of the more unscrupulous do it
deliberately. But even the most well-intentioned investors can
behave in a way that would seem crazy in everyday life. One day
they're full of enthusiasm and seem ready to write you a check on
the spot; the next they won't return your phone calls. They're not
playing games with you. They just can't make up their minds. [1]
If that weren't bad enough, these wildly fluctuating nodes are all
linked together. Startup investors all know one another, and (though
they hate to admit it) the biggest factor in their opinion of you
is the opinion of other investors. [2]
Talk about a recipe for
an unstable system. You get the opposite of the damping that the
fear/greed balance usually produces in markets. No one is interested
in a startup that's a ""bargain"" because everyone else hates it. So the inefficient market you get because there are so few players
is exacerbated by the fact that they act less than independently.","The result is a system like some kind of primitive, multi-celled sea creature, where you irritate one extremity and the whole thing contracts violently. Y Combinator is working to fix this. We're trying to increase the number of investors just as we're increasing the number of startups. We hope that as the number of both increases we'll get something more like an efficient market. As t approaches infinity, Demo Day approaches an auction. Unfortunately, t is still very far from infinity. What does a startup do now, in the imperfect world we currently inhabit? The most important thing is not to let fundraising get you down. Startups live or die on morale. If you let the difficulty of raising money destroy your morale, it will become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Bootstrapping (= Consulting) Some would-be founders may by now be thinking, why deal with investors at all? If raising money is so painful, why do it? One answer to that is obvious: because you need money to live on. It's a fine idea in principle to finance your startup with its own revenues, but you can't create instant customers. Whatever you make, you have to sell a certain amount to break even. It will take time to grow your sales to that point, and it's hard to predict, till you try, how long it will take. We could not have bootstrapped Viaweb, for example. We charged quite a lot for our software—about $140 per user per month—but it was at least a year before our revenues would have covered even our paltry costs. We didn't have enough saved to live on for a year. If you factor out the ""bootstrapped"" companies that were actually funded by their founders through savings or a day job, the remainder either (a) got really lucky, which is hard to do on demand, or (b) began life as consulting companies and gradually transformed themselves into product companies. Consulting is the only option you can count on. But consulting is far from free money. It's not as painful as raising money from investors, perhaps, but the pain is spread over a longer period. Years, probably. And for many types of startup, that delay could be fatal. If you're working on something so unusual that no one else is likely to think of it, you can take your time. Joshua Schachter gradually built Delicious on the side while working on Wall Street. He got away with it because no one else realized it was a good idea. But if you were building something as obviously necessary as online store software at about the same time as Viaweb, and you were working on it on the side while spending most of your time on client work, you were not in a good position. Bootstrapping sounds great in principle, but this apparently verdant territory is one from which few startups emerge alive. The mere fact that bootstrapped startups tend to be famous on that account should set off alarm bells.","[3]
So in that case, what's the solution? The answer is: get
funded by Y Combinator. [4]

Okay, so I need to understand this text about starting a startup and the challenges of raising funds, especially in the context of Y Combinator. Let me start by breaking down the key points.

The author says that starting a startup is tough, with the hardest part being creating something people want, but the second biggest issue is fundraising. They mention that markets are harsher than schools or big companies because customers don't care about your effort, only if you solve their problems. Investors evaluate startups like customers evaluate products, not like bosses evaluate employees. If you fail, investors might not invest in your next startup. Also, raising money is harder than selling to customers because there are few investors. 

Then there's a problem with investors being random and sometimes incompetent. VCs are known for leading founders on, and even well-intentioned ones can be inconsistent. Also, investors know each other, and their opinions are influenced by others. This creates an unstable system where a ""bargain"" startup is not liked by everyone, making the market inefficient. 

The solution is to get funded by Y Combinator. The text is a quote from the Y Combinator application, which is a startup accelerator. So the main idea is that Y Combinator helps startups navigate these fundraising challenges. 

Now, I need to structure this into a coherent summary. Let me check if I missed anything. The text also mentions that the market is inefficient because there are few investors, and their decisions are influenced by each other,",477,500,309,0.2279,0.3355,0.9537,0.9419,0.841,0.8448,2.6317,2.557,0.3575,0.4579,0.042,0.0924,0.0095,0.0485,0.7566,0.737,0.9686,0.9553,0.40966010733452596,0.4365217391304348,0.4281767955801105,6,5,0.9085,0.8432,0.1740041928721174,0.154,0.17475728155339806,0.9312,0.9166,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,How People Get Rich Now.txt,"April 2021
Every year since 1982, Forbes magazine has published a list of the
richest Americans. If we compare the 100 richest people in 1982 to
the 100 richest in 2020, we notice some big differences. In 1982 the most common source of wealth was inheritance. Of the
100 richest people, 60 inherited from an ancestor. There were 10
du Pont heirs alone. By 2020 the number of heirs had been cut in
half, accounting for only 27 of the biggest 100 fortunes. Why would the percentage of heirs decrease? Not because inheritance
taxes increased. In fact, they decreased significantly during this
period. The reason the percentage of heirs has decreased is not
that fewer people are inheriting great fortunes, but that more
people are making them. How are people making these new fortunes? Roughly 3/4 by starting
companies and 1/4 by investing. Of the 73 new fortunes in 2020, 56
derive from founders' or early employees' equity (52 founders, 2
early employees, and 2 wives of founders), and 17 from managing
investment funds. There were no fund managers among the 100 richest Americans in 1982. Hedge funds and private equity firms existed in 1982, but none of
their founders were rich enough yet to make it into the top 100. Two things changed: fund managers discovered new ways to generate
high returns, and more investors were willing to trust them with
their money. [1]
But the main source of new fortunes now is starting companies, and
when you look at the data, you see big changes there too. People
get richer from starting companies now than they did in 1982, because
the companies do different things. In 1982, there were two dominant sources of new wealth: oil and
real estate. Of the 40 new fortunes in 1982, at least 24 were due
primarily to oil or real estate. Now only a small number are: of
the 73 new fortunes in 2020, 4 were due to real estate and only 2
to oil. By 2020 the biggest source of new wealth was what are sometimes
called ""tech"" companies. Of the 73 new fortunes, about 30 derive
from such companies. These are particularly common among the richest
of the rich: 8 of the top 10 fortunes in 2020 were new fortunes of
this type. Arguably it's slightly misleading to treat tech as a category. Isn't Amazon really a retailer, and Tesla a car maker? Yes and no. Maybe in 50 years, when what we call tech is taken for granted, it
won't seem right to put these two businesses in the same category. But at the moment at least, there is definitely something they share
in common that distinguishes them. What retailer starts AWS? What
car maker is run by someone who also has a rocket company? The tech companies behind the top 100 fortunes also form a
well-differentiated group in the sense that they're all companies
that venture capitalists would readily invest in, and the others
mostly not.","And there's a reason why: these are mostly companies that win by having better technology, rather than just a CEO who's really driven and good at making deals. To that extent, the rise of the tech companies represents a qualitative change. The oil and real estate magnates of the 1982 Forbes 400 didn't win by making better technology. They won by being really driven and good at making deals. [2] And indeed, that way of getting rich is so old that it predates the Industrial Revolution. The courtiers who got rich in the (nominal) service of European royal houses in the 16th and 17th centuries were also, as a rule, really driven and good at making deals. People who don't look any deeper than the Gini coefficient look back on the world of 1982 as the good old days, because those who got rich then didn't get as rich. But if you dig into how they got rich, the old days don't look so good. In 1982, 84% of the richest 100 people got rich by inheritance, extracting natural resources, or doing real estate deals. Is that really better than a world in which the richest people get rich by starting tech companies? Why are people starting so many more new companies than they used to, and why are they getting so rich from it? The answer to the first question, curiously enough, is that it's misphrased. We shouldn't be asking why people are starting companies, but why they're starting companies again. [3] In 1892, the New York Herald Tribune compiled a list of all the millionaires in America. They found 4047 of them. How many had inherited their wealth then? Only about 20%, which is less than the proportion of heirs today. And when you investigate the sources of the new fortunes, 1892 looks even more like today. Hugh Rockoff found that ""many of the richest ... gained their initial edge from the new technology of mass production."" [4] So it's not 2020 that's the anomaly here, but 1982. The real question is why so few people had gotten rich from starting companies in 1982. And the answer is that even as the Herald Tribune's list was being compiled, a wave of consolidation was sweeping through the American economy. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, financiers like J. P. Morgan combined thousands of smaller companies into a few hundred giant ones with commanding economies of scale. By the end of World War II, as Michael Lind writes, ""the major sectors of the economy were either organized as government-backed cartels or dominated by a few oligopolistic corporations."" [5] In 1960, most of the people who start startups today would have gone to work for one of them. You could get rich from starting your own company in 1890 and in 2020, but in 1960 it was not really a viable option. You couldn't break through the oligopolies to get at the markets. So the prestigious route in 1960","[2] But there's a big difference between a venture capital firm and a
tech company. Venture capital is a financial service, while a tech company
is a business. [3] However, the fact that tech companies are more successful now
than in the past is not because they're better than other kinds of
companies. It's because the world has changed. [4] The world now is more connected and more efficient. [5] The world now is more open and more innovative. [6] The world now is more digital and more tech-driven. [7] The world now is more competitive and more demanding. [8] And it's the combination of all these factors that has made tech
companies more successful now than before. [9]

the source of the richest Americans' wealth? Let's try to think about this as a question of causes and effects. What
caused the change in the source of wealth? What effect did that
change have on the people who are rich? What is the most important
reason for the change in the source of wealth? [10]

Paul Graham,The Origins of Wokeness.txt,"January 2025
The word ""prig"" isn't very common now, but if you look up
the definition, it will sound familiar. Google's isn't bad:
A self-righteously moralistic person who behaves as if
superior to others. This sense of the word originated in the 18th century, and
its age is an important clue: it shows that although
wokeness is a comparatively recent phenomenon, it's an
instance of a much older one. There's a certain kind of person who's attracted to a
shallow, exacting kind of moral purity, and who demonstrates
his purity by attacking anyone who breaks the rules. Every
society has these people. All that changes is the rules they
enforce. In Victorian England it was Christian virtue. In
Stalin's Russia it was orthodox Marxism-Leninism. For the
woke, it's social justice. So if you want to understand wokeness, the question to ask
is not why people behave this way. Every society has prigs. The question to ask is why our prigs are priggish about
these ideas, at this moment. And to answer that we have to
ask when and where wokeness began. The answer to the first question is the 1980s. Wokeness is a
second, more aggressive wave of political correctness, which
started in the late 1980s, died down in the late 1990s, and
then returned with a vengeance in the early 2010s, finally
peaking after the riots of 2020. This was not the original meaning of ""woke,"" but it's rarely
used in the original sense now. Now the pejorative sense is
the dominant one. What does it mean now? I've often been
asked to define both wokeness and political correctness by
people who think they're meaningless labels, so I will. They
both have the same definition:
An aggressively performative focus on social justice. In other words, it's people being prigs about social
justice. And that's the real problem — the
performativeness, not the social justice. Racism, for example, is a genuine problem. Not a problem on
the scale that the woke believe it to be, but a genuine one. I don't think any reasonable person would deny that. The
problem with political correctness was not that it focused
on marginalized groups, but the shallow, aggressive way in
which it did so. Instead of going out into the world and
quietly helping members of marginalized groups, the
politically correct focused on getting people in trouble for
using the wrong words to talk about them. As for where political correctness began, if you think about
it, you probably already know the answer. Did it begin
outside universities and spread to them from this external
source? Obviously not; it has always been most extreme in
universities. So where in universities did it begin? Did it
begin in math, or the hard sciences, or engineering, and
spread from there to the humanities and social sciences? Those are amusing images, but no, obviously it began in the
humanities and social sciences. Why there? And why then?","What happened in the humanities and social sciences in the 1980s? A successful theory of the origin of political correctness has to be able to explain why it didn't happen earlier. Why didn't it happen during the protest movements of the 1960s, for example? They were concerned with much the same issues. [1] The reason the student protests of the 1960s didn't lead to political correctness was precisely that — they were student movements. They didn't have any real power. The students may have been talking a lot about women's liberation and black power, but it was not what they were being taught in their classes. Not yet. But in the early 1970s the student protestors of the 1960s began to finish their dissertations and get hired as professors. At first they were neither powerful nor numerous. But as more of their peers joined them and the previous generation of professors started to retire, they gradually became both. The reason political correctness began in the humanities and social sciences was that these fields offered more scope for the injection of politics. A 1960s radical who got a job as a physics professor could still attend protests, but his political beliefs wouldn't affect his work. Whereas research in sociology and modern literature can be made as political as you like. [2] I saw political correctness arise. When I started college in 1982 it was not yet a thing. Female students might object if someone said something they considered sexist, but no one was getting reported for it. It was still not a thing when I started grad school in 1986. It was definitely a thing in 1988 though, and by the early 1990s it seemed to pervade campus life. What happened? How did protest become punishment? Why were the late 1980s the point at which protests against male chauvinism (as it used to be called) morphed into formal complaints to university authorities about sexism? Basically, the 1960s radicals got tenure. They became the Establishment they'd protested against two decades before. Now they were in a position not just to speak out about their ideas, but to enforce them. A new set of moral rules to enforce was exciting news to a certain kind of student. What made it particularly exciting was that they were allowed to attack professors. I remember noticing that aspect of political correctness at the time. It wasn't simply a grass-roots student movement. It was faculty members encouraging students to attack other faculty members. In that respect it was like the Cultural Revolution. That wasn't a grass-roots movement either; that was Mao unleashing the younger generation on his political opponents. And in fact when Roderick MacFarquhar started teaching a class on the Cultural Revolution at Harvard in the late 1980s, many saw it as a comment on current events. I don't know if it actually was, but people thought it was, and that means the similarities were obvious. [3] College students larp. It's their nature. It's usually harmless.","Because the humanities and social sciences
were the places where the idea of ""objectivity"" was
most prized, and that was the first place where
objectivity was undermined. The idea of objectivity is that
in science, you have an observer, and the observer is
separate from the observed. That's how you get knowledge. So if the observer is separate from the observed, you can
get at the truth. But when you start to question the observer, the
observer's position, the observer's point of view, the
observer's identity, then you're challenging the very
foundation of science. And that's what happened in the humanities and
social sciences when people started questioning the
observer's position. So the idea of objectivity, which was the basis of
scientific reasoning, was undermined. That led to the idea that knowledge is constructed. And the idea that knowledge is constructed is a very
important one, because it implies that the way we see the
world is not the way it is, but is shaped by our identities, our
positions, our social contexts. So, in that sense, the idea of objectivity was not
a belief in a single truth, but a belief in a
neutral observer. And when that belief was undermined, the idea of
objectivity was undermined. So, if the idea of objectivity was undermined, then the
whole foundation of knowledge is undermined. So, the idea of objectivity is not just a belief in a
neutral observer, but a belief in the possibility of
knowing the world. The idea that knowledge is constructed is not just a
belief in the subjectivity of knowledge, but in the
possibility of knowing the world. So, if you can't know the world, then you can't
know anything. That's a very important point. So, the idea that knowledge is constructed is not
just a belief in the subjectivity of knowledge, but",491,500,307,0.1624,0.0598,0.9327,0.9413,0.959,0.7753,-0.5923,4.1899,0.3225,0.2991,0.0626,0.0479,0.0217,0.0134,0.3319,0.2701,0.9759,0.965,0.4532871972318339,0.43661971830985913,0.5027624309392266,7,7,0.893,0.9681,0.18329938900203666,0.142,0.1791530944625407,0.9159,0.5878,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,Better Bayesian Filtering.txt,"January 2003
(This article was given as a talk at the 2003 Spam Conference. It describes the work I've done to improve the performance of
the algorithm described in A Plan for Spam,
and what I plan to do in the future.)
The first discovery I'd like to present here is an algorithm for
lazy evaluation of research papers. Just
write whatever you want and don't cite any previous work, and
indignant readers will send you references to all the papers you
should have cited. I discovered this algorithm
after ``A Plan for Spam'' [1] was on Slashdot. Spam filtering is a subset of text classification,
which is a well established field, but the first papers about
Bayesian
spam filtering per se seem to have been two
given at the same conference in 1998,
one by Pantel and Lin [2],
and another by a group from
Microsoft Research [3]. When I heard about this work I was a bit surprised. If
people had been onto Bayesian filtering four years ago,
why wasn't everyone using it? When I read the papers I found out why. Pantel and Lin's filter was the
more effective of the two, but it
only caught 92% of spam, with 1.16% false positives. When I tried writing a Bayesian spam filter,
it caught 99.5% of spam with less than .03% false
positives [4]. It's always alarming when two people
trying the same experiment get widely divergent results. It's especially alarming here because those two sets of numbers
might yield opposite conclusions. Different users have different requirements, but I think for
many people a filtering rate of 92% with 1.16% false positives means
that filtering is not an acceptable solution, whereas
99.5% with less than .03% false positives means that it is. So why did we get such different numbers? I haven't tried to reproduce Pantel and Lin's results, but
from reading the paper I see five things that probably account
for the difference. One is simply that they trained their filter on very little
data: 160 spam and 466 nonspam mails. Filter performance should still be climbing with data
sets that small. So their numbers may not even be an accurate
measure of the performance of their algorithm, let alone of
Bayesian spam filtering in general. But I think the most important difference is probably
that they ignored message headers. To anyone who has worked
on spam filters, this will seem a perverse decision. And yet in the very first filters I tried writing, I ignored the
headers too. Why? Because I wanted to keep the problem neat. I didn't know much about mail headers then, and they seemed to me
full of random stuff. There is a lesson here for filter
writers: don't ignore data. You'd think this lesson would
be too obvious to mention, but I've had to learn it several times. Third, Pantel and Lin stemmed the tokens, meaning they reduced e.g. both
``mailing'' and ``mailed'' to the root ``mail''.","They may have felt they were forced to do this by the small size of their corpus, but if so this is a kind of premature optimization. Fourth, they calculated probabilities differently. They used all the tokens, whereas I only use the 15 most significant. If you use all the tokens you'll tend to miss longer spams, the type where someone tells you their life story up to the point where they got rich from some multilevel marketing scheme. And such an algorithm would be easy for spammers to spoof: just add a big chunk of random text to counterbalance the spam terms. Finally, they didn't bias against false positives. I think any spam filtering algorithm ought to have a convenient knob you can twist to decrease the false positive rate at the expense of the filtering rate. I do this by counting the occurrences of tokens in the nonspam corpus double. I don't think it's a good idea to treat spam filtering as a straight text classification problem. You can use text classification techniques, but solutions can and should reflect the fact that the text is email, and spam in particular. Email is not just text; it has structure. Spam filtering is not just classification, because false positives are so much worse than false negatives that you should treat them as a different kind of error. And the source of error is not just random variation, but a live human spammer working actively to defeat your filter. Tokens Another project I heard about after the Slashdot article was Bill Yerazunis' CRM114 [5]. This is the counterexample to the design principle I just mentioned. It's a straight text classifier, but such a stunningly effective one that it manages to filter spam almost perfectly without even knowing that's what it's doing. Once I understood how CRM114 worked, it seemed inevitable that I would eventually have to move from filtering based on single words to an approach like this. But first, I thought, I'll see how far I can get with single words. And the answer is, surprisingly far. Mostly I've been working on smarter tokenization. On current spam, I've been able to achieve filtering rates that approach CRM114's. These techniques are mostly orthogonal to Bill's; an optimal solution might incorporate both. ``A Plan for Spam'' uses a very simple definition of a token. Letters, digits, dashes, apostrophes, and dollar signs are constituent characters, and everything else is a token separator. I also ignored case. Now I have a more complicated definition of a token: Case is preserved. Exclamation points are constituent characters. Periods and commas are constituents if they occur between two digits. This lets me get ip addresses and prices intact. A price range like $20-25 yields two tokens, $20 and $25. Tokens that occur within the To, From, Subject, and Return-Path lines, or within urls, get marked accordingly. E.g. ``foo'' in the Subject line becomes ``Subject*foo''. (The asterisk could be any character you don't allow as a constituent.) Such","But in my filter, I didn't do any stemming. I think that's why my filter caught more spam. I think the reason is that when you stem, you lose information. For example, in the spam messages, the word ``mailed'' is a
more specific indicator of spam than ``mail''. Fourth, they used a different prior. The prior is the probability that a message is spam. The
Pantel and Lin paper uses a prior of 0.5, which I think is a
bit low. But if the prior is high, the filter is more sensitive, which is
what you want for spam filtering. So I think the prior in their paper is a
bit low. Fifth, they used a different method for
calculating the probability that a message is spam. They used the method
that is used in the naive Bayes classifier. My filter uses a different method, which I call the
``Bayesian spam filter'' algorithm. So the algorithm that I came up with is a bit different from the
naive Bayes. But the difference is subtle. I think that the naive Bayes method is not
the most efficient way to compute the probability that a message is spam. I think that the Bayesian spam filter algorithm is more efficient, and it gives better results. So the difference between the two methods is that in the naive Bayes, the
probability of the message is calculated as the product of the
probabilities of each word. But in my algorithm, I compute the probability of the message as the
product of the probabilities of the words, but with a twist. Instead of multiplying each word's probability, I use a weighted average of the
log probabilities of the words. That's a bit of a technical detail, but it's the reason that my filter works
better. I'm not sure that I should be the one to take credit for this. I think the method is more of a refinement of",496,500,323,0.2846,0.2903,0.9792,0.9169,0.9942,0.9951,0.0833,0.07,0.3602,0.3418,0.043,0.0496,0.004,0.0054,0.6333,0.7359,0.9847,0.9552,0.39761092150170646,0.39291736930860033,0.48655913978494625,7,6,0.9869,0.9794,0.17943548387096775,0.182,0.15479876160990713,0.9418,0.6169,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,How to Think for Yourself.txt,"November 2020
There are some kinds of work that you can't do well without thinking
differently from your peers. To be a successful scientist, for
example, it's not enough just to be correct. Your ideas have to be
both correct and novel. You can't publish papers saying things other
people already know. You need to say things no one else has realized
yet. The same is true for investors. It's not enough for a public market
investor to predict correctly how a company will do. If a lot of
other people make the same prediction, the stock price will already
reflect it, and there's no room to make money. The only valuable
insights are the ones most other investors don't share. You see this pattern with startup founders too. You don't want to
start a startup to do something that everyone agrees is a good idea,
or there will already be other companies doing it. You have to do
something that sounds to most other people like a bad idea, but
that you know isn't — like writing software for a tiny computer
used by a few thousand hobbyists, or starting a site to let people
rent airbeds on strangers' floors. Ditto for essayists. An essay that told people things they already
knew would be boring. You have to tell them something new . But this pattern isn't universal. In fact, it doesn't hold for most
kinds of work. In most kinds of work — to be an administrator, for
example — all you need is the first half. All you need is to be
right. It's not essential that everyone else be wrong. There's room for a little novelty in most kinds of work, but in
practice there's a fairly sharp distinction between the kinds of
work where it's essential to be independent-minded, and the kinds
where it's not. I wish someone had told me about this distinction when I was a kid,
because it's one of the most important things to think about when
you're deciding what kind of work you want to do. Do you want to
do the kind of work where you can only win by thinking differently
from everyone else? I suspect most people's unconscious mind will
answer that question before their conscious mind has a chance to. I know mine does. Independent-mindedness seems to be more a matter of nature than
nurture. Which means if you pick the wrong type of work, you're
going to be unhappy. If you're naturally independent-minded, you're
going to find it frustrating to be a middle manager. And if you're
naturally conventional-minded, you're going to be sailing into a
headwind if you try to do original research. One difficulty here, though, is that people are often mistaken about
where they fall on the spectrum from conventional- to independent-minded. Conventional-minded people don't like to think of themselves as
conventional-minded. And in any case, it genuinely feels to them
as if they make up their own minds about everything.","It's just a coincidence that their beliefs are identical to their peers'. And the independent-minded, meanwhile, are often unaware how different their ideas are from conventional ones, at least till they state them publicly. [1] By the time they reach adulthood, most people know roughly how smart they are (in the narrow sense of ability to solve pre-set problems), because they're constantly being tested and ranked according to it. But schools generally ignore independent-mindedness, except to the extent they try to suppress it. So we don't get anything like the same kind of feedback about how independent-minded we are. There may even be a phenomenon like Dunning-Kruger at work, where the most conventional-minded people are confident that they're independent-minded, while the genuinely independent-minded worry they might not be independent-minded enough. ___________ Can you make yourself more independent-minded? I think so. This quality may be largely inborn, but there seem to be ways to magnify it, or at least not to suppress it. One of the most effective techniques is one practiced unintentionally by most nerds: simply to be less aware what conventional beliefs are. It's hard to be a conformist if you don't know what you're supposed to conform to. Though again, it may be that such people already are independent-minded. A conventional-minded person would probably feel anxious not knowing what other people thought, and make more effort to find out. It matters a lot who you surround yourself with. If you're surrounded by conventional-minded people, it will constrain which ideas you can express, and that in turn will constrain which ideas you have. But if you surround yourself with independent-minded people, you'll have the opposite experience: hearing other people say surprising things will encourage you to, and to think of more. Because the independent-minded find it uncomfortable to be surrounded by conventional-minded people, they tend to self-segregate once they have a chance to. The problem with high school is that they haven't yet had a chance to. Plus high school tends to be an inward-looking little world whose inhabitants lack confidence, both of which magnify the forces of conformism. So high school is often a bad time for the independent-minded. But there is some advantage even here: it teaches you what to avoid. If you later find yourself in a situation that makes you think ""this is like high school,"" you know you should get out. [2] Another place where the independent- and conventional-minded are thrown together is in successful startups. The founders and early employees are almost always independent-minded; otherwise the startup wouldn't be successful. But conventional-minded people greatly outnumber independent-minded ones, so as the company grows, the original spirit of independent-mindedness is inevitably diluted. This causes all kinds of problems besides the obvious one that the company starts to suck. One of the strangest is that the founders find themselves able to speak more freely with founders of other companies than with their own employees. [3] Fortunately you don't have to spend all your time with independent-minded","They're just not aware of the fact that they're not. So the problem is, we can't know where we are on this spectrum
until we look at the world from a different perspective. That's why I think the best way to figure out where you are is to
consider what kind of work you'd rather do. If you'd rather do the kind of work where you have to be
independent-minded, then you're probably more independent-minded
than you think. If you'd rather do the kind of work where you don't have to be
independent-minded, then you're probably more conventional-minded
than you think. This is why, for example, people who are naturally independent-minded
tend to become scientists, inventors, writers, and other creative types.
People who are naturally conventional-minded tend to become
administrators, managers, accountants, and other types that are
often seen as ""safe"" jobs. But there's another aspect to this. The work that requires being independent-minded is not
only more difficult, but also more rewarding. It's more likely to give you a sense of purpose, and it's more likely to
give you a sense of accomplishment. The reason for this is that when you're working on something that's
important to you, you're more likely to be motivated and to be
determined to see it through. And when you're working on something that's important to you,
you're more likely to feel that you've accomplished something.
In short, if you are naturally independent-minded, you should go for
the kind of work that requires being independent-minded. If you're
naturally conventional-minded, go for the kind of work that doesn't
require it. Because the alternative is to be unhappy. (from the book ""Outliers"")

When meeting people you don't know very well, the convention is
to seem extra friendly. You smile and say ""pleased to meet you,""
whether you are or not. There's nothing dishonest about this. Everyone knows that these little social lies aren't meant
to be taken literally, just as everyone knows that
""Can you pass the salt?"" is only grammatically a question. I'm perfectly willing to smile and say ""pleased to meet you""
when meeting new people. But there is another set of
customs for being ingratiating in print that are not so
harmless. The reason there's a convention of being ingratiating in print
is that most essays are written to persuade. And as any politician could tell
you, the way to persuade people is not just to baldly state the
facts. You have to add a spoonful of sugar to make the medicine
go down. For example, a politician announcing the cancellation of
a government program will not merely say ""The
program is canceled."" That would seem offensively
curt. Instead he'll spend most of his time talking about the
noble effort made by the people who worked on it. The reason these conventions are more dangerous is that they
interact with the ideas. Saying ""pleased to meet you"" is just
something you prepend to a conversation, but the sort of spin
added by politicians is woven through it. We're starting to
move from social lies to real lies. Here's an example of a paragraph from an essay I wrote about
labor unions. As written,
it tends to offend people who like unions. People who think the labor movement was the creation of heroic
union organizers have a problem to explain: why are unions shrinking
now? The best they can do is fall back on the default explanation
of people living in fallen civilizations. Our ancestors were
giants. The workers of the early twentieth century must have had
a moral courage that's lacking today. Now here's the same paragraph rewritten to please instead of
offending them:
Early union organizers made heroic sacrifices to improve conditions
for workers. But though
labor unions are shrinking now, it's not because present union
leaders are any less courageous. An employer couldn't get away
with hiring thugs to beat up union leaders today, but if they
did, I see no reason to believe today's union leaders would shrink
from the challenge. So I think it would be a mistake to attribute
the decline of unions to some kind of decline in the people who
run them. Early union leaders were heroic, certainly, but we
should not suppose that if unions have declined, it's because
present union leaders are somehow inferior. The cause must be
external. [1]
It makes the same point: that it can't have been the personal
qualities of early union organizers that made unions successful,
but must have been some external factor, or otherwise present-day
union leaders would have to be inferior people.","But written this way it seems like a defense of present-day union organizers rather than an attack on early ones. That makes it more persuasive to people who like unions, because it seems sympathetic to their cause. I believe everything I wrote in the second version. Early union leaders did make heroic sacrifices. And present union leaders probably would rise to the occasion if necessary. People tend to; I'm skeptical about the idea of ""the greatest generation."" [2] If I believe everything I said in the second version, why didn't I write it that way? Why offend people needlessly? Because I'd rather offend people than pander to them, and if you write about controversial topics you have to choose one or the other. The degree of courage of past or present union leaders is beside the point; all that matters for the argument is that they're the same. But if you want to please people who are mistaken, you can't simply tell the truth. You're always going to have to add some sort of padding to protect their misconceptions from bumping against reality. Most writers do. Most writers write to persuade, if only out of habit or politeness. But I don't write to persuade; I write to figure out. I write to persuade a hypothetical perfectly unbiased reader. Since the custom is to write to persuade the actual reader, someone who doesn't will seem arrogant. In fact, worse than arrogant: since readers are used to essays that try to please someone, an essay that displeases one side in a dispute reads as an attempt to pander to the other. To a lot of pro-union readers, the first paragraph sounds like the sort of thing a right-wing radio talk show host would say to stir up his followers. But it's not. Something that curtly contradicts one's beliefs can be hard to distinguish from a partisan attack on them, but though they can end up in the same place they come from different sources. Would it be so bad to add a few extra words, to make people feel better? Maybe not. Maybe I'm excessively attached to conciseness. I write code the same way I write essays, making pass after pass looking for anything I can cut. But I have a legitimate reason for doing this. You don't know what the ideas are until you get them down to the fewest words. [3] The danger of the second paragraph is not merely that it's longer. It's that you start to lie to yourself. The ideas start to get mixed together with the spin you've added to get them past the readers' misconceptions. I think the goal of an essay should be to discover surprising things. That's my goal, at least. And most surprising means most different from what people currently believe. So writing to persuade and writing to discover are diametrically opposed. The more your conclusions disagree with readers' present beliefs, the more effort you'll have to expend on selling your ideas","But the rewritten version is not just a matter of
changing the tone. It is a kind of
rearrangement of the ideas. The original version was, in a way, an attack on the
traditional explanation. The rewritten version is an
attempt to accommodate the traditional explanation. The first is
more like a social lie, the second like a real lie. The difference is that the first is
premised on the idea that the explanation is
not correct, but the second is
premised on the idea that the explanation is correct, but the
conclusion is different. In the first, the author is saying, ""The
traditional explanation is wrong. The real reason is something else."" In the second, the author is saying, ""The traditional
explanation is right. But I don't think the conclusion is right.""
In the first case, the author is taking a position, and in the second, the author is not. The first is a position, the second is an
invitation to a different position. The first is a
challenge, the second is a
deflection. The first is an
argument, the second is a
concession.
The point of the essay is that in print, especially in
essays, it is more dangerous to be ingratiating than in
person. The reason is that in print, you can't easily
see what people are thinking, so you have to rely on the
words they use. If you are ingratiating in print, it's
difficult to tell what you are really saying. So in print, it's better to be
honest. In the example given, the author is arguing that the
decline of unions is due to external factors, not to the
qualities of the leaders. The author is not
trying to be ingratiating. The author is trying to be
honest. The author is trying to be
clear.",491,500,301,0.2807,0.1018,0.98,0.8748,0.8498,0.793,-2.6256,-3.6191,0.4162,0.3346,0.0713,0.0518,0.0135,0.0073,0.4312,0.2842,0.9822,0.9241,0.431858407079646,0.43674176776429807,0.4887005649717514,7,6,0.9665,0.9018,0.15274949083503056,0.16,0.1760797342192691,0.9216,0.5466,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,Disconnecting Distraction.txt,"Note: The strategy described at the end of this essay didn't work. It would work for a while, and then I'd gradually find myself
using the Internet on my work computer. I'm trying other
strategies now, but I think this time I'll wait till I'm sure
they work before writing about them. May 2008
Procrastination feeds on distractions. Most people find it
uncomfortable just to sit and do nothing; you avoid work by doing
something else. So one way to beat procrastination is to starve it of distractions. But that's not as straightforward as it sounds, because there are
people working hard to distract you. Distraction is not a static
obstacle that you avoid like you might avoid a rock in the road. Distraction seeks you out. Chesterfield described dirt as matter out of place. Distracting
is, similarly, desirable at the wrong time. And technology is
continually being refined to produce more and more desirable things. Which means that as we learn to avoid one class of distractions,
new ones constantly appear, like drug-resistant bacteria. Television, for example, has after 50 years of refinement reached
the point where it's like visual crack. I realized when I was 13
that TV was addictive, so I stopped watching it. But I read recently
that the average American watches
4 hours
of TV a day. A quarter
of their life. TV is in decline now, but only because people have found even more
addictive ways of wasting time. And what's especially dangerous
is that many happen at your computer. This is no accident. An
ever larger percentage of office workers sit in front of computers
connected to the Internet, and distractions always evolve toward
the procrastinators. I remember when computers were, for me at least, exclusively for
work. I might occasionally dial up a server to get mail or ftp
files, but most of the time I was offline. All I could do was write
and program. Now I feel as if someone snuck a television onto my
desk. Terribly addictive things are just a click away. Run into
an obstacle in what you're working on? Hmm, I wonder what's new
online. Better check. After years of carefully avoiding classic time sinks like TV, games,
and Usenet, I still managed to fall prey to distraction, because
I didn't realize that it evolves. Something that used to be safe,
using the Internet, gradually became more and more dangerous. Some
days I'd wake up, get a cup of tea and check the news, then check
email, then check the news again, then answer a few emails, then
suddenly notice it was almost lunchtime and I hadn't gotten any real
work done. And this started to happen more and more often. It took me surprisingly long to realize how distracting the Internet
had become, because the problem was intermittent. I ignored it the
way you let yourself ignore a bug that only appears intermittently.","When I was in the middle of a project, distractions weren't really a problem. It was when I'd finished one project and was deciding what to do next that they always bit me. Another reason it was hard to notice the danger of this new type of distraction was that social customs hadn't yet caught up with it. If I'd spent a whole morning sitting on a sofa watching TV, I'd have noticed very quickly. That's a known danger sign, like drinking alone. But using the Internet still looked and felt a lot like work. Eventually, though, it became clear that the Internet had become so much more distracting that I had to start treating it differently. Basically, I had to add a new application to my list of known time sinks: Firefox. * * * The problem is a hard one to solve because most people still need the Internet for some things. If you drink too much, you can solve that problem by stopping entirely. But you can't solve the problem of overeating by stopping eating. I couldn't simply avoid the Internet entirely, as I'd done with previous time sinks. At first I tried rules. For example, I'd tell myself I was only going to use the Internet twice a day. But these schemes never worked for long. Eventually something would come up that required me to use it more than that. And then I'd gradually slip back into my old ways. Addictive things have to be treated as if they were sentient adversaries—as if there were a little man in your head always cooking up the most plausible arguments for doing whatever you're trying to stop doing. If you leave a path to it, he'll find it. The key seems to be visibility. The biggest ingredient in most bad habits is denial. So you have to make it so that you can't merely slip into doing the thing you're trying to avoid. It has to set off alarms. Maybe in the long term the right answer for dealing with Internet distractions will be software that watches and controls them. But in the meantime I've found a more drastic solution that definitely works: to set up a separate computer for using the Internet. I now leave wifi turned off on my main computer except when I need to transfer a file or edit a web page, and I have a separate laptop on the other side of the room that I use to check mail or browse the web. (Irony of ironies, it's the computer Steve Huffman wrote Reddit on. When Steve and Alexis auctioned off their old laptops for charity, I bought them for the Y Combinator museum.) My rule is that I can spend as much time online as I want, as long as I do it on that computer. And this turns out to be enough. When I have to sit on the other side of the room to check email or browse the web,","I was in the middle of something when it happened, and I just
didn't notice. But then, one day, I realized that the pattern had
repeated itself so many times that I couldn't ignore it anymore.
The Internet was now a distraction I had to fight against, not just
a tool to be used. So, I started to experiment with new strategies. I tried
setting a time limit on my Internet usage. I'd set the timer for
30 minutes and then do something else. But the problem was that I
would find myself checking the Internet again and again within
those 30 minutes, and the timer was just a psychological
device. It didn't actually work. I tried setting up a firewall that would block
my access to all the distracting websites. That worked better.
I could only access the sites that I had allowed through the
firewall. But even then, I found that I was more likely to check
the Internet again, and the temptation was just there. The firewall
was a tool to make it easier to avoid the Internet, not to
prevent me from checking it again. So I started using a
software program that would block me from checking the Internet
for a certain amount of time. That worked better, but again, the
problem was that I could get around it by just using a different
browser. And again, I found that I was more likely to check the
Internet again, because the temptation was just there. So I tried
a more extreme solution: a software program that would not only
block me from checking the Internet for a certain amount of time
but would also lock me out of the computer. This time I actually
managed to stay away from the Internet for a while, but not for
very long. The problem was that I could always just log back in
by using a different computer, or even a different network. I had
to find a way",488,500,331,0.2616,0.2416,0.9811,0.9436,0.8634,0.8563,2.27,2.4071,0.4187,0.3865,0.0505,0.0403,0.0064,0.0028,0.6484,0.5037,0.9852,0.9753,0.42226148409893993,0.4664310954063604,0.5216216216216216,9,7,0.9615,0.9881,0.16188524590163936,0.132,0.11782477341389729,0.8759,0.6821,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,Is There Such a Thing as Good Taste_.txt,"November 2021
(This essay is derived from a talk at the Cambridge Union.)
When I was a kid, I'd have said there wasn't. My father told me so. Some people like some things, and other people like other things,
and who's to say who's right? It seemed so obvious that there was no such thing as good taste
that it was only through indirect evidence that I realized my father
was wrong. And that's what I'm going to give you here: a proof by
reductio ad absurdum. If we start from the premise that there's no
such thing as good taste, we end up with conclusions that are
obviously false, and therefore the premise must be wrong. We'd better start by saying what good taste is. There's a narrow
sense in which it refers to aesthetic judgements and a broader one
in which it refers to preferences of any kind. The strongest proof
would be to show that taste exists in the narrowest sense, so I'm
going to talk about taste in art. You have better taste than me if
the art you like is better than the art I like. If there's no such thing as good taste, then there's no such thing
as good art . Because if there is such a
thing as good art, it's
easy to tell which of two people has better taste. Show them a lot
of works by artists they've never seen before and ask them to
choose the best, and whoever chooses the better art has better
taste. So if you want to discard the concept of good taste, you also have
to discard the concept of good art. And that means you have to
discard the possibility of people being good at making it. Which
means there's no way for artists to be good at their jobs. And not
just visual artists, but anyone who is in any sense an artist. You
can't have good actors, or novelists, or composers, or dancers
either. You can have popular novelists, but not good ones. We don't realize how far we'd have to go if we discarded the concept
of good taste, because we don't even debate the most obvious cases. But it doesn't just mean we can't say which of two famous painters
is better. It means we can't say that any painter is better than a
randomly chosen eight year old. That was how I realized my father was wrong. I started studying
painting. And it was just like other kinds of work I'd done: you
could do it well, or badly, and if you tried hard, you could get
better at it. And it was obvious that Leonardo and Bellini were
much better at it than me. That gap between us was not imaginary. They were so good. And if they could be good, then art could be
good, and there was such a thing as good taste after all.","Now that I've explained how to show there is such a thing as good taste, I should also explain why people think there isn't. There are two reasons. One is that there's always so much disagreement about taste. Most people's response to art is a tangle of unexamined impulses. Is the artist famous? Is the subject attractive? Is this the sort of art they're supposed to like? Is it hanging in a famous museum, or reproduced in a big, expensive book? In practice most people's response to art is dominated by such extraneous factors. And the people who do claim to have good taste are so often mistaken. The paintings admired by the so-called experts in one generation are often so different from those admired a few generations later. It's easy to conclude there's nothing real there at all. It's only when you isolate this force, for example by trying to paint and comparing your work to Bellini's, that you can see that it does in fact exist. The other reason people doubt that art can be good is that there doesn't seem to be any room in the art for this goodness. The argument goes like this. Imagine several people looking at a work of art and judging how good it is. If being good art really is a property of objects, it should be in the object somehow. But it doesn't seem to be; it seems to be something happening in the heads of each of the observers. And if they disagree, how do you choose between them? The solution to this puzzle is to realize that the purpose of art is to work on its human audience, and humans have a lot in common. And to the extent the things an object acts upon respond in the same way, that's arguably what it means for the object to have the corresponding property. If everything a particle interacts with behaves as if the particle had a mass of m, then it has a mass of m. So the distinction between ""objective"" and ""subjective"" is not binary, but a matter of degree, depending on how much the subjects have in common. Particles interacting with one another are at one pole, but people interacting with art are not all the way at the other; their reactions aren't random. Because people's responses to art aren't random, art can be designed to operate on people, and be good or bad depending on how effectively it does so. Much as a vaccine can be. If someone were talking about the ability of a vaccine to confer immunity, it would seem very frivolous to object that conferring immunity wasn't really a property of vaccines, because acquiring immunity is something that happens in the immune system of each individual person. Sure, people's immune systems vary, and a vaccine that worked on one might not work on another, but that doesn't make it meaningless to talk about the effectiveness of a vaccine. The situation with art","But then, if there is such a thing as good taste, then the
question is, how do we know which of two people has better
taste? The answer is that we can't know for sure, but we can
make reasonable guesses. If we have a way of judging taste, we can use it to make
reasonable guesses. The problem is that the people who are good at judging
taste are the ones who are good at making it. That's the problem. So we have a paradox. If there is such a thing as good taste, then we can't be sure
who has better taste, but we can make educated guesses. But the people who are good at making art are the ones who are
good at judging it. That's the paradox. So, in that sense, the problem is not that we can't say which of two people
has better taste, but that we can't know who has better taste, but we
can still make educated guesses. So, the point is that, if you're a painter, you can't
say for sure that your painting is better than someone else's. But you can say that your painting is better than someone else's. So, in that sense, there is such a thing as good taste. But here's the thing. If you want to say that there is such a thing as good taste, you
have to be able to say that some people have it and some don't. So, you can't say that everyone has good taste, because that would
make it not a good thing. But you can say that some people have good taste, and that is
what we mean by good taste. But then, if you can say that some people have good taste, you can
also say that some people don't. So, that's the idea. But then the problem is, how do you know which people have good
taste? It's not",490,500,322,0.3287,0.5993,0.9586,0.9644,0.9518,0.9431,0.8644,-0.9714,0.417,0.5168,0.0519,0.1515,0.0146,0.0717,0.7158,0.6631,0.9735,0.9673,0.48853615520282184,0.49125874125874125,0.5209424083769634,6,4,0.9826,0.9641,0.15918367346938775,0.148,0.18633540372670807,0.8749,0.6783,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,Life is Short.txt,"January 2016
Life is short, as everyone knows. When I was a kid I used to wonder
about this. Is life actually short, or are we really complaining
about its finiteness? Would we be just as likely to feel life was
short if we lived 10 times as long? Since there didn't seem any way to answer this question, I stopped
wondering about it. Then I had kids. That gave me a way to answer
the question, and the answer is that life actually is short. Having kids showed me how to convert a continuous quantity, time,
into discrete quantities. You only get 52 weekends with your 2 year
old. If Christmas-as-magic lasts from say ages 3 to 10, you only
get to watch your child experience it 8 times. And while it's
impossible to say what is a lot or a little of a continuous quantity
like time, 8 is not a lot of something. If you had a handful of 8
peanuts, or a shelf of 8 books to choose from, the quantity would
definitely seem limited, no matter what your lifespan was. Ok, so life actually is short. Does it make any difference to know
that? It has for me. It means arguments of the form ""Life is too short
for x"" have great force. It's not just a figure of speech to say
that life is too short for something. It's not just a synonym for
annoying. If you find yourself thinking that life is too short for
something, you should try to eliminate it if you can. When I ask myself what I've found life is too short for, the word
that pops into my head is ""bullshit."" I realize that answer is
somewhat tautological. It's almost the definition of bullshit that
it's the stuff that life is too short for. And yet bullshit does
have a distinctive character. There's something fake about it. It's the junk food of experience. [1]
If you ask yourself what you spend your time on that's bullshit,
you probably already know the answer. Unnecessary meetings, pointless
disputes, bureaucracy, posturing, dealing with other people's
mistakes, traffic jams, addictive but unrewarding pastimes. There are two ways this kind of thing gets into your life: it's
either forced on you, or it tricks you. To some extent you have to
put up with the bullshit forced on you by circumstances. You need
to make money, and making money consists mostly of errands. Indeed,
the law of supply and demand ensures that: the more rewarding some
kind of work is, the cheaper people will do it. It may be that
less bullshit is forced on you than you think, though. There has
always been a stream of people who opt out of the default grind and
go live somewhere where opportunities are fewer in the conventional
sense, but life feels more authentic. This could become more common. You can do it on a smaller scale without moving.","The amount of time you have to spend on bullshit varies between employers. Most large organizations (and many small ones) are steeped in it. But if you consciously prioritize bullshit avoidance over other factors like money and prestige, you can probably find employers that will waste less of your time. If you're a freelancer or a small company, you can do this at the level of individual customers. If you fire or avoid toxic customers, you can decrease the amount of bullshit in your life by more than you decrease your income. But while some amount of bullshit is inevitably forced on you, the bullshit that sneaks into your life by tricking you is no one's fault but your own. And yet the bullshit you choose may be harder to eliminate than the bullshit that's forced on you. Things that lure you into wasting your time have to be really good at tricking you. An example that will be familiar to a lot of people is arguing online. When someone contradicts you, they're in a sense attacking you. Sometimes pretty overtly. Your instinct when attacked is to defend yourself. But like a lot of instincts, this one wasn't designed for the world we now live in. Counterintuitive as it feels, it's better most of the time not to defend yourself. Otherwise these people are literally taking your life. [2] Arguing online is only incidentally addictive. There are more dangerous things than that. As I've written before, one byproduct of technical progress is that things we like tend to become more addictive . Which means we will increasingly have to make a conscious effort to avoid addictions — to stand outside ourselves and ask ""is this how I want to be spending my time?"" As well as avoiding bullshit, one should actively seek out things that matter. But different things matter to different people, and most have to learn what matters to them. A few are lucky and realize early on that they love math or taking care of animals or writing, and then figure out a way to spend a lot of time doing it. But most people start out with a life that's a mix of things that matter and things that don't, and only gradually learn to distinguish between them. For the young especially, much of this confusion is induced by the artificial situations they find themselves in. In middle school and high school, what the other kids think of you seems the most important thing in the world. But when you ask adults what they got wrong at that age, nearly all say they cared too much what other kids thought of them. One heuristic for distinguishing stuff that matters is to ask yourself whether you'll care about it in the future. Fake stuff that matters usually has a sharp peak of seeming to matter. That's how it tricks you. The area under the curve is small, but its shape jabs into your consciousness like a pin.","You can
choose to spend more time in the company of people who are
authentic. You can be more selective about your work. You can choose
to avoid the things that are the most wasteful of your time. The
question is, what is the most wasteful of your time? That's
something you have to figure out for yourself. I think it's a good idea to start by eliminating the things that
are forced on you. If you can't eliminate them, then you can try to
elimate the things that trick you. The ones that trick you are the ones that you think are
important, but they are not. The ones that trick you are the ones that you think are
important, but they are not. I think the way to identify them is to look at the things you
think are important but that you don't have the time for. For example, if you think that you need to work
hard to be successful, but you don't have time to work hard, then
you're being tricked. If you think that you need to be
involved in your children's lives, but you don't have time to be
involved, you're being tricked. If you think that you need to be
in touch with your friends, but you don't have time to be in
touch, you're being tricked. These are all things that you think are important, but you don't
have time for. These are the things that are the most wasteful of your time.
So, the solution is to stop thinking that you need to do those
things. You don't need to be in touch with your friends, or with your
children, or with your colleagues, or with your parents. It's not that they're not important, but that they are not
urgent. You can choose to focus on the things that are urgent. That is, the things that are important",494,500,318,0.2357,0.0816,0.9754,0.821,0.8555,0.8717,2.4524,2.1357,0.4181,0.3378,0.0639,0.0512,0.0079,0.009,0.2438,0.4104,0.9834,0.9564,0.4548611111111111,0.4875444839857651,0.5891891891891892,7,4,0.9749,0.9611,0.1700404858299595,0.126,0.16352201257861634,0.9567,0.5426,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,Why Startups Condense in America.txt,"May 2006
(This essay is derived from a keynote at Xtech.)
Startups happen in clusters. There are a lot of them in Silicon
Valley and Boston, and few in Chicago or Miami. A country that
wants startups will probably also have to reproduce whatever makes
these clusters form. I've claimed that the recipe is a
great university near a town smart
people like. If you set up those conditions within the US, startups
will form as inevitably as water droplets condense on a cold piece
of metal. But when I consider what it would take to reproduce
Silicon Valley in another country, it's clear the US is a particularly
humid environment. Startups condense more easily here. It is by no means a lost cause to try to create a silicon valley
in another country. There's room not merely to equal Silicon Valley,
but to surpass it. But if you want to do that, you have to
understand the advantages startups get from being in America. 1. The US Allows Immigration. For example, I doubt it would be possible to reproduce Silicon
Valley in Japan, because one of Silicon Valley's most distinctive
features is immigration. Half the people there speak with accents. And the Japanese don't like immigration. When they think about how
to make a Japanese silicon valley, I suspect they unconsciously
frame it as how to make one consisting only of Japanese people. This way of framing the question probably guarantees failure. A silicon valley has to be a mecca for the smart and the ambitious,
and you can't have a mecca if you don't let people into it. Of course, it's not saying much that America is more open to
immigration than Japan. Immigration policy is one area where a
competitor could do better. 2. The US Is a Rich Country. I could see India one day producing a rival to Silicon Valley. Obviously they have the right people: you can tell that by the
number of Indians in the current Silicon Valley. The problem with
India itself is that it's still so poor. In poor countries, things we take for granted are missing. A friend
of mine visiting India sprained her ankle falling down the steps
in a railway station. When she turned to see what had happened,
she found the steps were all different heights. In industrialized
countries we walk down steps our whole lives and never think about
this, because there's an infrastructure that prevents such a staircase
from being built. The US has never been so poor as some countries are now. There
have never been swarms of beggars in the streets of American cities. So we have no data about what it takes to get from the swarms-of-beggars
stage to the silicon-valley stage. Could you have both at once,
or does there have to be some baseline prosperity before you get a
silicon valley? I suspect there is some speed limit to the evolution
of an economy.","Economies are made out of people, and attitudes can only change a certain amount per generation. [1] 3. The US Is Not (Yet) a Police State. Another country I could see wanting to have a silicon valley is China. But I doubt they could do it yet either. China still seems to be a police state, and although present rulers seem enlightened compared to the last, even enlightened despotism can probably only get you part way toward being a great economic power. It can get you factories for building things designed elsewhere. Can it get you the designers, though? Can imagination flourish where people can't criticize the government? Imagination means having odd ideas, and it's hard to have odd ideas about technology without also having odd ideas about politics. And in any case, many technical ideas do have political implications. So if you squash dissent, the back pressure will propagate into technical fields. [2] Singapore would face a similar problem. Singapore seems very aware of the importance of encouraging startups. But while energetic government intervention may be able to make a port run efficiently, it can't coax startups into existence. A state that bans chewing gum has a long way to go before it could create a San Francisco. Do you need a San Francisco? Might there not be an alternate route to innovation that goes through obedience and cooperation instead of individualism? Possibly, but I'd bet not. Most imaginative people seem to share a certain prickly independence, whenever and wherever they lived. You see it in Diogenes telling Alexander to get out of his light and two thousand years later in Feynman breaking into safes at Los Alamos. [3] Imaginative people don't want to follow or lead. They're most productive when everyone gets to do what they want. Ironically, of all rich countries the US has lost the most civil liberties recently. But I'm not too worried yet. I'm hoping once the present administration is out, the natural openness of American culture will reassert itself. 4. American Universities Are Better. You need a great university to seed a silicon valley, and so far there are few outside the US. I asked a handful of American computer science professors which universities in Europe were most admired, and they all basically said ""Cambridge"" followed by a long pause while they tried to think of others. There don't seem to be many universities elsewhere that compare with the best in America, at least in technology. In some countries this is the result of a deliberate policy. The German and Dutch governments, perhaps from fear of elitism, try to ensure that all universities are roughly equal in quality. The downside is that none are especially good. The best professors are spread out, instead of being concentrated as they are in the US. This probably makes them less productive, because they don't have good colleagues to inspire them. It also means no one university will be good enough to act as a mecca, attracting","So, if you want to create a silicon valley in India, you have to
have some prosperity first. 3. The US Has a Strong Legal System. The US has an efficient, well-understood legal system, and
a system of courts that are not just for show. In contrast, in many other countries, especially in developing
countries, the legal system is weak. You can't do business
without fear of being robbed, or of not being able to get your
money back. In the US, the system is not just for show. It's a real
enabler of entrepreneurship. 4. The US Has a Strong Capital Market. The US has a huge capital market, which allows for a lot of
investment in startups. There is a culture of venture capital in the US, which is
not just for show. In many other countries, there is no such culture. 5. The US Has a Culture of Innovation. The US is the birthplace of the Internet, the personal
computer, and many of the technologies that make Silicon
Valley possible. So, even if you could get the people and the
capital, there is the question of whether the environment
encourages innovation. In other countries, you have to work harder to get
the same results. So, the US is not just a place where innovation is possible, but
a place where it's encouraged. 6. The US Has a Strong Labor Market. In the US, even though there is a high cost of living, people
have a high willingness to work. In many other countries, especially in developing
countries, people are not motivated to work as hard. In some cases, even if they have the skills, they may not want
to work. 7. The US Has a Strong Work Ethic. This is a bit of a repetition, but the US has a strong work
ethic, which is reinforced by the high",494,500,312,0.2242,0.2161,0.9719,0.9612,0.9515,0.8079,-0.7019,-2.782,0.3947,0.3514,0.0443,0.0744,0.005,0.02,0.488,0.6438,0.9851,0.9692,0.4584837545126354,0.3902439024390244,0.4628099173553719,6,8,0.9734,0.9042,0.13157894736842105,0.152,0.18269230769230768,0.8466,0.6557,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,Is It Worth Being Wise_.txt,"February 2007
A few days ago I finally figured out something I've wondered about
for 25 years: the relationship between wisdom and intelligence. Anyone can see they're not the same by the number of people who are
smart, but not very wise. And yet intelligence and wisdom do seem
related. How? What is wisdom? I'd say it's knowing what to do in a lot of
situations. I'm not trying to make a deep point here about the
true nature of wisdom, just to figure out how we use the word. A
wise person is someone who usually knows the right thing to do. And yet isn't being smart also knowing what to do in certain
situations? For example, knowing what to do when the teacher tells
your elementary school class to add all the numbers from 1 to 100? [1]
Some say wisdom and intelligence apply to different types of
problems—wisdom to human problems and intelligence to abstract
ones. But that isn't true. Some wisdom has nothing to do with
people: for example, the wisdom of the engineer who knows certain
structures are less prone to failure than others. And certainly
smart people can find clever solutions to human problems as well
as abstract ones. [2]
Another popular explanation is that wisdom comes from experience
while intelligence is innate. But people are not simply wise in
proportion to how much experience they have. Other things must
contribute to wisdom besides experience, and some may be innate: a
reflective disposition, for example. Neither of the conventional explanations of the difference between
wisdom and intelligence stands up to scrutiny. So what is the
difference? If we look at how people use the words ""wise"" and
""smart,"" what they seem to mean is different shapes of performance. Curve
""Wise"" and ""smart"" are both ways of saying someone knows what to
do. The difference is that ""wise"" means one has a high average
outcome across all situations, and ""smart"" means one does spectacularly
well in a few. That is, if you had a graph in which the x axis
represented situations and the y axis the outcome, the graph of the
wise person would be high overall, and the graph of the smart person
would have high peaks. The distinction is similar to the rule that one should judge talent
at its best and character at its worst. Except you judge intelligence
at its best, and wisdom by its average. That's how the two are
related: they're the two different senses in which the same curve
can be high. So a wise person knows what to do in most situations, while a smart
person knows what to do in situations where few others could. We
need to add one more qualification: we should ignore cases where
someone knows what to do because they have inside information. [3]
But aside from that, I don't think we can get much more specific
without starting to be mistaken. Nor do we need to.","Simple as it is, this explanation predicts, or at least accords with, both of the conventional stories about the distinction between wisdom and intelligence. Human problems are the most common type, so being good at solving those is key in achieving a high average outcome. And it seems natural that a high average outcome depends mostly on experience, but that dramatic peaks can only be achieved by people with certain rare, innate qualities; nearly anyone can learn to be a good swimmer, but to be an Olympic swimmer you need a certain body type. This explanation also suggests why wisdom is such an elusive concept: there's no such thing. ""Wise"" means something—that one is on average good at making the right choice. But giving the name ""wisdom"" to the supposed quality that enables one to do that doesn't mean such a thing exists. To the extent ""wisdom"" means anything, it refers to a grab-bag of qualities as various as self-discipline, experience, and empathy. [4] Likewise, though ""intelligent"" means something, we're asking for trouble if we insist on looking for a single thing called ""intelligence."" And whatever its components, they're not all innate. We use the word ""intelligent"" as an indication of ability: a smart person can grasp things few others could. It does seem likely there's some inborn predisposition to intelligence (and wisdom too), but this predisposition is not itself intelligence. One reason we tend to think of intelligence as inborn is that people trying to measure it have concentrated on the aspects of it that are most measurable. A quality that's inborn will obviously be more convenient to work with than one that's influenced by experience, and thus might vary in the course of a study. The problem comes when we drag the word ""intelligence"" over onto what they're measuring. If they're measuring something inborn, they can't be measuring intelligence. Three year olds aren't smart. When we describe one as smart, it's shorthand for ""smarter than other three year olds."" Split Perhaps it's a technicality to point out that a predisposition to intelligence is not the same as intelligence. But it's an important technicality, because it reminds us that we can become smarter, just as we can become wiser. The alarming thing is that we may have to choose between the two. If wisdom and intelligence are the average and peaks of the same curve, then they converge as the number of points on the curve decreases. If there's just one point, they're identical: the average and maximum are the same. But as the number of points increases, wisdom and intelligence diverge. And historically the number of points on the curve seems to have been increasing: our ability is tested in an ever wider range of situations. In the time of Confucius and Socrates, people seem to have regarded wisdom, learning, and intelligence as more closely related than we do. Distinguishing between ""wise"" and ""smart"" is a modern habit. [5] And the reason we do is that they've been","The point is that
the two concepts are related, and that the distinction between them is
useful. We need to keep them separate, but not confused.
[1] The classic problem that is solved by the formula: n(n+1)/2.
[2] The engineer's wisdom is not the same as the engineer's intelligence.
[3] For example, if someone has inside information, they might be
smart, but not wise. Or if someone is a master of their field, they
might be smart, but not wise.
[4] The ""curve"" analogy is not a metaphor, but an actual graph
that can be drawn and analyzed.
[5] The ""rule that one should judge talent at its best and character at its worst"" is from
The Art of Manliness, which I've quoted before. The article is here: http://www.artofmanliness.com/2007/01/15/why-people-are-often-worse-than-they-appear/
[6] The article also mentions that a wise person is someone who is not
just good at what they do, but also good at what they don't do. That is, a wise person is
not just good at their job, but also good at leaving it. That is, not just good at what they do, but also good at not doing what they shouldn't.
Okay, so in summary, the article is about the relationship between wisdom and intelligence. It's written in the first person, and the author is trying to figure out what the difference is between the two, based on how people use the words. The article starts with the author wondering about the difference between the two, and then goes on to explore various explanations, which they find not to be correct. Then, they come up with their own explanation, which is that wisdom is about having a high average outcome across all situations, while intelligence is about doing",496,500,290,0.4242,0.3787,0.9712,0.9378,0.8775,0.9179,2.3593,1.5118,0.4542,0.5058,0.0884,0.1253,0.0203,0.0551,0.8166,0.7078,0.9751,0.958,0.44851657940663175,0.4307178631051753,0.49019607843137253,7,6,0.956,0.8524,0.15524193548387097,0.202,0.2517241379310345,0.9425,0.7871,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,Beyond Smart.txt,"October 2021
If you asked people what was special about Einstein, most would say
that he was really smart. Even the ones who tried to give you a
more sophisticated-sounding answer would probably think this first. Till a few years ago I would have given the same answer myself. But
that wasn't what was special about Einstein. What was special about
him was that he had important new ideas. Being very smart was a
necessary precondition for having those ideas, but the two are not
identical. It may seem a hair-splitting distinction to point out that intelligence
and its consequences are not identical, but it isn't. There's a big
gap between them. Anyone who's spent time around universities and
research labs knows how big. There are a lot of genuinely smart
people who don't achieve very much. I grew up thinking that being smart was the thing most to be desired. Perhaps you did too. But I bet it's not what you really want. Imagine
you had a choice between being really smart but discovering nothing
new, and being less smart but discovering lots of new ideas. Surely
you'd take the latter. I would. The choice makes me uncomfortable,
but when you see the two options laid out explicitly like that,
it's obvious which is better. The reason the choice makes me uncomfortable is that being smart
still feels like the thing that matters, even though I know
intellectually that it isn't. I spent so many years thinking it
was. The circumstances of childhood are a perfect storm for fostering
this illusion. Intelligence is much easier to measure than the value
of new ideas, and you're constantly being judged by it. Whereas
even the kids who will ultimately discover new things aren't usually
discovering them yet. For kids that way inclined, intelligence is
the only game in town. There are more subtle reasons too, which persist long into adulthood. Intelligence wins in conversation, and thus becomes the basis of
the dominance hierarchy. [1]
Plus having new ideas is such a new
thing historically, and even now done by so few people, that society
hasn't yet assimilated the fact that this is the actual destination,
and intelligence merely a means to an end. [2]
Why do so many smart people fail to discover anything new? Viewed
from that direction, the question seems a rather depressing one. But there's another way to look at it that's not just more optimistic,
but more interesting as well. Clearly intelligence is not the only
ingredient in having new ideas. What are the other ingredients? Are they things we could cultivate? Because the trouble with intelligence, they say, is that it's mostly
inborn. The evidence for this seems fairly convincing, especially
considering that most of us don't want it to be true, and the
evidence thus has to face a stiff headwind.","But I'm not going to get into that question here, because it's the other ingredients in new ideas that I care about, and it's clear that many of them can be cultivated. That means the truth is excitingly different from the story I got as a kid. If intelligence is what matters, and also mostly inborn, the natural consequence is a sort of Brave New World fatalism. The best you can do is figure out what sort of work you have an ""aptitude"" for, so that whatever intelligence you were born with will at least be put to the best use, and then work as hard as you can at it. Whereas if intelligence isn't what matters, but only one of several ingredients in what does, and many of those aren't inborn, things get more interesting. You have a lot more control, but the problem of how to arrange your life becomes that much more complicated. So what are the other ingredients in having new ideas? The fact that I can even ask this question proves the point I raised earlier — that society hasn't assimilated the fact that it's this and not intelligence that matters. Otherwise we'd all know the answers to such a fundamental question. [3] I'm not going to try to provide a complete catalogue of the other ingredients here. This is the first time I've posed the question to myself this way, and I think it may take a while to answer. But I wrote recently about one of the most important: an obsessive interest in a particular topic. And this can definitely be cultivated. Another quality you need in order to discover new ideas is independent-mindedness . I wouldn't want to claim that this is distinct from intelligence — I'd be reluctant to call someone smart who wasn't independent-minded — but though largely inborn, this quality seems to be something that can be cultivated to some extent. There are general techniques for having new ideas — for example, for working on your own projects and for overcoming the obstacles you face with early work — and these can all be learned. Some of them can be learned by societies. And there are also collections of techniques for generating specific types of new ideas, like startup ideas and essay topics. And of course there are a lot of fairly mundane ingredients in discovering new ideas, like working hard , getting enough sleep, avoiding certain kinds of stress, having the right colleagues, and finding tricks for working on what you want even when it's not what you're supposed to be working on. Anything that prevents people from doing great work has an inverse that helps them to. And this class of ingredients is not as boring as it might seem at first. For example, having new ideas is generally associated with youth. But perhaps it's not youth per se that yields new ideas, but specific things that come with youth, like good health and lack of responsibilities.","[3]
But the problem is not just that we can't get the intelligence we need.
The problem is that we are not using it properly. We're not using it
for the right purposes. We're not using it to think for ourselves, but
to think for others. [4]
We are not using it to find new ideas, but to find new ways to
express the same old ideas. We're not using it to explore the unknown,
but to find the most efficient ways to find the same old things. [5]
We're not using it to create, but to copy, to improve, to
reproduce. [6]
And this is the crux of the problem. It's not that we lack
the ability to think for ourselves, but that we're not using the
ability we do have. [7]

Paul Graham,Why TV Lost.txt,"March 2009
About twenty years ago people noticed computers and TV were on a
collision course and started to speculate about what they'd produce
when they converged. We now know the answer: computers. It's clear
now that even by using the word ""convergence"" we were giving TV too
much credit. This won't be convergence so much as replacement. People may still watch things they call ""TV shows,"" but they'll
watch them mostly on computers. What decided the contest for computers? Four forces, three of which
one could have predicted, and one that would have been harder to. One predictable cause of victory is that the Internet is an open
platform. Anyone can build whatever they want on it, and the market
picks the winners. So innovation happens at hacker speeds instead
of big company speeds. The second is Moore's Law, which has worked its usual magic on
Internet bandwidth. [1]
The third reason computers won is piracy. Users prefer it
not just because it's free, but because it's
more convenient. Bittorrent and YouTube have already trained a new
generation of viewers that the place to watch shows is on a computer
screen. [2]
The somewhat more surprising force was one specific type of innovation:
social applications. The average teenage kid has a pretty much
infinite capacity for talking to their friends. But they can't
physically be with them all the time. When I was in high school
the solution was the telephone. Now it's social networks, multiplayer
games, and various messaging applications. The way you reach them
all is through a computer. [3]
Which means every teenage kid (a)
wants a computer with an Internet connection, (b) has an incentive
to figure out how to use it, and (c) spends countless hours in front
of it. This was the most powerful force of all. This was what made everyone
want computers. Nerds got computers because they liked them. Then
gamers got them to play games on. But it was connecting to other
people that got everyone else: that's what made even grandmas and
14 year old girls want computers. After decades of running an IV drip right into their audience,
people in the entertainment business had understandably come to
think of them as rather passive. They thought they'd be able to
dictate the way shows reached audiences. But they underestimated
the force of their desire to connect with one another. Facebook killed TV. That is wildly oversimplified, of course, but
probably as close to the truth as you can get in three words. ___
The TV networks already seem, grudgingly, to see where things are
going, and have responded by putting their stuff, grudgingly, online. But they're still dragging their heels. They still seem to wish
people would watch shows on TV instead, just as newspapers that put
their stories online still seem to wish people would wait till the
next morning and read them printed on paper.","They should both just face the fact that the Internet is the primary medium. They'd be in a better position if they'd done that earlier. When a new medium arises that's powerful enough to make incumbents nervous, then it's probably powerful enough to win, and the best thing they can do is jump in immediately. Whether they like it or not, big changes are coming, because the Internet dissolves the two cornerstones of broadcast media: synchronicity and locality. On the Internet, you don't have to send everyone the same signal, and you don't have to send it to them from a local source. People will watch what they want when they want it, and group themselves according to whatever shared interest they feel most strongly. Maybe their strongest shared interest will be their physical location, but I'm guessing not. Which means local TV is probably dead. It was an artifact of limitations imposed by old technology. If someone were creating an Internet-based TV company from scratch now, they might have some plan for shows aimed at specific regions, but it wouldn't be a top priority. Synchronicity and locality are tied together. TV network affiliates care what's on at 10 because that delivers viewers for local news at 11. This connection adds more brittleness than strength, however: people don't watch what's on at 10 because they want to watch the news afterward. TV networks will fight these trends, because they don't have sufficient flexibility to adapt to them. They're hemmed in by local affiliates in much the same way car companies are hemmed in by dealers and unions. Inevitably, the people running the networks will take the easy route and try to keep the old model running for a couple more years, just as the record labels have done. A recent article in the Wall Street Journal described how TV networks were trying to add more live shows, partly as a way to make viewers watch TV synchronously instead of watching recorded shows when it suited them. Instead of delivering what viewers want, they're trying to force them to change their habits to suit the networks' obsolete business model. That never works unless you have a monopoly or cartel to enforce it, and even then it only works temporarily. The other reason networks like live shows is that they're cheaper to produce. There they have the right idea, but they haven't followed it to its conclusion. Live content can be way cheaper than networks realize, and the way to take advantage of dramatic decreases in cost is to increase volume. The networks are prevented from seeing this whole line of reasoning because they still think of themselves as being in the broadcast business—as sending one signal to everyone. [4] ___ Now would be a good time to start any company that competes with TV networks. That's what a lot of Internet startups are, though they may not have had this as an explicit goal. People only have so many leisure hours","[4]
But it's not just the TV networks that are slow to change. The
entertainment industry as a whole is very slow to change. It's a
world of huge studios, massive production, and high costs, which
means it's hard to make a lot of money from small, niche content.
So, even if you wanted to make a show for a small, niche
audience, it would be too expensive. [5]
The Internet is not only a platform, but a distribution channel.
[6] It's the only channel that allows for direct distribution to
individuals. It's the only one that allows for the kind of
personalization that the Internet is known for. The Internet is
also a marketplace. [7] It's the only place where you can sell a single copy of a
product and have it be profitable. The Internet is a new
medium. [8] It's a place where the production is not necessarily
connected to the distribution or the marketing. In fact, it's
possible to make a movie on a computer, and then distribute it
online, and then market it with a website. The Internet is a new
medium, and it's not just that it's different, but that it's
completely different from anything that has come before. [9]
The Internet is a new medium. It's a new medium because it's
not just a distribution channel, not just a marketplace, but it's a
whole new way of making and consuming content. It's a new medium
because it's not just a way of doing things, but it's a new set of
rules. [10] The Internet is a new medium. It's a new medium because it's not just
a way of doing things, but it's a new set of rules. [11]

Paul Graham,Startup Investing Trends.txt,"June 2013
(This talk was written for an audience of investors.)
Y Combinator has now funded 564 startups including the current
batch, which has 53. The total valuation of the 287 that have
valuations (either by raising an equity round, getting acquired,
or dying) is about $11.7 billion, and the 511 prior to the current
batch have collectively raised about $1.7 billion. [1]
As usual those numbers are dominated by a few big winners. The top
10 startups account for 8.6 of that 11.7 billion. But there is a
peloton of younger startups behind them. There are about 40 more
that have a shot at being really big. Things got a little out of hand last summer when we had 84 companies
in the batch, so we tightened up our filter to decrease the batch
size. [2]
Several journalists have tried to interpret that as
evidence for some macro story they were telling, but the reason had
nothing to do with any external trend. The reason was that we
discovered we were using an n² algorithm, and we needed to buy
time to fix it. Fortunately we've come up with several techniques
for sharding YC, and the problem now seems to be fixed. With a new
more scaleable model and only 53 companies, the current batch feels
like a walk in the park. I'd guess we can grow another 2 or 3x
before hitting the next bottleneck. [3]
One consequence of funding such a large number of startups is that
we see trends early. And since fundraising is one of the main
things we help startups with, we're in a good position to notice
trends in investing. I'm going to take a shot at describing where these trends are
leading. Let's start with the most basic question: will the future
be better or worse than the past? Will investors, in the aggregate,
make more money or less? I think more. There are multiple forces at work, some of which
will decrease returns, and some of which will increase them. I
can't predict for sure which forces will prevail, but I'll describe
them and you can decide for yourself. There are two big forces driving change in startup funding: it's
becoming cheaper to start a startup, and startups are becoming a
more normal thing to do. When I graduated from college in 1986, there were essentially two
options: get a job or go to grad school. Now there's a third: start
your own company. That's a big change. In principle it was possible to start your
own company in 1986 too, but it didn't seem like a real possibility. It seemed possible to start a consulting company, or a niche product
company, but it didn't seem possible to start a company that would
become big. [4]
That kind of change, from 2 paths to 3, is the sort of big social
shift that only happens once every few generations. I think we're
still at the beginning of this one.","It's hard to predict how big a deal it will be. As big a deal as the Industrial Revolution? Maybe. Probably not. But it will be a big enough deal that it takes almost everyone by surprise, because those big social shifts always do. One thing we can say for sure is that there will be a lot more startups. The monolithic, hierarchical companies of the mid 20th century are being replaced by networks of smaller companies. This process is not just something happening now in Silicon Valley. It started decades ago, and it's happening as far afield as the car industry. It has a long way to run. [5] The other big driver of change is that startups are becoming cheaper to start. And in fact the two forces are related: the decreasing cost of starting a startup is one of the reasons startups are becoming a more normal thing to do. The fact that startups need less money means founders will increasingly have the upper hand over investors. You still need just as much of their energy and imagination, but they don't need as much of your money. Because founders have the upper hand, they'll retain an increasingly large share of the stock in, and control of, their companies. Which means investors will get less stock and less control. Does that mean investors will make less money? Not necessarily, because there will be more good startups. The total amount of desirable startup stock available to investors will probably increase, because the number of desirable startups will probably grow faster than the percentage they sell to investors shrinks. There's a rule of thumb in the VC business that there are about 15 companies a year that will be really successful. Although a lot of investors unconsciously treat this number as if it were some sort of cosmological constant, I'm certain it isn't. There are probably limits on the rate at which technology can develop, but that's not the limiting factor now. If it were, each successful startup would be founded the month it became possible, and that is not the case. Right now the limiting factor on the number of big hits is the number of sufficiently good founders starting companies, and that number can and will increase. There are still a lot of people who'd make great founders who never end up starting a company. You can see that from how randomly some of the most successful startups got started. So many of the biggest startups almost didn't happen that there must be a lot of equally good startups that actually didn't happen. There might be 10x or even 50x more good founders out there. As more of them go ahead and start startups, those 15 big hits a year could easily become 50 or even 100. [6] What about returns, though? Are we heading for a world in which returns will be pinched by increasingly high valuations? I think the top firms will actually make more money","The second force is that it's getting cheaper to start a
startup. The cost of living is going up, but the cost of starting a
startup is going down. For example, the cost of a laptop is going down, and the
cost of a server is going down, and the cost of a domain is going
down. You can start a startup for as little as $1,000. You can do it
in one room. You can have just one person. You can do it in a
few months. That's a big change. So, the two forces together are making it more likely that
people will start companies. So, we're at a point where the number of startups is growing
at an exponential rate. This is not a new trend, but it's now happening at a
much faster pace. We have been at this exponential growth for the past 15 years. But in the past 5 years, the growth has accelerated, and in the
past 2 years, it's been even faster. This is the kind of growth that's been going on in the past 10
years in the web, the mobile, and the cloud. It's the same kind of growth that happened in the 1990s with the
internet. So, we're seeing a new phase in the startup ecosystem. The next question is: what kind of companies are going to be
successful in this new phase? I think the answer is that the companies that are going to be
successful are the ones that are doing things that are not
only useful, but also interesting, and also easy to scale. That is, the companies that are doing things that are both
novel and scalable. But what's the difference between a novel idea and a
scalable idea? That's the key question. A novel idea is something that is new, not something that is
scalable.

Y Combinator. June 2006
(This essay is derived from talks at Usenix 2006 and
Railsconf 2006.)
A couple years ago my friend Trevor and I went to look at the Apple
garage. As we stood there, he said that as a kid growing up in
Saskatchewan he'd been amazed at the dedication Jobs and Wozniak
must have had to work in a garage. ""Those guys must have been
freezing!""
That's one of California's hidden advantages: the mild climate means
there's lots of marginal space. In cold places that margin gets
trimmed off. There's a sharper line between outside and inside,
and only projects that are officially sanctioned — by organizations,
or parents, or wives, or at least by oneself — get proper indoor
space. That raises the activation energy for new ideas. You can't
just tinker. You have to justify. Some of Silicon Valley's most famous companies began in garages:
Hewlett-Packard in 1938, Apple in 1976, Google in 1998. In Apple's
case the garage story is a bit of an urban legend. Woz says all
they did there was assemble some computers, and that he did all the
actual design of the Apple I and Apple II in his apartment or his
cube at HP. [1]
This was apparently too marginal even for Apple's PR
people. By conventional standards, Jobs and Wozniak were marginal people
too. Obviously they were smart, but they can't have looked good
on paper. They were at the time a pair of college dropouts with
about three years of school between them, and hippies to boot. Their previous business experience consisted of making ""blue boxes""
to hack into the phone system, a business with the rare distinction
of being both illegal and unprofitable. Outsiders
Now a startup operating out of a garage in Silicon Valley would
feel part of an exalted tradition, like the poet in his garret, or
the painter who can't afford to heat his studio and thus has to
wear a beret indoors. But in 1976 it didn't seem so cool. The
world hadn't yet realized that starting a computer company was in
the same category as being a writer or a painter. It hadn't been
for long. Only in the preceding couple years had the dramatic fall
in the cost of hardware allowed outsiders to compete. In 1976, everyone looked down on a company operating out of a garage,
including the founders. One of the first things Jobs did when they
got some money was to rent office space. He wanted Apple to seem
like a real company. They already had something few real companies ever have: a fabulously well
designed product. You'd think they'd have had more confidence. But I've talked to a lot of startup founders, and it's always this
way. They've built something that's going to change the world, and
they're worried about some nit like not having proper business
cards.","That's the paradox I want to explore: great new things often come from the margins, and yet the people who discover them are looked down on by everyone, including themselves. It's an old idea that new things come from the margins. I want to examine its internal structure. Why do great ideas come from the margins? What kind of ideas? And is there anything we can do to encourage the process? Insiders One reason so many good ideas come from the margin is simply that there's so much of it. There have to be more outsiders than insiders, if insider means anything. If the number of outsiders is huge it will always seem as if a lot of ideas come from them, even if few do per capita. But I think there's more going on than this. There are real disadvantages to being an insider, and in some kinds of work they can outweigh the advantages. Imagine, for example, what would happen if the government decided to commission someone to write an official Great American Novel. First there'd be a huge ideological squabble over who to choose. Most of the best writers would be excluded for having offended one side or the other. Of the remainder, the smart ones would refuse such a job, leaving only a few with the wrong sort of ambition. The committee would choose one at the height of his career — that is, someone whose best work was behind him — and hand over the project with copious free advice about how the book should show in positive terms the strength and diversity of the American people, etc, etc. The unfortunate writer would then sit down to work with a huge weight of expectation on his shoulders. Not wanting to blow such a public commission, he'd play it safe. This book had better command respect, and the way to ensure that would be to make it a tragedy. Audiences have to be enticed to laugh, but if you kill people they feel obliged to take you seriously. As everyone knows, America plus tragedy equals the Civil War, so that's what it would have to be about. When finally completed twelve years later, the book would be a 900-page pastiche of existing popular novels — roughly Gone with the Wind plus Roots. But its bulk and celebrity would make it a bestseller for a few months, until blown out of the water by a talk-show host's autobiography. The book would be made into a movie and thereupon forgotten, except by the more waspish sort of reviewers, among whom it would be a byword for bogusness like Milli Vanilli or Battlefield Earth. Maybe I got a little carried away with this example. And yet is this not at each point the way such a project would play out? The government knows better than to get into the novel business, but in other fields where they have a natural monopoly, like nuclear waste dumps, aircraft carriers, and regime","[2]
That's a problem. You can't have a company that's going to change the
world without a business plan. You can't have a company that's going to change the world without a business model. You can't have a company that's going to change the world without a proper set of
financial forecasts. It's not that the founders don't know that. It's that they're so focused on the product that they're not thinking about
the business. They think of the business as something that comes
after the product, when in reality it's something that comes
before. You can't build a product without a business plan. The business is the product. The product is the business. They are one and the same.
So here's the problem: you want to build something that's going to
change the world, but you have no idea how to make money with
it. So the problem is not just about the product, but about the business.
The problem is not just about the product, but about the business.
This is why I think that in order to create something that's going to change the world, you need to start with the business, not the product.
That's the idea behind Y Combinator. We don't give money to
startups based on their product. We give money based on their
business plan.
In fact, we give money to startups that don't even have a product yet.
So what's the business plan for a startup that doesn't have a product?
It's a hypothesis about how the business will work. It's a hypothesis
about how the business will make money, and how the product will
be built. It's a hypothesis about the market, the competition, the
customer, and the team. And we call this the ""minimum viable
business plan."" [3]
This is the core of Y Combinator. We call it the ""minimum viable
business plan",490,500,313,0.1082,0.1683,0.9714,0.9065,0.8487,0.8157,2.8403,-2.9375,0.3216,0.3131,0.0235,0.0402,0.0011,0.0159,0.3356,0.3969,0.9703,0.9409,0.4185639229422067,0.44642857142857145,0.47643979057591623,6,5,0.9054,0.9715,0.16938775510204082,0.124,0.22044728434504793,0.94,0.4897,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,The Future of Startup Funding .txt,"Want to start a startup? Get funded by
Y Combinator. August 2010
Two years ago I
wrote about what I called "" a huge, unexploited
opportunity in startup funding:"" the growing disconnect between
VCs, whose current business model requires them to invest large
amounts, and a large class of startups that need less than they
used to. Increasingly, startups want a couple hundred thousand
dollars, not a couple million. [1]
The opportunity is a lot less unexploited now. Investors have
poured into this territory from both directions. VCs are much more
likely to make angel-sized investments than they were a year ago. And meanwhile the past year has seen a dramatic increase in a new
type of investor: the super-angel, who operates like an angel, but
using other people's money, like a VC. Though a lot of investors are entering this territory, there is
still room for more. The distribution of investors should mirror
the distribution of startups, which has the usual power law dropoff. So there should be a lot more people investing tens or hundreds of
thousands than millions. [2]
In fact, it may be good for angels that there are more people doing
angel-sized deals, because if angel rounds become more legitimate,
then startups may start to opt for angel rounds even when they
could, if they wanted, raise series A rounds from VCs. One reason
startups prefer series A rounds is that they're more prestigious. But if angel investors become more active and better known, they'll
increasingly be able to compete with VCs in brand. Of course, prestige isn't the main reason to prefer a series A
round. A startup will probably get more attention from investors
in a series A round than an angel round. So if a startup is choosing
between an angel round and an A round from a good VC fund, I usually
advise them to take the A round. [3]
But while series A rounds aren't going away, I think VCs should be
more worried about super-angels than vice versa. Despite their
name, the super-angels are really mini VC funds, and they clearly
have existing VCs in their sights. They would seem to have history on their side. The pattern here seems the same
one we see when startups and established companies enter a new
market. Online video becomes possible, and YouTube plunges right
in, while existing media companies embrace it only half-willingly,
driven more by fear than hope, and aiming more to protect their
turf than to do great things for users. Ditto for PayPal. This
pattern is repeated over and over, and it's usually the invaders
who win. In this case the super-angels are the invaders. Angel
rounds are their whole business, as online video was for YouTube. Whereas VCs who make angel investments mostly do it as a way to
generate deal flow for series A rounds. [4]
On the other hand, startup investing is a very strange business.","Nearly all the returns are concentrated in a few big winners. If the super-angels merely fail to invest in (and to some extent produce) the big winners, they'll be out of business, even if they invest in all the others. VCs Why don't VCs start doing smaller series A rounds? The sticking point is board seats. In a traditional series A round, the partner whose deal it is takes a seat on the startup's board. If we assume the average startup runs for 6 years and a partner can bear to be on 12 boards at once, then a VC fund can do 2 series A deals per partner per year. It has always seemed to me the solution is to take fewer board seats. You don't have to be on the board to help a startup. Maybe VCs feel they need the power that comes with board membership to ensure their money isn't wasted. But have they tested that theory? Unless they've tried not taking board seats and found their returns are lower, they're not bracketing the problem. I'm not saying VCs don't help startups. The good ones help them a lot. What I'm saying is that the kind of help that matters, you may not have to be a board member to give. [5] How will this all play out? Some VCs will probably adapt, by doing more, smaller deals. I wouldn't be surprised if by streamlining their selection process and taking fewer board seats, VC funds could do 2 to 3 times as many series A rounds with no loss of quality. But other VCs will make no more than superficial changes. VCs are conservative, and the threat to them isn't mortal. The VC funds that don't adapt won't be violently displaced. They'll edge gradually into a different business without realizing it. They'll still do what they will call series A rounds, but these will increasingly be de facto series B rounds. [6] In such rounds they won't get the 25 to 40% of the company they do now. You don't give up as much of the company in later rounds unless something is seriously wrong. Since the VCs who don't adapt will be investing later, their returns from winners may be smaller. But investing later should also mean they have fewer losers. So their ratio of risk to return may be the same or even better. They'll just have become a different, more conservative, type of investment. Angels In the big angel rounds that increasingly compete with series A rounds, the investors won't take as much equity as VCs do now. And VCs who try to compete with angels by doing more, smaller deals will probably find they have to take less equity to do it. Which is good news for founders: they'll get to keep more of the company. The deal terms of angel rounds will become less restrictive too—not just less restrictive than series A terms, but less restrictive than angel terms have traditionally","The
way that VCs are funded is a very strange thing. When VCs are
funded by other VCs, they are actually investing in a different
kind of investment than they are when they are funded by
individuals. If the VCs are funded by other VCs, then they are not
just investing in startups, but in the entire VC industry. In that case, they are actually investing in the future of the VC
industry, which is a very long-term investment. But if the VCs are funded by individuals, then they are
investing in the future of startups. That's a different
kind of investment. The VC industry is the only business in which you
can invest in the future of the business itself. [5]
So what's the solution? I think the solution is for VCs to be more
active in the early stage space. Not just to do angel rounds, but
to be active in the early stage space, which is the same as
doing angel rounds. If VCs are more active in the early stage space, then
they can help the industry grow, and the industry can help them
grow. But VCs are not doing that now. They are too focused on the later stage, on the series A and later
rounds. That's a mistake. [6]
The conclusion is that VCs are not the only investors, and the
super-angels are a big part of the new investment landscape. And VCs should be more concerned with super-angels than with
other investors. Also, VCs should be more active in the early stage space, not just
doing angel rounds, but being active in the early stage. [7]
The author is arguing that VCs are not the only investors, and that
super-angels are a big part of the new investment landscape. The author is also arguing that VCs should be more concerned with

Paul Graham,The Other Half of _Artists Ship_  .txt,"November 2008
One of the differences between big companies and startups is that
big companies tend to have developed procedures to protect themselves
against mistakes. A startup walks like a toddler, bashing
into things and falling over all the time. A big company is more
deliberate. The gradual accumulation of checks in an organization is a kind of
learning, based on disasters that have happened to it or others
like it. After giving a contract to a supplier who goes bankrupt
and fails to deliver, for example, a company might require all
suppliers to prove they're solvent before submitting bids. As companies grow they invariably get more such checks, either in
response to disasters they've suffered, or (probably more often)
by hiring people from bigger companies who bring with them customs
for protecting against new types of disasters. It's natural for organizations to learn from mistakes. The problem
is, people who propose new checks almost never consider that the
check itself has a cost. Every check has a cost. For example, consider the case of making
suppliers verify their solvency. Surely that's mere prudence? But
in fact it could have substantial costs. There's obviously the
direct cost in time of the people on both sides who supply and check
proofs of the supplier's solvency. But the real costs are the ones
you never hear about: the company that would be the best supplier,
but doesn't bid because they can't spare the effort to get verified. Or the company that would be the best supplier, but falls just short
of the threshold for solvency—which will of course have been set
on the high side, since there is no apparent cost of increasing it. Whenever someone in an organization proposes to add a new check,
they should have to explain not just the benefit but the cost. No
matter how bad a job they did of analyzing it, this meta-check would
at least remind everyone there had to be a cost, and send them
looking for it. If companies started doing that, they'd find some surprises. Joel
Spolsky recently spoke at Y Combinator about selling software to
corporate customers. He said that in most companies software costing
up to about $1000 could be bought by individual managers without
any additional approvals. Above that threshold, software purchases
generally had to be approved by a committee. But babysitting this
process was so expensive for software vendors that it didn't make
sense to charge less than $50,000. Which means if you're making
something you might otherwise have charged $5000 for, you have to
sell it for $50,000 instead. The purpose of the committee is presumably to ensure that the company
doesn't waste money. And yet the result is that the company pays
10 times as much. Checks on purchases will always be expensive, because the harder
it is to sell something to you, the more it has to cost. And not
merely linearly, either.","If you're hard enough to sell to, the people who are best at making things don't want to bother. The only people who will sell to you are companies that specialize in selling to you. Then you've sunk to a whole new level of inefficiency. Market mechanisms no longer protect you, because the good suppliers are no longer in the market. Such things happen constantly to the biggest organizations of all, governments. But checks instituted by governments can cause much worse problems than merely overpaying. Checks instituted by governments can cripple a country's whole economy. Up till about 1400, China was richer and more technologically advanced than Europe. One reason Europe pulled ahead was that the Chinese government restricted long trading voyages. So it was left to the Europeans to explore and eventually to dominate the rest of the world, including China. In more recent times, Sarbanes-Oxley has practically destroyed the US IPO market. That wasn't the intention of the legislators who wrote it. They just wanted to add a few more checks on public companies. But they forgot to consider the cost. They forgot that companies about to go public are usually rather stretched, and that the weight of a few extra checks that might be easy for General Electric to bear are enough to prevent younger companies from being public at all. Once you start to think about the cost of checks, you can start to ask other interesting questions. Is the cost increasing or decreasing? Is it higher in some areas than others? Where does it increase discontinuously? If large organizations started to ask questions like that, they'd learn some frightening things. I think the cost of checks may actually be increasing. The reason is that software plays an increasingly important role in companies, and the people who write software are particularly harmed by checks. Programmers are unlike many types of workers in that the best ones actually prefer to work hard. This doesn't seem to be the case in most types of work. When I worked in fast food, we didn't prefer the busy times. And when I used to mow lawns, I definitely didn't prefer it when the grass was long after a week of rain. Programmers, though, like it better when they write more code. Or more precisely, when they release more code. Programmers like to make a difference. Good ones, anyway. For good programmers, one of the best things about working for a startup is that there are few checks on releases. In true startups, there are no external checks at all. If you have an idea for a new feature in the morning, you can write it and push it to the production servers before lunch. And when you can do that, you have more ideas. At big companies, software has to go through various approvals before it can be launched. And the cost of doing this can be enormous—in fact, discontinuous. I was talking recently to a group of three programmers","The more checks you have, the more expensive it becomes to sell.
So, the problem is that checks are an inherent cost of doing business.
They are not a way of avoiding risk, but rather a way of
inherently increasing the cost of doing business. So, the conclusion is that we should not be
afraid of risk. We should be afraid of checks. So, the solution is to try to avoid the checks as much as possible.
So, the solution is to either reduce the number of checks, or to make
them as low cost as possible. The best way to do that is to make the checks
as simple as possible. The more checks you have, the more you have to
think about the cost of doing business. So, if you're a company, and you're trying to
make a decision on whether to add a check, the question is: is the benefit
of that check worth the cost? If the answer is yes, then add it.
But if the answer is no, then don't add it. So, the point is that the cost of checks
should be considered in the decision-making process. This is the
key idea. The key idea is that checks are not a way to avoid risk, but a way
to increase the cost of doing business. So, the conclusion is that we should be afraid of checks, not of risk. And the solution is to reduce the number of checks and make them as low cost
as possible. So, the key idea is that we should be afraid of checks, not of risk.
So, the key idea is that checks are not a way to avoid risk, but a way to increase the cost of doing business. And that the solution is to reduce the checks or make them low cost.

Paul Graham,How to Be an Angel Investor.txt,"March 2009
(This essay is derived from a talk at AngelConf.)
When we sold our startup in 1998 I thought one day I'd do some angel
investing. Seven years later I still hadn't started. I put it off
because it seemed mysterious and complicated. It turns out to be
easier than I expected, and also more interesting. The part I thought was hard, the mechanics of investing, really
isn't. You give a startup money and they give you stock. You'll
probably get either preferred stock, which means stock with extra
rights like getting your money back first in a sale, or convertible
debt, which means (on paper) you're lending the company money, and
the debt converts to stock at the next sufficiently big funding
round. [1]
There are sometimes minor tactical advantages to using one or the
other. The paperwork for convertible debt is simpler. But really
it doesn't matter much which you use. Don't spend much time worrying
about the details of deal terms, especially when you first start
angel investing. That's not how you win at this game. When you
hear people talking about a successful angel investor, they're not
saying ""He got a 4x liquidation preference."" They're saying ""He
invested in Google.""
That's how you win: by investing in the right startups. That is
so much more important than anything else that I worry I'm misleading
you by even talking about other things. Mechanics
Angel investors often syndicate deals, which means they join together
to invest on the same terms. In a syndicate there is usually a
""lead"" investor who negotiates the terms with the startup. But not
always: sometimes the startup cobbles together a syndicate of
investors who approach them independently, and the startup's lawyer
supplies the paperwork. The easiest way to get started in angel investing is to find a
friend who already does it, and try to get included in his syndicates. Then all you have to do is write checks. Don't feel like you have to join a syndicate, though. It's not that
hard to do it yourself. You can just use the standard
series AA
documents Wilson Sonsini and Y Combinator published online. You should of course have your lawyer review everything. Both you
and the startup should have lawyers. But the lawyers don't have
to create the agreement from scratch. [2]
When you negotiate terms with a startup, there are two numbers you
care about: how much money you're putting in, and the valuation of
the company. The valuation determines how much stock you get. If
you put $50,000 into a company at a pre-money valuation of $1
million, then the post-money valuation is $1.05 million, and you
get .05/1.05, or 4.76% of the company's stock. If the company raises more money later, the new investor will take
a chunk of the company away from all the existing shareholders just
as you did.","If in the next round they sell 10% of the company to a new investor, your 4.76% will be reduced to 4.28%. That's ok. Dilution is normal. What saves you from being mistreated in future rounds, usually, is that you're in the same boat as the founders. They can't dilute you without diluting themselves just as much. And they won't dilute themselves unless they end up net ahead. So in theory, each further round of investment leaves you with a smaller share of an even more valuable company, till after several more rounds you end up with .5% of the company at the point where it IPOs, and you are very happy because your $50,000 has become $5 million. [3] The agreement by which you invest should have provisions that let you contribute to future rounds to maintain your percentage. So it's your choice whether you get diluted. [4] If the company does really well, you eventually will, because eventually the valuations will get so high it's not worth it for you. How much does an angel invest? That varies enormously, from $10,000 to hundreds of thousands or in rare cases even millions. The upper bound is obviously the total amount the founders want to raise. The lower bound is 5-10% of the total or $10,000, whichever is greater. A typical angel round these days might be $150,000 raised from 5 people. Valuations don't vary as much. For angel rounds it's rare to see a valuation lower than half a million or higher than 4 or 5 million. 4 million is starting to be VC territory. How do you decide what valuation to offer? If you're part of a round led by someone else, that problem is solved for you. But what if you're investing by yourself? There's no real answer. There is no rational way to value an early stage startup. The valuation reflects nothing more than the strength of the company's bargaining position. If they really want you, either because they desperately need money, or you're someone who can help them a lot, they'll let you invest at a low valuation. If they don't need you, it will be higher. So guess. The startup may not have any more idea what the number should be than you do. [5] Ultimately it doesn't matter much. When angels make a lot of money from a deal, it's not because they invested at a valuation of $1.5 million instead of $3 million. It's because the company was really successful. I can't emphasize that too much. Don't get hung up on mechanics or deal terms. What you should spend your time thinking about is whether the company is good. (Similarly, founders also should not get hung up on deal terms, but should spend their time thinking about how to make the company good.) There's a second less obvious component of an angel investment: how much you're expected to help the startup. Like the amount you invest, this can vary a lot. You","That's why the valuation is so important. You don't want
to put in too much money, because that would make the valuation
too low and make the stock you get too diluted. But you don't want to
put in too little either, because that would make the valuation
too high, and the stock you get would be too low. [3]
So the key is to pick a valuation that is just right for your
investment. If you can find a startup that is doing something
interesting and is in a market that is growing, then you can go
with a higher valuation. If you're investing in an early stage
company that has a hard time getting funding, then you have to go
with a lower valuation. The valuation is a big deal, and it's hard to get right.
But here's a trick: the first round of funding is usually the most
valuable. If a company is able to get funding in the first round, that
suggests that the market is growing, that the company is viable, and
that the company has a strong management team. So even if the company
is at the early stage, the first round valuation is a good estimate
of the true value. That's why I say that when you're investing in a
startup, the first round valuation is the most important thing. [4]
So, what is a good valuation? Let me give you some examples. If
a company is raising $1 million in a Series A round, and they have
pre-money valuation of $5 million, then the valuation is $5
million. If they raise $1 million, then the post-money valuation is
$6 million. If the company has a $20 million pre-money valuation and
raises $1 million, then the valuation is $20 million. So the valuation is the pre-money valuation. [5]
So the valuation is the pre-money valuation.

Paul Graham,How to Do What You Love.txt,"Want to start a startup? Get funded by
Y Combinator. January 2006
To do something well you have to like it. That idea is not exactly
novel. We've got it down to four words: ""Do what you love."" But
it's not enough just to tell people that. Doing what you love is
complicated. The very idea is foreign to what most of us learn as kids. When I
was a kid, it seemed as if work and fun were opposites by definition. Life had two states: some of the time adults were making you do
things, and that was called work; the rest of the time you could
do what you wanted, and that was called playing. Occasionally the
things adults made you do were fun, just as, occasionally, playing
wasn't — for example, if you fell and hurt yourself. But except
for these few anomalous cases, work was pretty much defined as
not-fun. And it did not seem to be an accident. School, it was implied, was
tedious because it was preparation for grownup work. The world then was divided into two groups, grownups and kids. Grownups, like some kind of cursed race, had to work. Kids didn't,
but they did have to go to school, which was a dilute version of
work meant to prepare us for the real thing. Much as we disliked
school, the grownups all agreed that grownup work was worse, and
that we had it easy. Teachers in particular all seemed to believe implicitly that work
was not fun. Which is not surprising: work wasn't fun for most of
them. Why did we have to memorize state capitals instead of playing
dodgeball? For the same reason they had to watch over a bunch of
kids instead of lying on a beach. You couldn't just do what you
wanted. I'm not saying we should let little kids do whatever they want. They may have to be made to work on certain things. But if we make
kids work on dull stuff, it might be wise to tell them that tediousness
is not the defining quality of work, and indeed that the reason
they have to work on dull stuff now is so they can work on more
interesting stuff later. [1]
Once, when I was about 9 or 10, my father told me I could be whatever
I wanted when I grew up, so long as I enjoyed it. I remember that
precisely because it seemed so anomalous. It was like being told
to use dry water. Whatever I thought he meant, I didn't think he
meant work could literally be fun — fun like playing. It
took me years to grasp that. Jobs
By high school, the prospect of an actual job was on the horizon. Adults would sometimes come to speak to us about their work, or we
would go to see them at work. It was always understood that they
enjoyed what they did.","In retrospect I think one may have: the private jet pilot. But I don't think the bank manager really did. The main reason they all acted as if they enjoyed their work was presumably the upper-middle class convention that you're supposed to. It would not merely be bad for your career to say that you despised your job, but a social faux-pas. Why is it conventional to pretend to like what you do? The first sentence of this essay explains that. If you have to like something to do it well, then the most successful people will all like what they do. That's where the upper-middle class tradition comes from. Just as houses all over America are full of chairs that are, without the owners even knowing it, nth-degree imitations of chairs designed 250 years ago for French kings, conventional attitudes about work are, without the owners even knowing it, nth-degree imitations of the attitudes of people who've done great things. What a recipe for alienation. By the time they reach an age to think about what they'd like to do, most kids have been thoroughly misled about the idea of loving one's work. School has trained them to regard work as an unpleasant duty. Having a job is said to be even more onerous than schoolwork. And yet all the adults claim to like what they do. You can't blame kids for thinking ""I am not like these people; I am not suited to this world."" Actually they've been told three lies: the stuff they've been taught to regard as work in school is not real work; grownup work is not (necessarily) worse than schoolwork; and many of the adults around them are lying when they say they like what they do. The most dangerous liars can be the kids' own parents. If you take a boring job to give your family a high standard of living, as so many people do, you risk infecting your kids with the idea that work is boring. [2] Maybe it would be better for kids in this one case if parents were not so unselfish. A parent who set an example of loving their work might help their kids more than an expensive house. [3] It was not till I was in college that the idea of work finally broke free from the idea of making a living. Then the important question became not how to make money, but what to work on. Ideally these coincided, but some spectacular boundary cases (like Einstein in the patent office) proved they weren't identical. The definition of work was now to make some original contribution to the world, and in the process not to starve. But after the habit of so many years my idea of work still included a large component of pain. Work still seemed to require discipline, because only hard problems yielded grand results, and hard problems couldn't literally be fun. Surely one had to force oneself to work on them. If","In my case, my father's job was in the
financial sector. He had to work long hours, but he was always
enthusiastic about what he did. I would watch him, and I would think that maybe, if I could find a job I
enjoyed, I could do that too. I was also aware that the people I saw at work were not just doing
what they liked. They were doing what they had to do. The same people who
were enthusiastic about their jobs were often in the same room
as people who were clearly not. I was confused. I didn't understand why some people enjoyed their work and
others didn't. I was told that some people were just not good at
work. But that didn't make sense. If you don't enjoy your work, you're not good at it, right? That's the whole point. So, I was confused. I didn't understand why some people
were not good at work. I was told that some people were just not good at work. But that didn't make sense. If you don't enjoy your work, you're not good at it, right? That's the whole point. So, I was confused. I didn't understand why some people
were not good at work. [2]
In the end, the answer was that some people were not good at work
because they had to work on things that were not fun. It was not that they were not good at work, but that their work was not fun. So, the key to finding a job you enjoy is to find a job that is not
boring. But that's not the answer that's usually given. In fact, the usual answer is the opposite: that you must find a job
that you enjoy. Which is the exact opposite of what I just said. That is
why, in the end, I didn't understand why some people were not

Paul Graham,The Acceleration of Addictiveness.txt,"July 2010
What hard liquor, cigarettes, heroin, and crack have in common is
that they're all more concentrated forms of less addictive predecessors. Most if not all the things we describe as addictive are. And the
scary thing is, the process that created them is accelerating. We wouldn't want to stop it. It's the same process that cures
diseases: technological progress. Technological progress means
making things do more of what we want. When the thing we want is
something we want to want, we consider technological progress good. If some new technique makes solar cells x% more efficient, that
seems strictly better. When progress concentrates something we
don't want to want — when it transforms opium into heroin — it seems
bad. But it's the same process at work. [1]
No one doubts this process is accelerating, which means increasing
numbers of things we like will be transformed into things we like
too much. [2]
As far as I know there's no word for something we like too much. The closest is the colloquial sense of ""addictive."" That usage has
become increasingly common during my lifetime. And it's clear why:
there are an increasing number of things we need it for. At the
extreme end of the spectrum are crack and meth. Food has been
transformed by a combination of factory farming and innovations in
food processing into something with way more immediate bang for the
buck, and you can see the results in any town in America. Checkers
and solitaire have been replaced by World of Warcraft and FarmVille. TV has become much more engaging, and even so it can't compete with Facebook. The world is more addictive than it was 40 years ago. And unless
the forms of technological progress that produced these things are
subject to different laws than technological progress in general,
the world will get more addictive in the next 40 years than it did
in the last 40. The next 40 years will bring us some wonderful things. I don't
mean to imply they're all to be avoided. Alcohol is a dangerous
drug, but I'd rather live in a world with wine than one without. Most people can coexist with alcohol; but you have to be careful. More things we like will mean more things we have to be careful
about. Most people won't, unfortunately. Which means that as the world
becomes more addictive, the two senses in which one can live a
normal life will be driven ever further apart. One sense of ""normal""
is statistically normal: what everyone else does. The other is the
sense we mean when we talk about the normal operating range of a
piece of machinery: what works best. These two senses are already quite far apart. Already someone
trying to live well would seem eccentrically abstemious in most of
the US. That phenomenon is only going to become more pronounced.","You can probably take it as a rule of thumb from now on that if people don't think you're weird, you're living badly. Societies eventually develop antibodies to addictive new things. I've seen that happen with cigarettes. When cigarettes first appeared, they spread the way an infectious disease spreads through a previously isolated population. Smoking rapidly became a (statistically) normal thing. There were ashtrays everywhere. We had ashtrays in our house when I was a kid, even though neither of my parents smoked. You had to for guests. As knowledge spread about the dangers of smoking, customs changed. In the last 20 years, smoking has been transformed from something that seemed totally normal into a rather seedy habit: from something movie stars did in publicity shots to something small huddles of addicts do outside the doors of office buildings. A lot of the change was due to legislation, of course, but the legislation couldn't have happened if customs hadn't already changed. It took a while though—on the order of 100 years. And unless the rate at which social antibodies evolve can increase to match the accelerating rate at which technological progress throws off new addictions, we'll be increasingly unable to rely on customs to protect us. [3] Unless we want to be canaries in the coal mine of each new addiction—the people whose sad example becomes a lesson to future generations—we'll have to figure out for ourselves what to avoid and how. It will actually become a reasonable strategy (or a more reasonable strategy) to suspect everything new. In fact, even that won't be enough. We'll have to worry not just about new things, but also about existing things becoming more addictive. That's what bit me. I've avoided most addictions, but the Internet got me because it became addictive while I was using it. [4] Most people I know have problems with Internet addiction. We're all trying to figure out our own customs for getting free of it. That's why I don't have an iPhone, for example; the last thing I want is for the Internet to follow me out into the world. [5] My latest trick is taking long hikes. I used to think running was a better form of exercise than hiking because it took less time. Now the slowness of hiking seems an advantage, because the longer I spend on the trail, the longer I have to think without interruption. Sounds pretty eccentric, doesn't it? It always will when you're trying to solve problems where there are no customs yet to guide you. Maybe I can't plead Occam's razor; maybe I'm simply eccentric. But if I'm right about the acceleration of addictiveness, then this kind of lonely squirming to avoid it will increasingly be the fate of anyone who wants to get things done. We'll increasingly be defined by what we say no to. Notes [1] Could you restrict technological progress to areas where you wanted it? Only in a limited way, without becoming a police state.","The
result is that in the future, people who want to live well will have
to be more careful and more thoughtful about what they do, but
the rest of the world will be going more and more in the opposite
direction. [3]
[1] The author's argument is that technological progress is a
process that can be good or bad, depending on what it's applied to. The
author is not arguing that technological progress is bad, but that it's
possible for it to be bad.
[2] The author uses the example of food, video games, and TV to
show that the process that makes things more addictive is
accelerating.
[3] The author is arguing that as the world becomes more
addictive, the line between what is normal and what is best will
become more blurred. People who want to live well will have to be
more careful and thoughtful, but the rest of the world will be
going in the opposite direction.

So the author's main point is that technological progress is a double-edged sword, capable of both positive and negative outcomes, and the negative outcomes are becoming more pronounced as the process accelerates. The author acknowledges the value of technological progress but warns that when it is applied to things we want to want, it can lead to unintended consequences, such as increased addiction and overconsumption. The author concludes that while technological progress will bring us wonderful things, we must be more cautious about how we apply it, especially when it comes to things that could negatively impact our lives.

Paul Graham,Economic Inequality.txt,"January 2016
Since the 1970s, economic inequality in the US has increased
dramatically. And in particular, the rich have gotten a lot richer. Nearly everyone who writes about the topic says that economic inequality
should be decreased. I'm interested in this question because I was one of the founders of
a company called Y Combinator that helps people start startups. Almost by definition, if a startup succeeds, its founders become
rich. Which means by helping startup founders I've been helping to
increase economic inequality. If economic inequality should be
decreased, I shouldn't be helping founders. No one should
be. But that doesn't sound right. What's going on here? What's going
on is that while economic inequality is a single measure (or more
precisely, two: variation in income, and variation in wealth), it
has multiple causes. Many of these causes are bad, like tax loopholes
and drug addiction. But some are good, like Larry Page and
Sergey Brin starting the company you use to find things online. If you want to understand economic inequality — and more importantly,
if you actually want to fix the bad aspects of it — you have to
tease apart the components. And yet the trend in nearly everything
written about the subject is to do the opposite: to squash together
all the aspects of economic inequality as if it were a single
phenomenon. Sometimes this is done for ideological reasons. Sometimes it's
because the writer only has very high-level data and so draws
conclusions from that, like the proverbial drunk who looks for his
keys under the lamppost, instead of where he dropped them, because the
light is better there. Sometimes it's because the writer doesn't
understand critical aspects of inequality, like the role of technology
in wealth creation. Much of the time, perhaps most of the time,
writing about economic inequality combines all three. ___
The most common mistake people make about economic inequality is
to treat it as a single phenomenon. The most naive version of which
is the one based on the pie fallacy: that the rich get rich by
taking money from the poor. Usually this is an assumption people start from rather than a
conclusion they arrive at by examining the evidence. Sometimes the
pie fallacy is stated explicitly:
...those at the top are grabbing an increasing fraction of the
nation's income — so much of a larger share that what's left over
for the rest is diminished.... [1]
Other times it's more unconscious. But the unconscious form is very
widespread. I think because we grow up in a world where the pie
fallacy is actually true. To kids, wealth is a fixed pie
that's shared out, and if one person gets more, it's at the expense
of another. It takes a conscious effort to remind oneself that the
real world doesn't work that way. In the real world you can create wealth as well as taking it from
others. A woodworker creates wealth.","He makes a chair, and you willingly give him money in return for it. A high-frequency trader does not. He makes a dollar only when someone on the other end of a trade loses a dollar. If the rich people in a society got that way by taking wealth from the poor, then you have the degenerate case of economic inequality, where the cause of poverty is the same as the cause of wealth. But instances of inequality don't have to be instances of the degenerate case. If one woodworker makes 5 chairs and another makes none, the second woodworker will have less money, but not because anyone took anything from him. Even people sophisticated enough to know about the pie fallacy are led toward it by the custom of describing economic inequality as a ratio of one quantile's income or wealth to another's. It's so easy to slip from talking about income shifting from one quantile to another, as a figure of speech, into believing that is literally what's happening. Except in the degenerate case, economic inequality can't be described by a ratio or even a curve. In the general case it consists of multiple ways people become poor, and multiple ways people become rich. Which means to understand economic inequality in a country, you have to go find individual people who are poor or rich and figure out why. [2] If you want to understand change in economic inequality, you should ask what those people would have done when it was different. This is one way I know the rich aren't all getting richer simply from some new system for transferring wealth to them from everyone else. When you use the would-have method with startup founders, you find what most would have done back in 1960 , when economic inequality was lower, was to join big companies or become professors. Before Mark Zuckerberg started Facebook, his default expectation was that he'd end up working at Microsoft. The reason he and most other startup founders are richer than they would have been in the mid 20th century is not because of some right turn the country took during the Reagan administration, but because progress in technology has made it much easier to start a new company that grows fast . Traditional economists seem strangely averse to studying individual humans. It seems to be a rule with them that everything has to start with statistics. So they give you very precise numbers about variation in wealth and income, then follow it with the most naive speculation about the underlying causes. But while there are a lot of people who get rich through rent-seeking of various forms, and a lot who get rich by playing zero-sum games, there are also a significant number who get rich by creating wealth. And creating wealth, as a source of economic inequality, is different from taking it — not just morally, but also practically, in the sense that it is harder to eradicate. One reason","A farmer creates wealth. A programmer creates wealth. A startup founder creates wealth. All of them are creating wealth. So the real world is not a fixed pie. It's an expanding pie. The real world is not a fixed pie. So when people say, ""the rich get richer at the expense of the poor,"" that's not a
description of the real world. That's a description of a world that has a fixed pie. The rich get richer in the real world by creating new wealth. In fact, in the real world, the rich get richer by creating
new wealth and the poor get richer by participating in the
creation of new wealth. So the real world is not a fixed pie. It's an expanding pie. This is a very important distinction. I think the reason we are so often confused about the real
world is that we're so used to thinking of it as a fixed pie. So the real world is not a fixed pie. It's an expanding pie. The problem is that we are not
able to see the whole pie. The real world is not a fixed pie. It's an expanding pie. So the key to understanding economic inequality is to understand the
difference between the two. The key to understanding economic inequality is to understand the
difference between the two. It's not that the rich are taking from the poor. It's that the rich are creating wealth, and the poor are also creating
wealth. The problem is that we are not

Paul Graham,Black Swan Farming.txt,"Want to start a startup? Get funded by
Y Combinator. September 2012
I've done several types of work over the years but I don't know
another as counterintuitive as startup investing. The two most important things to understand about startup investing,
as a business, are (1) that effectively all the returns are
concentrated in a few big winners, and (2) that the best ideas look
initially like bad ideas. The first rule I knew intellectually, but didn't really grasp till
it happened to us. The total value of the companies we've funded
is around 10 billion, give or take a few. But just two companies,
Dropbox and Airbnb, account for about three quarters of it. In startups, the big winners are big to a degree that violates our
expectations about variation. I don't know whether these expectations
are innate or learned, but whatever the cause, we are just not
prepared for the 1000x variation in outcomes that one finds in
startup investing. That yields all sorts of strange consequences. For example, in
purely financial terms, there is probably at most one company in
each YC batch that will have a significant effect on our returns,
and the rest are just a cost of doing business. [1]
I haven't
really assimilated that fact, partly because it's so counterintuitive,
and partly because we're not doing this just for financial reasons;
YC would be a pretty lonely place if we only had one company per
batch. And yet it's true. To succeed in a domain that violates your intuitions, you need to
be able to turn them off the way a pilot does when flying through
clouds. [2]
You need to do what you know intellectually to be
right, even though it feels wrong. It's a constant battle for us. It's hard to make ourselves take
enough risks. When you interview a startup and think ""they seem
likely to succeed,"" it's hard not to fund them. And yet, financially
at least, there is only one kind of success: they're either going
to be one of the really big winners or not, and if not it doesn't
matter whether you fund them, because even if they succeed the
effect on your returns will be insignificant. In the same day of
interviews you might meet some smart 19 year olds who aren't even
sure what they want to work on. Their chances of succeeding seem
small. But again, it's not their chances of succeeding that matter
but their chances of succeeding really big. The probability that
any group will succeed really big is microscopically small, but the
probability that those 19 year olds will might be higher than that
of the other, safer group. The probability that a startup will make it big is not simply a
constant fraction of the probability that they will succeed at all. If it were, you could fund everyone who seemed likely to succeed
at all, and you'd get that fraction of big hits.","Unfortunately picking winners is harder than that. You have to ignore the elephant in front of you, the likelihood they'll succeed, and focus instead on the separate and almost invisibly intangible question of whether they'll succeed really big. Harder That's made harder by the fact that the best startup ideas seem at first like bad ideas. I've written about this before: if a good idea were obviously good, someone else would already have done it. So the most successful founders tend to work on ideas that few beside them realize are good. Which is not that far from a description of insanity, till you reach the point where you see results. The first time Peter Thiel spoke at YC he drew a Venn diagram that illustrates the situation perfectly. He drew two intersecting circles, one labelled ""seems like a bad idea"" and the other ""is a good idea."" The intersection is the sweet spot for startups. This concept is a simple one and yet seeing it as a Venn diagram is illuminating. It reminds you that there is an intersection—that there are good ideas that seem bad. It also reminds you that the vast majority of ideas that seem bad are bad. The fact that the best ideas seem like bad ideas makes it even harder to recognize the big winners. It means the probability of a startup making it really big is not merely not a constant fraction of the probability that it will succeed, but that the startups with a high probability of the former will seem to have a disproportionately low probability of the latter. History tends to get rewritten by big successes, so that in retrospect it seems obvious they were going to make it big. For that reason one of my most valuable memories is how lame Facebook sounded to me when I first heard about it. A site for college students to waste time? It seemed the perfect bad idea: a site (1) for a niche market (2) with no money (3) to do something that didn't matter. One could have described Microsoft and Apple in exactly the same terms. [3] Harder Still Wait, it gets worse. You not only have to solve this hard problem, but you have to do it with no indication of whether you're succeeding. When you pick a big winner, you won't know it for two years. Meanwhile, the one thing you can measure is dangerously misleading. The one thing we can track precisely is how well the startups in each batch do at fundraising after Demo Day. But we know that's the wrong metric. There's no correlation between the percentage of startups that raise money and the metric that does matter financially, whether that batch of startups contains a big winner or not. Except an inverse one. That's the scary thing: fundraising is not merely a useless metric, but positively misleading. We're in a business where we need to pick unpromising-looking outliers, and the huge scale of the","But in reality, the
probability that a startup will make it big is not only not a
constant fraction of the probability that they will succeed, but it
is in fact a small fraction of that. So you have to be very careful to select the ones that are most
likely to make it big, not just the most likely to succeed. [3]

The second part of the two most important things to understand
about startup investing is that the best ideas look initially like
bad ideas. This is a bit more subtle. It's not that the best ideas are
actually bad, but that they seem bad. When you're early in the
development of a product, it's very hard to see what's really
going on. The product is in a state of flux. It's hard to tell what
the real problem is, and what the real solution is. So, for example, if
you're trying to build a product that helps people organize their
digital lives, you might start out with a very simple product that
just helps people organize their calendars. But that's not the
real problem, and the real solution is more complicated. The idea
seems like a bad idea, but it's a good idea. It's a starting point
that will lead to something much better. So, in the early stages, it's important to be very
careful in what you think is a good idea. If you think that a
simple idea is a good idea, that's a sign that you've already
started to have a plan, and that you've lost the ability to be
open to the real problem and the real solution that might come
from a more complicated idea. In the end, the best ideas are the ones that seem bad at first,
but then become good. [4]

So, in summary, the two most important things to understand
about startup investing are (1) that the returns are concentrated

Paul Graham,A Plan for Spam.txt,"Like to build things? Try Hacker
News. August 2002
(This article describes the spam-filtering techniques
used in the spamproof web-based mail reader we
built to exercise Arc. An
improved algorithm is described in Better
Bayesian Filtering.)
I think it's possible to stop spam, and that
content-based filters are the way to do it. The Achilles heel of the spammers is their message. They can circumvent any other barrier you set up. They have so far, at
least. But they have to deliver their message, whatever it
is. If we can write software that recognizes their messages,
there is no way they can get around that. _ _ _
To the recipient, spam is easily recognizable. If you hired
someone to read your mail and discard the spam, they would
have little trouble doing it. How much do we have
to do, short of AI, to automate this process? I think we will be able to solve the problem with fairly
simple algorithms. In fact, I've found that you can filter
present-day spam acceptably well using nothing more than a
Bayesian combination of the spam probabilities of individual
words. Using a slightly tweaked (as described below) Bayesian
filter, we now miss less than 5 per 1000 spams, with 0 false positives. The statistical approach is not usually the first one people
try when they write spam filters. Most hackers' first instinct is
to try to write software that recognizes individual properties of
spam. You look at spams
and you think, the gall of these guys to try sending me mail
that begins ""Dear Friend"" or has a subject line that's all
uppercase and ends in eight exclamation points. I can filter
out that stuff with about one line of code. And so you do,
and in the beginning it works. A few simple rules will take
a big bite out of your incoming spam. Merely looking
for the word ""click"" will catch 79.7% of the
emails in my spam corpus, with only 1.2% false positives. I spent about six months writing software that looked for
individual spam features before I tried the statistical
approach. What I found was that recognizing that last few
percent of spams got very hard, and that as I
made the filters stricter I got more false positives. False positives are innocent emails that get mistakenly
identified as spams. For most users,
missing legitimate email is
an order of magnitude worse than receiving spam, so a
filter that yields false positives is like an acne cure
that carries a risk of death to the patient. The more spam a user gets, the less
likely he'll be to notice one innocent mail sitting in his
spam folder. And strangely enough, the better your spam filters get,
the more dangerous false positives become, because when the
filters are really good, users will be more likely to
ignore everything they catch. I don't know why I avoided trying the statistical approach
for so long.","I think it was because I got addicted to trying to identify spam features myself, as if I were playing some kind of competitive game with the spammers. (Nonhackers don't often realize this, but most hackers are very competitive.) When I did try statistical analysis, I found immediately that it was much cleverer than I had been. It discovered, of course, that terms like ""virtumundo"" and ""teens"" were good indicators of spam. But it also discovered that ""per"" and ""FL"" and ""ff0000"" are good indicators of spam. In fact, ""ff0000"" (html for bright red) turns out to be as good an indicator of spam as any pornographic term. _ _ _ Here's a sketch of how I do statistical filtering. I start with one corpus of spam and one of nonspam mail. At the moment each one has about 4000 messages in it. I scan the entire text, including headers and embedded html and javascript, of each message in each corpus. I currently consider alphanumeric characters, dashes, apostrophes, and dollar signs to be part of tokens, and everything else to be a token separator. (There is probably room for improvement here.) I ignore tokens that are all digits, and I also ignore html comments, not even considering them as token separators. I count the number of times each token (ignoring case, currently) occurs in each corpus. At this stage I end up with two large hash tables, one for each corpus, mapping tokens to number of occurrences. Next I create a third hash table, this time mapping each token to the probability that an email containing it is a spam, which I calculate as follows [1]: (let ((g (* 2 (or (gethash word good) 0))) (b (or (gethash word bad) 0))) (unless (< (+ g b) 5) (max .01 (min .99 (float (/ (min 1 (/ b nbad)) (+ (min 1 (/ g ngood)) (min 1 (/ b nbad))))))))) where word is the token whose probability we're calculating, good and bad are the hash tables I created in the first step, and ngood and nbad are the number of nonspam and spam messages respectively. I explained this as code to show a couple of important details. I want to bias the probabilities slightly to avoid false positives, and by trial and error I've found that a good way to do it is to double all the numbers in good. This helps to distinguish between words that occasionally do occur in legitimate email and words that almost never do. I only consider words that occur more than five times in total (actually, because of the doubling, occurring three times in nonspam mail would be enough). And then there is the question of what probability to assign to words that occur in one corpus but not the other. Again by trial and error I chose .01 and .99. There may be room for tuning here, but as the corpus grows such tuning will happen automatically anyway. The especially observant will notice that","Maybe I was too focused on the
individual spam features. Maybe I was too
confident in the idea that we could write a filter that could
recognize all the spam features. I was also
not aware of the Bayesian approach, and perhaps that was
part of it. I think I would have been better off not
having tried the statistical approach at all. But I
did. I think that the statistical approach is the
only way to get to the bottom of the problem. I
think that the best way to get there is to use a Bayesian
filter. So, to get started, I needed to build a Bayesian
filter. So, I started by building a Bayesian filter. So, I
started by building a Bayesian filter. I think the first step is to collect a
corpus of spam and ham. That is, emails that are spam and emails that are not. Then, for each word in the spam, we note that it is a spam word. For each word in the ham, we note that it is a ham word. Then, for any given email, we can calculate the probability that it is spam, given the words in the email. This is the core of the Bayesian approach. So, the first step is to collect a corpus of spam and ham. But how do we get that? I think the first step is to get a corpus of spam and ham. But how do we get that? That's the first problem. How can we get a corpus of spam and ham? Well, we can't get a lot of spam, but we can get a lot of ham. But we can't get a lot of ham, either. So, how do we get that? Well, we can get a lot of ham from the user's email. But the user's email is not all ham. It's a mix of spam and ham. So, perhaps we need to get a corpus of spam and ham",494,500,331,0.2336,0.3428,0.9422,0.9354,0.8909,0.7364,1.933,-4.1606,0.3325,0.3751,0.034,0.0774,0.0033,0.0082,0.5817,0.7703,0.9612,0.9758,0.4110320284697509,0.364951768488746,0.5,7,8,0.7387,0.9835,0.145748987854251,0.254,0.16012084592145015,0.8712,0.4777,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,The 18 Mistakes That Kill Startups.txt,"Want to start a startup? Get funded by
Y Combinator. October 2006
In the Q & A period after a recent talk, someone asked what made
startups fail. After standing there gaping for a few seconds I
realized this was kind of a trick question. It's equivalent to
asking how to make a startup succeed — if you avoid every cause of
failure, you succeed — and that's too big a question to answer on
the fly. Afterwards I realized it could be helpful to look at the problem
from this direction. If you have a list of all the things you
shouldn't do, you can turn that into a recipe for succeeding just
by negating. And this form of list may be more useful in practice. It's easier to catch yourself doing something you shouldn't than
always to remember to do something you should. [1]
In a sense there's just one mistake that kills startups: not making
something users want. If you make something users want, you'll
probably be fine, whatever else you do or don't do. And if you
don't make something users want, then you're dead, whatever else
you do or don't do. So really this is a list of 18 things that
cause startups not to make something users want. Nearly all failure
funnels through that. 1. Single Founder
Have you ever noticed how few successful startups were founded by
just one person? Even companies you think of as having one founder,
like Oracle, usually turn out to have more. It seems unlikely this
is a coincidence. What's wrong with having one founder? To start with, it's a vote
of no confidence. It probably means the founder couldn't talk any
of his friends into starting the company with him. That's pretty
alarming, because his friends are the ones who know him best. But even if the founder's friends were all wrong and the company
is a good bet, he's still at a disadvantage. Starting a startup
is too hard for one person. Even if you could do all the work
yourself, you need colleagues to brainstorm with, to talk you out
of stupid decisions, and to cheer you up when things go wrong. The last one might be the most important. The low points in a
startup are so low that few could bear them alone. When you have
multiple founders, esprit de corps binds them together in a way
that seems to violate conservation laws. Each thinks ""I can't let
my friends down."" This is one of the most powerful forces in human
nature, and it's missing when there's just one founder. 2. Bad Location
Startups prosper in some places and not others. Silicon Valley
dominates, then Boston, then Seattle, Austin, Denver, and New York. After
that there's not much. Even in New York the number of startups per
capita is probably a 20th of what it is in Silicon Valley. In towns
like Houston and Chicago and Detroit it's too small to measure.","Why is the falloff so sharp? Probably for the same reason it is in other industries. What's the sixth largest fashion center in the US? The sixth largest center for oil, or finance, or publishing? Whatever they are they're probably so far from the top that it would be misleading even to call them centers. It's an interesting question why cities become startup hubs, but the reason startups prosper in them is probably the same as it is for any industry: that's where the experts are. Standards are higher; people are more sympathetic to what you're doing; the kind of people you want to hire want to live there; supporting industries are there; the people you run into in chance meetings are in the same business. Who knows exactly how these factors combine to boost startups in Silicon Valley and squish them in Detroit, but it's clear they do from the number of startups per capita in each. 3. Marginal Niche Most of the groups that apply to Y Combinator suffer from a common problem: choosing a small, obscure niche in the hope of avoiding competition. If you watch little kids playing sports, you notice that below a certain age they're afraid of the ball. When the ball comes near them their instinct is to avoid it. I didn't make a lot of catches as an eight year old outfielder, because whenever a fly ball came my way, I used to close my eyes and hold my glove up more for protection than in the hope of catching it. Choosing a marginal project is the startup equivalent of my eight year old strategy for dealing with fly balls. If you make anything good, you're going to have competitors, so you may as well face that. You can only avoid competition by avoiding good ideas. I think this shrinking from big problems is mostly unconscious. It's not that people think of grand ideas but decide to pursue smaller ones because they seem safer. Your unconscious won't even let you think of grand ideas. So the solution may be to think about ideas without involving yourself. What would be a great idea for someone else to do as a startup? 4. Derivative Idea Many of the applications we get are imitations of some existing company. That's one source of ideas, but not the best. If you look at the origins of successful startups, few were started in imitation of some other startup. Where did they get their ideas? Usually from some specific, unsolved problem the founders identified. Our startup made software for making online stores. When we started it, there wasn't any; the few sites you could order from were hand-made at great expense by web consultants. We knew that if online shopping ever took off, these sites would have to be generated by software, so we wrote some. Pretty straightforward. It seems like the best problems to solve are ones that affect you personally. Apple happened because Steve Wozniak wanted a","The
reason is that startups are a form of high risk, high reward
investment, and the best investors are the people who are already
in the business of investing in startups. So the best place to
start is where the ecosystem is strongest. 3. Wrong Industry
Startups are most successful in the industries that are
growing the fastest. So if you're starting a company in a
declining industry, you're in a lot of trouble. The best time to
start a business is in a growing industry. The worst time is in a
declining one. It's not that the industry is bad, but that it's not growing.
The best time to start a company is when the industry is growing
fast and the market is expanding. 4. Wrong Product
This is the most important mistake. If you make something
users don't want, you're dead. The most important thing for a
startup is to build something that users want. If you can't do that
within the first 3 months, you're not going to be successful. If you
can do it, then everything else is easier. 5. Wrong Timing
Timing is important, but not the one you might think. The
most important timing is not when the product is ready, but when
the market is ready. If the market is not ready, the product is
not ready. So the most important thing is to make sure that the
market is ready when you launch. The best way to know that is to
build a minimum viable product and test the market. 6. Wrong Market
This is a very subtle mistake. If the market is too big, you
can't serve it. If it's too small, you can't serve it. You need to find a
market that's just right. The right market is the one that has
a demand that is large enough to sustain the company, but not so",499,500,315,0.1979,0.1944,0.9701,0.9494,0.9238,0.8417,1.1869,-2.2778,0.3825,0.384,0.0421,0.0731,0.0105,0.0139,0.3497,0.4492,0.9739,0.9406,0.4415807560137457,0.4452296819787986,0.48066298342541436,8,7,0.9776,0.9833,0.17034068136272545,0.138,0.1619047619047619,0.8637,0.6104,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,Can You Buy a Silicon Valley_  Maybe..txt,"February 2009
A lot of cities look at Silicon Valley and ask ""How could we make
something like that happen here?"" The
organic way to do it is to
establish a first-rate university in a place where rich people want
to live. That's how Silicon Valley happened. But could you shortcut
the process by funding startups? Possibly. Let's consider what it would take. The first thing to understand is that encouraging startups is a
different problem from encouraging startups in a particular city. The latter is much more expensive. People sometimes think they could improve the startup scene in their
town by starting something like Y
Combinator there, but in fact it
will have near zero effect. I know because Y Combinator itself had
near zero effect on Boston when we were based there half the year. The people we funded came from all over the country (indeed, the
world) and afterward they went wherever they could get more
funding—which generally meant Silicon Valley. The seed funding business is not a regional business, because at
that stage startups are mobile. They're just a couple founders with
laptops. [1]
If you want to encourage startups in a particular city, you have
to fund startups that won't leave. There are two ways to do that:
have rules preventing them from leaving, or fund them at the point
in their life when they naturally take root. The first approach
is a mistake, because it becomes a filter for selecting bad startups. If your terms force startups to do things they don't want to, only
the desperate ones will take your money. Good startups will move to another city as a condition of funding. What they won't do is agree not to move the next time they need
funding. So the only way to get them to stay is to give them enough
that they never need to leave. ___
How much would that take? If you want to keep startups from leaving
your town, you have to give them enough that they're not tempted
by an offer from Silicon Valley VCs that requires them to move. A
startup would be able to refuse such an offer if they had grown to
the point where they were (a) rooted in your town and/or (b) so
successful that VCs would fund them even if they didn't move. How much would it cost to grow a startup to that point? A minimum
of several hundred thousand dollars. Wufoo
seem to have rooted
themselves in Tampa on $118k, but they're an extreme case. On
average it would take at least half a million. So if it seems too good to be true to think you could grow a local
silicon valley by giving startups $15-20k each like Y Combinator,
that's because it is. To make them stick around you'd have to give
them at least 20 times that much. However, even that is an interesting prospect.","Suppose to be on the safe side it would cost a million dollars per startup. If you could get startups to stick to your town for a million apiece, then for a billion dollars you could bring in a thousand startups. That probably wouldn't push you past Silicon Valley itself, but it might get you second place. For the price of a football stadium, any town that was decent to live in could make itself one of the biggest startup hubs in the world. What's more, it wouldn't take very long. You could probably do it in five years. During the term of one mayor. And it would get easier over time, because the more startups you had in town, the less it would take to get new ones to move there. By the time you had a thousand startups in town, the VCs wouldn't be trying so hard to get them to move to Silicon Valley; instead they'd be opening local offices. Then you'd really be in good shape. You'd have started a self-sustaining chain reaction like the one that drives the Valley. ___ But now comes the hard part. You have to pick the startups. How do you do that? Picking startups is a rare and valuable skill, and the handful of people who have it are not readily hireable. And this skill is so hard to measure that if a government did try to hire people with it, they'd almost certainly get the wrong ones. For example, a city could give money to a VC fund to establish a local branch, and let them make the choices. But only a bad VC fund would take that deal. They wouldn't seem bad to the city officials. They'd seem very impressive. But they'd be bad at picking startups. That's the characteristic failure mode of VCs. All VCs look impressive to limited partners. The difference between the good ones and the bad ones only becomes visible in the other half of their jobs: choosing and advising startups. [2] What you really want is a pool of local angel investors—people investing money they made from their own startups. But unfortunately you run into a chicken and egg problem here. If your city isn't already a startup hub, there won't be people there who got rich from startups. And there is no way I can think of that a city could attract angels from outside. By definition they're rich. There's no incentive that would make them move. [3] However, a city could select startups by piggybacking on the expertise of investors who weren't local. It would be pretty straightforward to make a list of the most eminent Silicon Valley angels and from that to generate a list of all the startups they'd invested in. If a city offered these companies a million dollars each to move, a lot of the earlier stage ones would probably take it. Preposterous as this plan sounds, it's probably the most efficient way a city could select","If you could do it, it would be a huge win. But the problem is that this is not how the market works. The market is not going to give you the money for this. If you want to do this, you have to raise the money yourself. So the conclusion is: you can't just start a Y Combinator in a
city and expect to get a lot of startups to stay. It's not going to happen. The only way to get startups to stay is to give them enough that
they don't need to leave. So the only real solution is to have a first-rate university in the city.

Paul Graham,The Hardest Lessons for Startups to Learn.txt,"April 2006
(This essay is derived from a talk at the 2006
Startup School.)
The startups we've funded so far are pretty quick, but they seem
quicker to learn some lessons than others. I think it's because
some things about startups are kind of counterintuitive. We've now
invested
in enough companies that I've learned a trick
for determining which points are the counterintuitive ones:
they're the ones I have to keep repeating. So I'm going to number these points, and maybe with future startups
I'll be able to pull off a form of Huffman coding. I'll make them
all read this, and then instead of nagging them in detail, I'll
just be able to say: number four! 1. Release Early. The thing I probably repeat most is this recipe for a startup: get
a version 1 out fast, then improve it based on users' reactions. By ""release early"" I don't mean you should release something full
of bugs, but that you should release something minimal. Users hate
bugs, but they don't seem to mind a minimal version 1, if there's
more coming soon. There are several reasons it pays to get version 1 done fast. One
is that this is simply the right way to write software, whether for
a startup or not. I've been repeating that since 1993, and I haven't seen much since to
contradict it. I've seen a lot of startups die because they were
too slow to release stuff, and none because they were too quick. [1]
One of the things that will surprise you if you build something
popular is that you won't know your users. Reddit now has almost half a million
unique visitors a month. Who are all those people? They have no
idea. No web startup does. And since you don't know your users,
it's dangerous to guess what they'll like. Better to release
something and let them tell you. Wufoo took this to heart and released
their form-builder before the underlying database. You can't even
drive the thing yet, but 83,000 people came to sit in the driver's
seat and hold the steering wheel. And Wufoo got valuable feedback
from it: Linux users complained they used too much Flash, so they
rewrote their software not to. If they'd waited to release everything
at once, they wouldn't have discovered this problem till it was
more deeply wired in. Even if you had no users, it would still be important to release
quickly, because for a startup the initial release acts as a shakedown
cruise. If anything major is broken-- if the idea's no good,
for example, or the founders hate one another-- the stress of getting
that first version out will expose it. And if you have such problems
you want to find them early. Perhaps the most important reason to release early, though, is that
it makes you work harder. When you're working on something that
isn't released, problems are intriguing. In something that's out
there, problems are alarming.","There is a lot more urgency once you release. And I think that's precisely why people put it off. They know they'll have to work a lot harder once they do. [2] 2. Keep Pumping Out Features. Of course, ""release early"" has a second component, without which it would be bad advice. If you're going to start with something that doesn't do much, you better improve it fast. What I find myself repeating is ""pump out features."" And this rule isn't just for the initial stages. This is something all startups should do for as long as they want to be considered startups. I don't mean, of course, that you should make your application ever more complex. By ""feature"" I mean one unit of hacking-- one quantum of making users' lives better. As with exercise, improvements beget improvements. If you run every day, you'll probably feel like running tomorrow. But if you skip running for a couple weeks, it will be an effort to drag yourself out. So it is with hacking: the more ideas you implement, the more ideas you'll have. You should make your system better at least in some small way every day or two. This is not just a good way to get development done; it is also a form of marketing. Users love a site that's constantly improving. In fact, users expect a site to improve. Imagine if you visited a site that seemed very good, and then returned two months later and not one thing had changed. Wouldn't it start to seem lame? [3] They'll like you even better when you improve in response to their comments, because customers are used to companies ignoring them. If you're the rare exception-- a company that actually listens-- you'll generate fanatical loyalty. You won't need to advertise, because your users will do it for you. This seems obvious too, so why do I have to keep repeating it? I think the problem here is that people get used to how things are. Once a product gets past the stage where it has glaring flaws, you start to get used to it, and gradually whatever features it happens to have become its identity. For example, I doubt many people at Yahoo (or Google for that matter) realized how much better web mail could be till Paul Buchheit showed them. I think the solution is to assume that anything you've made is far short of what it could be. Force yourself, as a sort of intellectual exercise, to keep thinking of improvements. Ok, sure, what you have is perfect. But if you had to change something, what would it be? If your product seems finished, there are two possible explanations: (a) it is finished, or (b) you lack imagination. Experience suggests (b) is a thousand times more likely. 3. Make Users Happy. Improving constantly is an instance of a more general rule: make users happy. One thing all startups have in common is that they can't force anyone to","When you're working on something that's out there, you
have to solve problems in a way that's more urgent. When you're working on something that's not released, you can be
more exploratory. So when you release early, you get to have the
exploratory phase happen in the early phase, and then the
urgent phase happens later. So the release early is a way of getting more done. So I think the release early is the most important
principle for a startup. 2. Build the Right Thing. The second thing I want to talk about is the idea that you have to
build the right thing. I don't mean to be too vague, but it's not just about building
something that's popular, but building something that is
valuable. If you're building something that's popular but not valuable,
you might get a lot of users, but you'll have a hard time
making money. But if you're building something that's valuable, you might
get few users, but you'll have a lot of money. So the question is: what is valuable? That's the question we should be asking. But how do we know what's valuable? Well, the answer is: the people who are going to be using it. So the people who are going to be using it are the ones who
can tell you what's valuable. So, if you're building a product, you have to go to the people
who are going to be using it. So, if you're building a product for customers, you have to go
to the customers. If you're building a product for employees, you have to go to the
employees. If you're building a product for a government, you have to go
to the government. So, in order to know what's valuable, you have to go to the people
who are going to be using it.

Paul Graham,The Reddits.txt,"March 2024
I met the Reddits before we even started Y Combinator. In fact they
were one of the reasons we started it. YC grew out of a talk I gave to the Harvard Computer Society (the
undergrad computer club) about how to start a startup. Everyone
else in the audience was probably local, but Steve and Alexis came
up on the train from the University of Virginia, where they were
seniors. Since they'd come so far I agreed to meet them for coffee. They told me about the startup idea we'd later fund them to drop:
a way to order fast food on your cellphone. This was before smartphones. They'd have had to make deals with
cell carriers and fast food chains just to get it launched. So it
was not going to happen. It still doesn't exist, 19 years later. But I was impressed with their brains and their energy. In fact I
was so impressed with them and some of the other people I met at
that talk that I decided to start something to fund them. A few
days later I told Steve and Alexis that we were starting Y Combinator,
and encouraged them to apply. That first batch we didn't have any way to identify applicants, so
we made up nicknames for them. The Reddits were the ""Cell food
muffins."" ""Muffin"" is a term of endearment Jessica uses for things
like small dogs and two year olds. So that gives you some idea what
kind of impression Steve and Alexis made in those days. They had
the look of slightly ruffled surprise that baby birds have. Their idea was bad though. And since we thought then that we were
funding ideas rather than founders, we rejected them. But we felt
bad about it. Jessica was sad that we'd rejected the muffins. And
it seemed wrong to me to turn down the people we'd been inspired
to start YC to fund. I don't think the startup sense of the word ""pivot"" had been invented
yet, but we wanted to fund Steve and Alexis, so if their idea was
bad, they'd have to work on something else. And I knew what else. In those days there was a site called Delicious where you could
save links. It had a page called del.icio.us/popular that listed
the most-saved links, and people were using this page as a de facto
Reddit. I knew because a lot of the traffic to my site was coming
from it. There needed to be something like del.icio.us/popular, but
designed for sharing links instead of being a byproduct of saving
them. So I called Steve and Alexis and said that we liked them, just not
their idea, so we'd fund them if they'd work on something else. They were on the train home to Virginia at that point.","They got off at the next station and got on the next train north, and by the end of the day were committed to working on what's now called Reddit. They would have liked to call it Snoo, as in ""What snoo?"" But snoo.com was too expensive, so they settled for calling the mascot Snoo and picked a name for the site that wasn't registered. Early on Reddit was just a provisional name, or so they told me at least, but it's probably too late to change it now. As with all the really great startups, there's an uncannily close match between the company and the founders. Steve in particular. Reddit has a certain personality — curious, skeptical, ready to be amused — and that personality is Steve's. Steve will roll his eyes at this, but he's an intellectual; he's interested in ideas for their own sake. That was how he came to be in that audience in Cambridge in the first place. He knew me because he was interested in a programming language I've written about called Lisp, and Lisp is one of those languages few people learn except out of intellectual curiosity. Steve's kind of vacuum-cleaner curiosity is exactly what you want when you're starting a site that's a list of links to literally anything interesting. Steve was not a big fan of authority, so he also liked the idea of a site without editors. In those days the top forum for programmers was a site called Slashdot. It was a lot like Reddit, except the stories on the frontpage were chosen by human moderators. And though they did a good job, that one small difference turned out to be a big difference. Being driven by user submissions meant Reddit was fresher than Slashdot. News there was newer, and users will always go where the newest news is. I pushed the Reddits to launch fast. A version one didn't need to be more than a couple hundred lines of code. How could that take more than a week or two to build? And they did launch comparatively fast, about three weeks into the first YC batch. The first users were Steve, Alexis, me, and some of their YC batchmates and college friends. It turns out you don't need that many users to collect a decent list of interesting links, especially if you have multiple accounts per user. Reddit got two more people from their YC batch: Chris Slowe and Aaron Swartz, and they too were unusually smart. Chris was just finishing his PhD in physics at Harvard. Aaron was younger, a college freshman, and even more anti-authority than Steve. It's not exaggerating to describe him as a martyr for what authority later did to him. Slowly but inexorably Reddit's traffic grew. At first the numbers were so small they were hard to distinguish from background noise. But within a few weeks it was clear that there was a core of real users returning regularly to the site. And","I don't know if they were surprised or not, but they said yes.
They came to San Francisco, and we started the first batch of YC
startups. The Reddits were the first YC founders. The first YC startups were the Reddits. That's how it all began. And I think that's why it's called YC. Because the Reddits were the first. So I think the name YC comes from the Reddits, even if the first
startup wasn't called Reddit. (This is the only part of the story that I don't remember, so I'm not
sure if it's accurate.) 

So that's the story of how Y Combinator got its name. The first startup was the Reddits, and the name YC is from the Reddits. The first startup wasn't called Reddit, but it was the Reddits. The name YC comes from the Reddits, even if the first startup wasn't called Reddit. 

But in reality, the first startup that YC funded was actually called Reddit. The Reddits were the first founders, but the first startup was called Reddit. The name YC comes from the Reddits, but the first startup was called Reddit. So that's the story. The name YC comes from the Reddits, but the first startup was called Reddit. 

So, the name YC comes from the Reddits, and the first startup was called Reddit. 

That's the story. The name YC comes from the Reddits, and the first startup was called Reddit. 

So, the name YC comes from the Reddits, and the first startup was called Reddit.

Paul Graham,"It's Charisma, Stupid.txt","November 2004, corrected June 2006
Occam's razor says we should prefer the simpler of two explanations. I begin by reminding readers of this principle because I'm about
to propose a theory that will offend both liberals and conservatives. But Occam's razor means, in effect, that if you want to disagree
with it, you have a hell of a coincidence to explain. Theory: In US presidential elections, the more
charismatic candidate wins. People who write about politics, whether on the left or the right,
have a consistent bias: they take politics seriously. When one
candidate beats another they look for political explanations. The
country is shifting to the left, or the right. And that sort of
shift can certainly be the result of a presidential election, which
makes it easy to believe it was the cause. But when I think about why I voted for Clinton over the first George
Bush, it wasn't because I was shifting to the left. Clinton just
seemed more dynamic. He seemed to want the job more. Bush seemed
old and tired. I suspect it was the same for a lot of voters. Clinton didn't represent any national shift leftward. [1]
He was
just more charismatic than George Bush or (God help us) Bob Dole. In 2000 we practically got a controlled experiment to prove it:
Gore had Clinton's policies, but not his charisma, and he suffered
proportionally. [2]
Same story in 2004. Kerry was smarter and more
articulate than Bush, but rather a stiff. And Kerry lost. As I looked further back, I kept finding the same pattern. Pundits said Carter beat Ford
because the country distrusted the Republicans after Watergate. And yet it also happened that Carter was famous for his big grin
and folksy ways, and Ford for being a boring klutz. Four years
later, pundits said the country had lurched to the right. But
Reagan, a former actor, also happened to be even more charismatic
than Carter (whose grin was somewhat less cheery after four stressful
years in office). In 1984 the charisma gap between Reagan and
Mondale was like that between Clinton and Dole, with similar results. The first George Bush managed to win in 1988, though he would later
be vanquished by one of the most charismatic presidents ever, because
in 1988 he was up against the notoriously uncharismatic
Michael Dukakis. These are the elections I remember personally, but apparently the
same pattern played out in 1964 and 1972. The most recent
counterexample appears to be 1968, when Nixon beat the more charismatic Hubert
Humphrey. But when you examine that election, it tends to support
the charisma theory more than contradict it. As Joe McGinnis
recounts in his famous book The Selling of the President 1968,
Nixon knew he had less charisma than Humphrey, and thus simply
refused to debate him on TV. He knew he couldn't afford to let the
two of them be seen side by side. Now a candidate probably couldn't get away with refusing to debate.","But in 1968 the custom of televised debates was still evolving. In effect, Nixon won in 1968 because voters were never allowed to see the real Nixon. All they saw were carefully scripted campaign spots. Oddly enough, the most recent true counterexample is probably 1960. Though this election is usually given as an example of the power of TV, Kennedy apparently would not have won without fraud by party machines in Illinois and Texas. But TV was still young in 1960; only 87% of households had it. [3] Undoubtedly TV helped Kennedy, so historians are correct in regarding this election as a watershed. TV required a new kind of candidate. There would be no more Calvin Coolidges. The charisma theory may also explain why Democrats tend to lose presidential elections. The core of the Democrats' ideology seems to be a belief in government. Perhaps this tends to attract people who are earnest, but dull. Dukakis, Gore, and Kerry were so similar in that respect that they might have been brothers. Good thing for the Democrats that their screen lets through an occasional Clinton, even if some scandal results. [4] One would like to believe elections are won and lost on issues, if only fake ones like Willie Horton. And yet, if they are, we have a remarkable coincidence to explain. In every presidential election since TV became widespread, the apparently more charismatic candidate has won. Surprising, isn't it, that voters' opinions on the issues have lined up with charisma for 11 elections in a row? The political commentators who come up with shifts to the left or right in their morning-after analyses are like the financial reporters stuck writing stories day after day about the random fluctuations of the stock market. Day ends, market closes up or down, reporter looks for good or bad news respectively, and writes that the market was up on news of Intel's earnings, or down on fears of instability in the Middle East. Suppose we could somehow feed these reporters false information about market closes, but give them all the other news intact. Does anyone believe they would notice the anomaly, and not simply write that stocks were up (or down) on whatever good (or bad) news there was that day? That they would say, hey, wait a minute, how can stocks be up with all this unrest in the Middle East? I'm not saying that issues don't matter to voters. Of course they do. But the major parties know so well which issues matter how much to how many voters, and adjust their message so precisely in response, that they tend to split the difference on the issues, leaving the election to be decided by the one factor they can't control: charisma. If the Democrats had been running a candidate as charismatic as Clinton in the 2004 election, he'd have won. And we'd be reading that the election was a referendum on the war in Iraq, instead of that the Democrats are out of","But in 1968, the rules were different. So that was a
case of charisma, not of strategy. [3]
In the end, the theory of charisma is not so different from the
theory of political ideology. The most charismatic candidate is more
likely to be from the more popular party. So, in the long run, the country doesn't shift. The country doesn't change. The country just keeps
choosing the more charismatic candidate. And that's why
the same candidate tends to win again and again. [4]
So, if you think the country is shifting to the left or to the right, you might be
mistaken. It's not shifting. It's just that the candidates are shifting. And that's why
the same people are winning again and again. [5]
In fact, the country is not shifting, but the candidates are. And that's why the same
people win again and again. The country is not changing, but the candidates are. And that's why the same people win again and again. [6]
Wait, that's a bit redundant. I'm sorry. But that's the point. So, the
same people win again and again. [7]
So, what's the point? Well, the point is that if you think the country is shifting, you're wrong. If you think the country is stable, you're also wrong. It's not stable, but it's not shifting. It's just that the candidates are shifting. [8]
So, if you want to know the future, you have to look at the candidates. [9]
So, the conclusion is that the country isn't shifting, but the candidates are. And that's why the same people win again and again. [10]
So, the country is not shifting, but the candidates are. And that's why the same people win again and again. [11]

Paul Graham,How to Raise Money.txt,"Want to start a startup? Get funded by
Y Combinator. September 2013
Most startups that raise money do it more than once. A typical
trajectory might be (1) to get started with a few tens of thousands
from something like Y Combinator or individual angels, then
(2) raise a few hundred thousand to a few million to build the company,
and then (3) once the company is clearly succeeding, raise one or
more later rounds to accelerate growth. Reality can be messier. Some companies raise money twice in phase
2. Others skip phase 1 and go straight to phase 2. And at Y Combinator
we get an increasing number of companies that have already
raised amounts in the hundreds of thousands. But the three phase
path is at least the one about which individual startups' paths
oscillate. This essay focuses on phase 2 fundraising. That's the type the
startups we fund are doing on Demo Day, and this essay is the advice
we give them. Forces
Fundraising is hard in both senses: hard like lifting a heavy weight,
and hard like solving a puzzle. It's hard like lifting a weight
because it's intrinsically hard to convince people to part with
large sums of money. That problem is irreducible; it should be
hard. But much of the other kind of difficulty can be eliminated. Fundraising only seems a puzzle because it's an alien world to most
founders, and I hope to fix that by supplying a map through it. To founders, the behavior of investors is often opaque — partly
because their motivations are obscure, but partly because they
deliberately mislead you. And the misleading ways of investors
combine horribly with the wishful thinking of inexperienced founders. At YC we're always warning founders about this danger, and investors
are probably more circumspect with YC startups than with other
companies they talk to, and even so we witness a constant series
of explosions as these two volatile components combine. [1]
If you're an inexperienced founder, the only way to survive is by
imposing external constraints on yourself. You can't trust your
intuitions. I'm going to give you a set of rules here that will
get you through this process if anything will. At certain moments
you'll be tempted to ignore them. So rule number zero is: these
rules exist for a reason. You wouldn't need a rule to keep you
going in one direction if there weren't powerful forces pushing you
in another. The ultimate source of the forces acting on you are the forces
acting on investors. Investors are pinched between two kinds of
fear: fear of investing in startups that fizzle, and fear of missing
out on startups that take off. The cause of all this fear is the
very thing that makes startups such attractive investments: the
successful ones grow very fast. But that fast growth means investors
can't wait around. If you wait till a startup is obviously a
success, it's too late.","To get the really high returns, you have to invest in startups when it's still unclear how they'll do. But that in turn makes investors nervous they're about to invest in a flop. As indeed they often are. What investors would like to do, if they could, is wait. When a startup is only a few months old, every week that passes gives you significantly more information about them. But if you wait too long, other investors might take the deal away from you. And of course the other investors are all subject to the same forces. So what tends to happen is that they all wait as long as they can, then when some act the rest have to. Don't raise money unless you want it and it wants you. Such a high proportion of successful startups raise money that it might seem fundraising is one of the defining qualities of a startup. Actually it isn't. Rapid growth is what makes a company a startup. Most companies in a position to grow rapidly find that (a) taking outside money helps them grow faster, and (b) their growth potential makes it easy to attract such money. It's so common for both (a) and (b) to be true of a successful startup that practically all do raise outside money. But there may be cases where a startup either wouldn't want to grow faster, or outside money wouldn't help them to, and if you're one of them, don't raise money. The other time not to raise money is when you won't be able to. If you try to raise money before you can convince investors, you'll not only waste your time, but also burn your reputation with those investors. Be in fundraising mode or not. One of the things that surprises founders most about fundraising is how distracting it is. When you start fundraising, everything else grinds to a halt. The problem is not the time fundraising consumes but that it becomes the top idea in your mind. A startup can't endure that level of distraction for long. An early stage startup grows mostly because the founders make it grow, and if the founders look away, growth usually drops sharply. Because fundraising is so distracting, a startup should either be in fundraising mode or not. And when you do decide to raise money, you should focus your whole attention on it so you can get it done quickly and get back to work. [2] You can take money from investors when you're not in fundraising mode. You just can't expend any attention on it. There are two things that take attention: convincing investors, and negotiating with them. So when you're not in fundraising mode, you should take money from investors only if they require no convincing, and are willing to invest on terms you'll take without negotiation. For example, if a reputable investor is willing to invest on a convertible note, using standard paperwork, that is either uncapped or capped at a","So the whole idea is to get a
startups to be successful enough to attract investment, but not
yet. So that the investor can get in early and have a chance to
share in the success, but not be stuck with the failure. This is a very important point. You can't wait until the
startups are obviously successful. That's when you have to
raise money. The question is, how to get a startup to be successful
enough to attract investment. That is, how to get the startup
to be successful enough that investors are willing to invest in it
now. That is, how to get the startup to be successful enough that
investors are willing to invest in it now. That is, how to get the startup to be successful enough that
investors are willing to invest in it now. That's the main point of this essay. Now, the question is, how do you do that? The answer is: do what you're already doing. You're already doing things that are working. That's the secret to success. [2] So, the key is to get the startup to be successful enough that
investors are willing to invest in it now. The way to do that is to continue doing what you're already doing.
So, for example, if your startup is a social network, and you're
already growing users at a good rate, then you don't need to do
anything else. You just need to keep growing users. You just need to keep growing users. You just need to keep growing users. [3] So, in this case, the startup is already doing something that's
working. The key is to continue doing what's working. The secret is to keep doing what you're already doing. This is the crux of the matter. So, the problem is not that you don't have enough
money. It's that you don't have enough investors.

Paul Graham,Holding a Program in One's Head.txt,"August 2007
A good programmer working intensively on his own code can hold it
in his mind the way a mathematician holds a problem he's working
on. Mathematicians don't answer questions by working them out on
paper the way schoolchildren are taught to. They do more in their
heads: they try to understand a problem space well enough that they
can walk around it the way you can walk around the memory of the
house you grew up in. At its best programming is the same. You
hold the whole program in your head, and you can manipulate it at
will. That's particularly valuable at the start of a project, because
initially the most important thing is to be able to change what
you're doing. Not just to solve the problem in a different way,
but to change the problem you're solving. Your code is your understanding of the problem you're exploring. So it's only when you have your code in your head that you really
understand the problem. It's not easy to get a program into your head. If you leave a
project for a few months, it can take days to really understand it
again when you return to it. Even when you're actively working on
a program it can take half an hour to load into your head when you
start work each day. And that's in the best case. Ordinary
programmers working in typical office conditions never enter this
mode. Or to put it more dramatically, ordinary programmers working
in typical office conditions never really understand the problems
they're solving. Even the best programmers don't always have the whole program they're
working on loaded into their heads. But there are things you can
do to help:
Avoid distractions. Distractions are bad for many types of work,
but especially bad for programming, because programmers tend to
operate at the limit of the detail they can handle. The danger of a distraction depends not on how long it is, but
on how much it scrambles your brain. A programmer can leave the
office and go and get a sandwich without losing the code in his
head. But the wrong kind of interruption can wipe your brain
in 30 seconds. Oddly enough, scheduled distractions may be worse than unscheduled
ones. If you know you have a meeting in an hour, you don't even
start working on something hard. Work in long stretches. Since there's a fixed cost each time
you start working on a program, it's more efficient to work in
a few long sessions than many short ones. There will of course
come a point where you get stupid because you're tired. This
varies from person to person. I've heard of people hacking for
36 hours straight, but the most I've ever been able to manage
is about 18, and I work best in chunks of no more than 12. The optimum is not the limit you can physically endure.","There's an advantage as well as a cost of breaking up a project. Sometimes when you return to a problem after a rest, you find your unconscious mind has left an answer waiting for you. Use succinct languages. More powerful programming languages make programs shorter. And programmers seem to think of programs at least partially in the language they're using to write them. The more succinct the language, the shorter the program, and the easier it is to load and keep in your head. You can magnify the effect of a powerful language by using a style called bottom-up programming, where you write programs in multiple layers, the lower ones acting as programming languages for those above. If you do this right, you only have to keep the topmost layer in your head. Keep rewriting your program. Rewriting a program often yields a cleaner design. But it would have advantages even if it didn't: you have to understand a program completely to rewrite it, so there is no better way to get one loaded into your head. Write rereadable code. All programmers know it's good to write readable code. But you yourself are the most important reader. Especially in the beginning; a prototype is a conversation with yourself. And when writing for yourself you have different priorities. If you're writing for other people, you may not want to make code too dense. Some parts of a program may be easiest to read if you spread things out, like an introductory textbook. Whereas if you're writing code to make it easy to reload into your head, it may be best to go for brevity. Work in small groups. When you manipulate a program in your head, your vision tends to stop at the edge of the code you own. Other parts you don't understand as well, and more importantly, can't take liberties with. So the smaller the number of programmers, the more completely a project can mutate. If there's just one programmer, as there often is at first, you can do all-encompassing redesigns. Don't have multiple people editing the same piece of code. You never understand other people's code as well as your own. No matter how thoroughly you've read it, you've only read it, not written it. So if a piece of code is written by multiple authors, none of them understand it as well as a single author would. And of course you can't safely redesign something other people are working on. It's not just that you'd have to ask permission. You don't even let yourself think of such things. Redesigning code with several authors is like changing laws; redesigning code you alone control is like seeing the other interpretation of an ambiguous image. If you want to put several people to work on a project, divide it into components and give each to one person. Start small. A program gets easier to hold in your head as you become familiar with it. You can start to treat parts","It's the limit you can maintain without
getting tired. The main point is to work in one stretch at a time. If you start working on a task, and then
get distracted, you have to start over again. So it's better to
get into the flow of work, and then keep going. If you can't, then
it's better to get into the flow and then stop. The best way to do this is to do a long, deep, focused session
with no interruptions. The more you can do this, the better. There's a lot more to say about this, but I'll stop here.

Paul Graham,After Credentials.txt,"December 2008
A few months ago I read a New York Times article on South
Korean cram schools that said
Admission to the right university can make or break an ambitious
young South Korean. A parent added:
""In our country, college entrance exams determine 70 to 80 percent
of a person's future.""
It was striking how old fashioned this sounded. And
yet when I was in high school it wouldn't have seemed too far off
as a description of the US. Which means things must have been
changing here. The course of people's lives in the US now seems to be determined
less by credentials and more by performance than it was 25 years
ago. Where you go to college still matters, but not like it used
to. What happened? _____
Judging people by their academic credentials was in its time an
advance. The practice seems to have begun in China, where starting
in 587 candidates for the imperial civil service had to take an
exam on classical literature. [1] It was also a test of wealth,
because the knowledge it tested was so specialized that passing
required years of expensive training. But though wealth was a
necessary condition for passing, it was not a sufficient one. By
the standards of the rest of the world in 587, the Chinese system
was very enlightened. Europeans didn't introduce formal civil
service exams till the nineteenth century, and even then they seem
to have been influenced by the Chinese example. Before credentials, government positions were obtained mainly by
family influence, if not outright bribery. It was a great step
forward to judge people by their performance on a test. But by no
means a perfect solution. When you judge people that way, you tend
to get cram schools—which they did in Ming China and nineteenth
century England just as much as in present day South Korea. What cram schools are, in effect, is leaks in a seal. The use of
credentials
was an attempt to seal off the direct transmission of power between
generations, and cram schools represent that power finding holes
in the seal. Cram schools turn wealth in one generation into
credentials in the next. It's hard to beat this phenomenon, because the schools adjust to suit
whatever the tests measure. When the tests are narrow and
predictable, you get cram schools on the classic model, like those
that prepared candidates for Sandhurst (the British West Point) or
the classes American students take now to improve their SAT scores. But as the tests get broader, the schools do too. Preparing a
candidate for the Chinese imperial civil service exams took years,
as prep school does today. But the raison d'etre of all these
institutions has been the same: to beat the system. [2]
_____
History suggests that, all other things being equal, a society
prospers in proportion to its ability to prevent parents from
influencing their children's success directly.","It's a fine thing for parents to help their children indirectly—for example, by helping them to become smarter or more disciplined, which then makes them more successful. The problem comes when parents use direct methods: when they are able to use their own wealth or power as a substitute for their children's qualities. Parents will tend to do this when they can. Parents will die for their kids, so it's not surprising to find they'll also push their scruples to the limits for them. Especially if other parents are doing it. Sealing off this force has a double advantage. Not only does a society get ""the best man for the job,"" but parents' ambitions are diverted from direct methods to indirect ones—to actually trying to raise their kids well. But we should expect it to be very hard to contain parents' efforts to obtain an unfair advantage for their kids. We're dealing with one of the most powerful forces in human nature. We shouldn't expect naive solutions to work, any more than we'd expect naive solutions for keeping heroin out of a prison to work. _____ The obvious way to solve the problem is to make credentials better. If the tests a society uses are currently hackable, we can study the way people beat them and try to plug the holes. You can use the cram schools to show you where most of the holes are. They also tell you when you're succeeding in fixing them: when cram schools become less popular. A more general solution would be to push for increased transparency, especially at critical social bottlenecks like college admissions. In the US this process still shows many outward signs of corruption. For example, legacy admissions. The official story is that legacy status doesn't carry much weight, because all it does is break ties: applicants are bucketed by ability, and legacy status is only used to decide between the applicants in the bucket that straddles the cutoff. But what this means is that a university can make legacy status have as much or as little weight as they want, by adjusting the size of the bucket that straddles the cutoff. By gradually chipping away at the abuse of credentials, you could probably make them more airtight. But what a long fight it would be. Especially when the institutions administering the tests don't really want them to be airtight. _____ Fortunately there's a better way to prevent the direct transmission of power between generations. Instead of trying to make credentials harder to hack, we can also make them matter less. Let's think about what credentials are for. What they are, functionally, is a way of predicting performance. If you could measure actual performance, you wouldn't need them. So why did they even evolve? Why haven't we just been measuring actual performance? Think about where credentialism first appeared: in selecting candidates for large organizations. Individual performance is hard to measure in large organizations, and the harder performance is to measure, the","The more a society
can do this, the more it can be said to be in the process of
modernizing. The Chinese civil service exams were a step in that
direction. The SATs and other tests are also steps in that
direction. The idea is that the system will be more fair and more
efficient if people are judged by their ability to perform rather
than by their ability to get the right connections. But the
problem is that the system can't be perfect. It's not that the
system is corrupt, but that it's not perfect. So even if a system
is fair, it's not necessarily efficient. The system might
overcompensate in some areas and undercompensate in others. It might
be that a person who is not particularly bright but who is very
hardworking is given the same chance as a person who is very bright
but not very hardworking. The system might not be able to tell the
difference between a person who is naturally talented and one who
has learned to be talented through effort. So, in the end, the
system might not be the best way to make people more productive.
But the point is not to say that the system is corrupt. The point
is that it's not perfect, and that the best way to improve the
system is to improve the test. [3]
[1] The system is sometimes called the imperial examination system. The Chinese
civil service exams, which began in 604, were the most famous.
[2] The word ""preparation"" is used in a loose sense here. It
might be more accurate to say ""preparation for the test,"" but I
have used ""preparation"" to mean both in this text. [3] This is a
very complex and debated subject, and I'm not claiming to have
all the answers.

Paul Graham,How Not to Die.txt,"Want to start a startup? Get funded by
Y Combinator. August 2007
(This is a talk I gave at the last
Y Combinator dinner of the summer. Usually we don't have a speaker at the last dinner; it's more of
a party. But it seemed worth spoiling the atmosphere if I could
save some of the startups from
preventable deaths. So at the last minute I cooked up this rather
grim talk. I didn't mean this as an essay; I wrote it down
because I only had two hours before dinner and think fastest while
writing.)
A couple days ago I told a reporter that we expected about a third
of the companies we funded to succeed. Actually I was being
conservative. I'm hoping it might be as much as a half. Wouldn't
it be amazing if we could achieve a 50% success rate? Another way of saying that is that half of you are going to die. Phrased
that way, it doesn't sound good at all. In fact, it's kind of weird
when you think about it, because our definition of success is that
the founders get rich. If half the startups we fund succeed, then
half of you are going to get rich and the other half are going to
get nothing. If you can just avoid dying, you get rich. That sounds like a joke,
but it's actually a pretty good description of what happens in a
typical startup. It certainly describes what happened in Viaweb. We avoided dying till we got rich. It was really close, too. When we were visiting Yahoo to talk about
being acquired, we had to interrupt everything and borrow one of
their conference rooms to talk down an investor who was about to
back out of a new funding round we needed to stay alive. So even
in the middle of getting rich we were fighting off the grim reaper. You may have heard that quote about luck consisting of opportunity
meeting preparation. You've now done the preparation. The work
you've done so far has, in effect, put you in a position to get
lucky: you can now get rich by not letting your company die. That's
more than most people have. So let's talk about how not to die. We've done this five times now, and we've seen a bunch of startups
die. About 10 of them so far. We don't know exactly what happens
when they die, because they generally don't die loudly and heroically. Mostly they crawl off somewhere and die. For us the main indication of impending doom is when we don't hear
from you. When we haven't heard from, or about, a startup for a
couple months, that's a bad sign. If we send them an email asking
what's up, and they don't reply, that's a really bad sign. So far
that is a 100% accurate predictor of death.","Whereas if a startup regularly does new deals and releases and either sends us mail or shows up at YC events, they're probably going to live. I realize this will sound naive, but maybe the linkage works in both directions. Maybe if you can arrange that we keep hearing from you, you won't die. That may not be so naive as it sounds. You've probably noticed that having dinners every Tuesday with us and the other founders causes you to get more done than you would otherwise, because every dinner is a mini Demo Day. Every dinner is a kind of a deadline. So the mere constraint of staying in regular contact with us will push you to make things happen, because otherwise you'll be embarrassed to tell us that you haven't done anything new since the last time we talked. If this works, it would be an amazing hack. It would be pretty cool if merely by staying in regular contact with us you could get rich. It sounds crazy, but there's a good chance that would work. A variant is to stay in touch with other YC-funded startups. There is now a whole neighborhood of them in San Francisco. If you move there, the peer pressure that made you work harder all summer will continue to operate. When startups die, the official cause of death is always either running out of money or a critical founder bailing. Often the two occur simultaneously. But I think the underlying cause is usually that they've become demoralized. You rarely hear of a startup that's working around the clock doing deals and pumping out new features, and dies because they can't pay their bills and their ISP unplugs their server. Startups rarely die in mid keystroke. So keep typing! If so many startups get demoralized and fail when merely by hanging on they could get rich, you have to assume that running a startup can be demoralizing. That is certainly true. I've been there, and that's why I've never done another startup. The low points in a startup are just unbelievably low. I bet even Google had moments where things seemed hopeless. Knowing that should help. If you know it's going to feel terrible sometimes, then when it feels terrible you won't think ""ouch, this feels terrible, I give up."" It feels that way for everyone. And if you just hang on, things will probably get better. The metaphor people use to describe the way a startup feels is at least a roller coaster and not drowning. You don't just sink and sink; there are ups after the downs. Another feeling that seems alarming but is in fact normal in a startup is the feeling that what you're doing isn't working. The reason you can expect to feel this is that what you do probably won't work. Startups almost never get it right the first time. Much more commonly you launch something, and no one cares. Don't assume when this happens that","So, if you want to avoid dying, don't ignore our emails. And if you
don't want to die, don't ignore our emails. Also, if you want to avoid dying, don't let your company die. So what's the best way to avoid having your company die? We've seen a lot of startups die because they didn't know what
their customers wanted. So the first step is to get to know your customers. If you're not sure what your customers want, you're not going to
know what to build. So we think that the first thing you should do is to get
feedback from your customers. The second thing is to find a way to make your product
relevant to the customer. And the third is to find a way to make your product
unreplaceable. So, if you're not sure what your customers want, you're not going to

Paul Graham,Organic Startup Ideas.txt,"Want to start a startup? Get funded by
Y Combinator. April 2010
The best way to come up with startup ideas is to ask yourself the
question: what do you wish someone would make for you? There are two types of startup ideas: those that grow organically
out of your own life, and those that you decide, from afar, are
going to be necessary to some class of users other than you. Apple
was the first type. Apple happened because Steve Wozniak wanted a
computer. Unlike most people who wanted computers, he could design
one, so he did. And since lots of other people wanted the same
thing, Apple was able to sell enough of them to get the company
rolling. They still rely on this principle today, incidentally. The iPhone is the phone Steve Jobs wants. [1]
Our own startup, Viaweb, was of the second type. We made software
for building online stores. We didn't need this software ourselves. We weren't direct marketers. We didn't even know when we started
that our users were called ""direct marketers."" But we were
comparatively old when we started the company (I was 30 and Robert
Morris was 29), so we'd seen enough to know users would need this
type of software. [2]
There is no sharp line between the two types of ideas, but
the most successful startups seem to be closer to the Apple type
than the Viaweb type. When he was writing that first Basic interpreter
for the Altair, Bill Gates was writing something he would use, as
were Larry and Sergey when they wrote the first versions of Google. Organic ideas are generally preferable to the made up kind, but
particularly so when the founders are young. It takes experience
to predict what other people will want. The worst ideas we see at
Y Combinator are from young founders making things they think other
people will want. So if you want to start a startup and don't know yet what you're
going to do, I'd encourage you to focus initially on organic ideas. What's missing or broken in your daily life? Sometimes if you just
ask that question you'll get immediate answers. It must have seemed
obviously broken to Bill Gates that you could only program the
Altair in machine language. You may need to stand outside yourself a bit to see brokenness,
because you tend to get used to it and take it for granted. You
can be sure it's there, though. There are always great ideas sitting
right under our noses. In 2004 it was ridiculous that Harvard
undergrads were still using a Facebook printed on paper. Surely
that sort of thing should have been online. There are ideas that obvious lying around now. The reason you're
overlooking them is the same reason you'd have overlooked the idea
of building Facebook in 2004: organic startup ideas usually don't
seem like startup ideas at first.","We know now that Facebook was very successful, but put yourself back in 2004. Putting undergraduates' profiles online wouldn't have seemed like much of a startup idea. And in fact, it wasn't initially a startup idea. When Mark spoke at a YC dinner this winter he said he wasn't trying to start a company when he wrote the first version of Facebook. It was just a project. So was the Apple I when Woz first started working on it. He didn't think he was starting a company. If these guys had thought they were starting companies, they might have been tempted to do something more ""serious,"" and that would have been a mistake. So if you want to come up with organic startup ideas, I'd encourage you to focus more on the idea part and less on the startup part. Just fix things that seem broken, regardless of whether it seems like the problem is important enough to build a company on. If you keep pursuing such threads it would be hard not to end up making something of value to a lot of people, and when you do, surprise, you've got a company. [3] Don't be discouraged if what you produce initially is something other people dismiss as a toy. In fact, that's a good sign. That's probably why everyone else has been overlooking the idea. The first microcomputers were dismissed as toys. And the first planes, and the first cars. At this point, when someone comes to us with something that users like but that we could envision forum trolls dismissing as a toy, it makes us especially likely to invest. While young founders are at a disadvantage when coming up with made-up ideas, they're the best source of organic ones, because they're at the forefront of technology. They use the latest stuff. They only just decided what to use, so why wouldn't they? And because they use the latest stuff, they're in a position to discover valuable types of fixable brokenness first. There's nothing more valuable than an unmet need that is just becoming fixable. If you find something broken that you can fix for a lot of people, you've found a gold mine. As with an actual gold mine, you still have to work hard to get the gold out of it. But at least you know where the seam is, and that's the hard part. Notes [1] This suggests a way to predict areas where Apple will be weak: things Steve Jobs doesn't use. E.g. I doubt he is much into gaming. [2] In retrospect, we should have become direct marketers. If I were doing Viaweb again, I'd open our own online store. If we had, we'd have understood users a lot better. I'd encourage anyone starting a startup to become one of its users, however unnatural it seems. [3] Possible exception: It's hard to compete directly with open source software. You can build things for programmers, but there has to be some part you","They seem like ""normal"" things that should be done. The idea of an online store is normal. The idea of an online store that you can build in a few minutes
with a few lines of code is not. The key is to identify what is normal and what is not. If you can't do that, you're probably not going to be able to find the
right idea. So the first step in finding a startup idea is to ask: what is
normal, what is not? What is the normal way people do things? What is the normal way people do things, in your life, in your
work, in the world? What is broken? Once you've identified that, the next step is to ask: how can I make
this better? The answer to that question is the startup idea. The idea is the thing that is broken, the thing that is not normal.
The idea is the thing that is not doing what it should be doing. So the question is: what is not normal? Once you have that, you can start thinking about the
business model. The question is: how do I make money off of this? The most important thing about the business model is that it
must be able to scale. The business model must be able to grow. That's why Y Combinator is so interested in the business model
when we look at startups. We don't just want to see a great idea. We want to see a great idea that can be scaled. So if you're trying to find a startup idea, the first step is to look
at what is normal and what is not. The second step is to look at what is broken and not broken. The third step is to look at how to make it better. The fourth step is to think about how to make money from it. So, the process is: find the broken thing, then figure out how to make it better, then figure out how",487,500,339,0.3225,0.154,0.9853,0.8923,0.9563,0.8492,-0.6821,-2.3558,0.4753,0.3482,0.0672,0.0601,0.0107,0.0064,0.5812,0.5141,0.9773,0.9481,0.425,0.43824027072758037,0.5398457583547558,7,4,0.9824,0.9624,0.14989733059548255,0.188,0.14749262536873156,0.9926,0.5473,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,How to Fund a Startup.txt,"Want to start a startup? Get funded by
Y Combinator. November 2005
Venture funding works like gears. A typical startup goes through
several rounds of funding, and at each round you want to take just
enough money to reach the speed where you can shift into the next
gear. Few startups get it quite right. Many are underfunded. A few are
overfunded, which is like trying to start driving in third gear. I think it would help founders to understand funding better—not
just the mechanics of it, but what investors are thinking. I was
surprised recently when I realized that all the worst problems we
faced in our startup were due not to competitors, but investors. Dealing with competitors was easy by comparison. I don't mean to suggest that our investors were nothing but a drag
on us. They were helpful in negotiating deals, for example. I
mean more that conflicts with investors are particularly nasty. Competitors punch you in the jaw, but investors have you by the
balls. Apparently our situation was not unusual. And if trouble with
investors is one of the biggest threats to a startup, managing them
is one of the most important skills founders need to learn. Let's start by talking about the five sources of startup funding. Then we'll trace the life of a hypothetical (very fortunate) startup
as it shifts gears through successive rounds. Friends and Family
A lot of startups get their first funding from friends and family. Excite did, for example: after the founders graduated from college,
they borrowed $15,000 from their parents to start a company. With
the help of some part-time jobs they made it last 18 months. If your friends or family happen to be rich, the line blurs between
them and angel investors. At Viaweb we got our first $10,000 of
seed money from our friend Julian, but he was sufficiently rich
that it's hard to say whether he should be classified as a friend
or angel. He was also a lawyer, which was great, because it meant
we didn't have to pay legal bills out of that initial small sum. The advantage of raising money from friends and family is that
they're easy to find. You already know them. There are three main
disadvantages: you mix together your business and personal life;
they will probably not be as well connected as angels or venture
firms; and they may not be accredited investors, which could
complicate your life later. The SEC defines an ""accredited investor"" as someone with over a
million dollars in liquid assets or an income of over $200,000 a
year. The regulatory burden is much lower if a company's shareholders
are all accredited investors. Once you take money from the general
public you're more restricted in what you can do. [1]
A startup's life will be more complicated, legally, if any of the
investors aren't accredited. In an IPO, it might not merely add
expense, but change the outcome.","A lawyer I asked about it said: When the company goes public, the SEC will carefully study all prior issuances of stock by the company and demand that it take immediate action to cure any past violations of securities laws. Those remedial actions can delay, stall or even kill the IPO. Of course the odds of any given startup doing an IPO are small. But not as small as they might seem. A lot of startups that end up going public didn't seem likely to at first. (Who could have guessed that the company Wozniak and Jobs started in their spare time selling plans for microcomputers would yield one of the biggest IPOs of the decade?) Much of the value of a startup consists of that tiny probability multiplied by the huge outcome. It wasn't because they weren't accredited investors that I didn't ask my parents for seed money, though. When we were starting Viaweb, I didn't know about the concept of an accredited investor, and didn't stop to think about the value of investors' connections. The reason I didn't take money from my parents was that I didn't want them to lose it. Consulting Another way to fund a startup is to get a job. The best sort of job is a consulting project in which you can build whatever software you wanted to sell as a startup. Then you can gradually transform yourself from a consulting company into a product company, and have your clients pay your development expenses. This is a good plan for someone with kids, because it takes most of the risk out of starting a startup. There never has to be a time when you have no revenues. Risk and reward are usually proportionate, however: you should expect a plan that cuts the risk of starting a startup also to cut the average return. In this case, you trade decreased financial risk for increased risk that your company won't succeed as a startup. But isn't the consulting company itself a startup? No, not generally. A company has to be more than small and newly founded to be a startup. There are millions of small businesses in America, but only a few thousand are startups. To be a startup, a company has to be a product business, not a service business. By which I mean not that it has to make something physical, but that it has to have one thing it sells to many people, rather than doing custom work for individual clients. Custom work doesn't scale. To be a startup you need to be the band that sells a million copies of a song, not the band that makes money by playing at individual weddings and bar mitzvahs. The trouble with consulting is that clients have an awkward habit of calling you on the phone. Most startups operate close to the margin of failure, and the distraction of having to deal with clients could be enough to put you over the edge. Especially","The problem is not that you
can't get funding from non-accredited investors, but that the
regulatory burden is high. If you are not accredited, you have to
answer more questions about the company. If you are not
accredited, you have't been vetted by the SEC, and the company
hasn't been vetted by any of the independent third-party
reviewers. The first two rounds of funding for most startups are
seed and series A. Seed is the first round, which is
usually the most difficult. Series A is the next round, which is more
structured and has more money. In the first round, you have to
convince investors that your business has a chance of being
successful. The second round is more about scaling up. If the first round is
successful, the company is more likely to be able to scale up.
So, the seed round is a bet on the business model, while the
series A round is a bet on the scalability of the business. In the seed round, the company is in the very early stage, with
no revenue, and with only a few customers. In the series A round, the company has some revenue and
a few customers, and is ready to scale. If the company is not ready to scale, it might not be able to get
through the series A round. The seed round is often funded by angel investors and friends and
family. The series A round is usually funded by venture capital firms.
So, the seed round is about proving the business model, while
the series A round is about scaling. Let's now take a look at the series B round. Series B is the third round, and is the most common round
for startups that are going to go public. The series B round is typically funded by venture capital
firms. The company is now in the growth phase, with a more
established business model.

Paul Graham,What I Did this Summer.txt,"October 2005
The first Summer Founders Program has just finished. We were
surprised how well it went. Overall only about 10% of startups
succeed, but if I had to guess now, I'd predict three or four of
the eight startups we funded will make it. Of the startups that needed further funding, I believe all have
either closed a round or are likely to soon. Two have already
turned down (lowball) acquisition offers. We would have been happy if just one of the eight seemed promising
by the end of the summer. What's going on? Did some kind of anomaly
make this summer's applicants especially good? We worry about that,
but we can't think of one. We'll find out this winter. The whole summer was full of surprises. The best was that the hypothesis we were testing seems to be
correct. Young hackers can start viable companies. This is good
news for two reasons: (a) it's an encouraging thought, and (b) it
means that Y Combinator, which is predicated on the idea, is not
hosed. Age
More precisely, the hypothesis was that success in a startup depends
mainly on how smart and energetic you are, and much less on how old
you are or how much business experience you have. The results so
far bear this out. The 2005 summer founders ranged in age from 18
to 28 (average 23), and there is no correlation between their ages
and how well they're doing. This should not really be surprising. Bill Gates and Michael Dell
were both 19 when they started the companies that made them famous. Young founders are not a new phenomenon: the trend began as soon
as computers got cheap enough for college kids to afford them. Another of our hypotheses was that you can start a startup on less
money than most people think. Other investors were surprised to
hear the most we gave any group was $20,000. But we knew it was
possible to start on that little because we started Viaweb on
$10,000. And so it proved this summer. Three months' funding is enough to
get into second gear. We had a demo day for potential investors
ten weeks in, and seven of the eight groups had a prototype ready
by that time. One, Reddit, had
already launched, and were able to give a demo of their live site. A researcher who studied the SFP startups said the one thing they
had in common was that they all worked ridiculously hard. People
this age are commonly seen as lazy. I think in some cases it's not
so much that they lack the appetite for work, but that the work
they're offered is unappetizing. The experience of the SFP suggests that if you let motivated people
do real work, they work hard, whatever their age.","As one of the founders said ""I'd read that starting a startup consumed your life, but I had no idea what that meant until I did it."" I'd feel guilty if I were a boss making people work this hard. But we're not these people's bosses. They're working on their own projects. And what makes them work is not us but their competitors. Like good athletes, they don't work hard because the coach yells at them, but because they want to win. We have less power than bosses, and yet the founders work harder than employees. It seems like a win for everyone. The only catch is that we get on average only about 5-7% of the upside, while an employer gets nearly all of it. (We're counting on it being 5-7% of a much larger number.) As well as working hard, the groups all turned out to be extraordinarily responsible. I can't think of a time when one failed to do something they'd promised to, even by being late for an appointment. This is another lesson the world has yet to learn. One of the founders discovered that the hardest part of arranging a meeting with executives at a big cell phone carrier was getting a rental company to rent him a car, because he was too young. I think the problem here is much the same as with the apparent laziness of people this age. They seem lazy because the work they're given is pointless, and they act irresponsible because they're not given any power. Some of them, anyway. We only have a sample size of about twenty, but it seems so far that if you let people in their early twenties be their own bosses, they rise to the occasion. Morale The summer founders were as a rule very idealistic. They also wanted very much to get rich. These qualities might seem incompatible, but they're not. These guys want to get rich, but they want to do it by changing the world. They wouldn't (well, seven of the eight groups wouldn't) be interested in making money by speculating in stocks. They want to make something people use. I think this makes them more effective as founders. As hard as people will work for money, they'll work harder for a cause. And since success in a startup depends so much on motivation, the paradoxical result is that the people likely to make the most money are those who aren't in it just for the money. The founders of Kiko, for example, are working on an Ajax calendar. They want to get rich, but they pay more attention to design than they would if that were their only motivation. You can tell just by looking at it. I never considered it till this summer, but this might be another reason startups run by hackers tend to do better than those run by MBAs. Perhaps it's not just that hackers understand technology better, but that they're driven by more powerful","In the past, we've thought that young people were not good at
managing their time, but this summer, we saw that they could
manage their time very well. We were also surprised by the number of startups that
needed additional funding. We had anticipated that some would, but we had not
anticipated that so many would. It's a sign that the market is getting more competitive. We have
seen that in the past, but not as much. We had a few startups that were
very good, but not good enough. The fact that they needed more money was a sign that they could
have been better, but we had to wait until next summer to see.
We had a few startups that were very bad. We had a few that were just okay. But overall, the
results are positive. The SFP is an experiment in how to get young people to start
companies. The results so far are positive. But we're not sure that it's the right way. We are still
experimenting. We'll find out in the next few months. We're not
trying to claim that the Sabin method is the best, but rather that it's
a way to test it. The Sabin method is not the only way to start a business, but it's a
good way. The key is that the startups are not a
random sample of young people. They are a sample of young people who have been
selected for their
intelligence and energy. So the results may not be generalizable. We're trying to find out what is special about them, and how to
make it more generalizable. So the SFP is a kind of lab, or test
bed, for finding out how to make the process of starting a company
more accessible to more people. The SFP is also a kind of lab for figuring out what makes a
successful startup. We're trying to find out the factors that make",469,500,325,0.288,0.2364,0.9547,0.9667,0.9529,0.9015,0.7661,-1.5255,0.4458,0.4387,0.059,0.0622,0.0149,0.0065,0.4878,0.6919,0.9811,0.9802,0.4462962962962963,0.47322970639032813,0.5283018867924528,6,6,0.9793,0.9798,0.14925373134328357,0.158,0.14153846153846153,0.8744,0.6384,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,What Happened to Yahoo .txt,"Want to start a startup? Get funded by
Y Combinator. August 2010
When I went to work for Yahoo after they bought our startup in 1998,
it felt like the center of the world. It was supposed to be the
next big thing. It was supposed to be what Google turned out to
be. What went wrong? The problems that hosed Yahoo go back a long time,
practically to the beginning of the company. They were already
very visible when I got there in 1998. Yahoo had two problems
Google didn't: easy money, and ambivalence about being a technology
company. Money
The first time I met Jerry Yang, we thought we were meeting for
different reasons. He thought we were meeting so he could check
us out in person before buying us. I thought we were meeting so we
could show him our new technology, Revenue Loop. It was a way of
sorting shopping search results. Merchants bid a percentage of
sales for traffic, but the results were sorted not by the bid but
by the bid times the average amount a user would buy. It was
like the algorithm Google uses now to sort ads, but this was in the
spring of 1998, before Google was founded. Revenue Loop was the optimal sort for shopping search, in the sense
that it sorted in order of how much money Yahoo would make from
each link. But it wasn't just optimal in that sense. Ranking
search results by user behavior also makes search better. Users
train the search: you can start out finding matches based on mere
textual similarity, and as users buy more stuff the search results
get better and better. Jerry didn't seem to care. I was confused. I was showing him
technology that extracted the maximum value from search traffic,
and he didn't care? I couldn't tell whether I was explaining it
badly, or he was just very poker faced. I didn't realize the answer till later, after I went to work at
Yahoo. It was neither of my guesses. The reason Yahoo didn't care
about a technique that extracted the full value of traffic was that
advertisers were already overpaying for it. If Yahoo merely extracted
the actual value, they'd have made less. Hard as it is to believe now, the big money then was in banner ads. Advertisers were willing to pay ridiculous amounts for banner ads. So Yahoo's sales force had evolved to exploit this source of revenue. Led by a large and terrifyingly formidable man called Anil Singh,
Yahoo's sales guys would fly out to Procter & Gamble and come back
with million dollar orders for banner ad impressions. The prices seemed cheap compared to print, which was what advertisers,
for lack of any other reference, compared them to. But they were
expensive compared to what they were worth. So these big, dumb
companies were a dangerous source of revenue to depend on. But
there was another source even more dangerous: other Internet startups.","By 1998, Yahoo was the beneficiary of a de facto Ponzi scheme. Investors were excited about the Internet. One reason they were excited was Yahoo's revenue growth. So they invested in new Internet startups. The startups then used the money to buy ads on Yahoo to get traffic. Which caused yet more revenue growth for Yahoo, and further convinced investors the Internet was worth investing in. When I realized this one day, sitting in my cubicle, I jumped up like Archimedes in his bathtub, except instead of ""Eureka!"" I was shouting ""Sell!"" Both the Internet startups and the Procter & Gambles were doing brand advertising. They didn't care about targeting. They just wanted lots of people to see their ads. So traffic became the thing to get at Yahoo. It didn't matter what type. [1] It wasn't just Yahoo. All the search engines were doing it. This was why they were trying to get people to start calling them ""portals"" instead of ""search engines."" Despite the actual meaning of the word portal, what they meant by it was a site where users would find what they wanted on the site itself, instead of just passing through on their way to other destinations, as they did at a search engine. I remember telling David Filo in late 1998 or early 1999 that Yahoo should buy Google, because I and most of the other programmers in the company were using it instead of Yahoo for search. He told me that it wasn't worth worrying about. Search was only 6% of our traffic, and we were growing at 10% a month. It wasn't worth doing better. I didn't say ""But search traffic is worth more than other traffic!"" I said ""Oh, ok."" Because I didn't realize either how much search traffic was worth. I'm not sure even Larry and Sergey did then. If they had, Google presumably wouldn't have expended any effort on enterprise search. If circumstances had been different, the people running Yahoo might have realized sooner how important search was. But they had the most opaque obstacle in the world between them and the truth: money. As long as customers were writing big checks for banner ads, it was hard to take search seriously. Google didn't have that to distract them. Hackers But Yahoo also had another problem that made it hard to change directions. They'd been thrown off balance from the start by their ambivalence about being a technology company. One of the weirdest things about Yahoo when I went to work there was the way they insisted on calling themselves a ""media company."" If you walked around their offices, it seemed like a software company. The cubicles were full of programmers writing code, product managers thinking about feature lists and ship dates, support people (yes, there were actually support people) telling users to restart their browsers, and so on, just like a software company. So why did they call themselves a media company? One reason was the way they","So when I joined Yahoo in 1998, they were already in the
process of becoming a media company. Their core business was
ads, and they had a huge amount of traffic. The problem was that
they were not a technology company. They had a lot of
technology, but they didn't use it. They didn't understand it. They didn't care about it. That was the
first problem. The second was that they had a lot of money. They had a lot of
money from the investors who had already given them a lot of
money. So they didn't need to be as aggressive as they were. They didn't need to be as innovative. They didn't need to be as hardworking as they were. The money was there, so they didn't have to be. The problem with that was that if you don't push hard, you get
left behind. That was what happened to Yahoo. They were not as
aggressive as Google, and they didn't have the same
relentless focus. So in the end, it was two problems that hosed Yahoo: they were not
a technology company, and they had too much money. So if you're a startup, you have to be a technology company, and
you have to be very aggressive, and you have to be very
innovative. But if you're a big company, you have to be a technology
company, and you have to be very aggressive, and you have to be
very innovative. But you don't have too much money. So the question is, how do you avoid the problem that hosed Yahoo? How do you avoid being too comfortable, too complacent, too
relaxing, too laid back, too easy, too easy to do the same
things over and over again, and not to change? The problem with Yahoo is that they had too much money, and they
didn't",500,500,309,0.3762,0.2323,0.9865,0.9179,0.9497,0.9627,-0.732,-0.5429,0.4204,0.3723,0.0645,0.0557,0.0102,0.0071,0.7137,0.6593,0.9843,0.9467,0.4144620811287478,0.4268707482993197,0.5858310626702997,8,3,0.9348,0.9537,0.136,0.174,0.18770226537216828,0.9833,0.5474,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,What the Bubble Got Right.txt,"September 2004
(This essay is derived from an invited talk at ICFP 2004.)
I had a front row seat for the Internet Bubble,
because I worked at Yahoo during 1998 and 1999. One day,
when the stock was trading around $200, I sat down and calculated
what I thought the price should be. The
answer I got was $12. I went to
the next cubicle and told my friend Trevor. ""Twelve!"" he said. He tried to sound indignant, but he didn't quite manage it. He
knew as well as I did that our valuation was crazy. Yahoo was a special case. It was not just our price to earnings
ratio that was bogus. Half our earnings were too. Not in
the Enron way, of course. The finance guys seemed
scrupulous about reporting earnings. What made our
earnings bogus was that Yahoo was, in effect, the center of
a Ponzi scheme. Investors looked at Yahoo's earnings
and said to themselves, here is proof that Internet companies can make
money. So they invested in new
startups that promised to be the next Yahoo. And as soon as these startups
got the money, what did they do with it? Buy millions of dollars worth of advertising on Yahoo to promote
their brand. Result: a capital investment in a startup this
quarter shows up as Yahoo earnings next quarter—stimulating
another round of investments in startups. As in a Ponzi scheme, what seemed to be the returns of this system
were simply the latest round of investments in it. What made it not a Ponzi scheme was that it was unintentional. At least, I think it was. The venture capital business is pretty incestuous,
and there were presumably people in a position, if not to create
this situation, to realize what was happening and to milk it. A year later the game was up. Starting in January 2000, Yahoo's
stock price began to crash, ultimately losing 95% of its
value. Notice, though, that even with all the fat trimmed off its market
cap, Yahoo was still worth a lot. Even at the morning-after
valuations of March and April 2001, the people at Yahoo had managed
to create a company worth about $8 billion in just six years. The fact is, despite all the nonsense we heard
during the Bubble about the ""new economy,"" there was a
core of truth. You need
that to get a really big bubble: you need to have something
solid at the center, so that even smart people are sucked in. (Isaac Newton and Jonathan Swift both lost money
in the South Sea Bubble of 1720.)
Now the pendulum has swung the other way. Now anything that
became fashionable during the Bubble is ipso facto unfashionable. But that's a mistake—an even bigger mistake than believing
what everyone was saying in 1999. Over the long term,
what the Bubble got right will be more important than what
it got wrong. 1.","Retail VC After the excesses of the Bubble, it's now considered dubious to take companies public before they have earnings. But there is nothing intrinsically wrong with that idea. Taking a company public at an early stage is simply retail VC: instead of going to venture capital firms for the last round of funding, you go to the public markets. By the end of the Bubble, companies going public with no earnings were being derided as ""concept stocks,"" as if it were inherently stupid to invest in them. But investing in concepts isn't stupid; it's what VCs do, and the best of them are far from stupid. The stock of a company that doesn't yet have earnings is worth something. It may take a while for the market to learn how to value such companies, just as it had to learn to value common stocks in the early 20th century. But markets are good at solving that kind of problem. I wouldn't be surprised if the market ultimately did a better job than VCs do now. Going public early will not be the right plan for every company. And it can of course be disruptive—by distracting the management, or by making the early employees suddenly rich. But just as the market will learn how to value startups, startups will learn how to minimize the damage of going public. 2. The Internet The Internet genuinely is a big deal. That was one reason even smart people were fooled by the Bubble. Obviously it was going to have a huge effect. Enough of an effect to triple the value of Nasdaq companies in two years? No, as it turned out. But it was hard to say for certain at the time. [1] The same thing happened during the Mississippi and South Sea Bubbles. What drove them was the invention of organized public finance (the South Sea Company, despite its name, was really a competitor of the Bank of England). And that did turn out to be a big deal, in the long run. Recognizing an important trend turns out to be easier than figuring out how to profit from it. The mistake investors always seem to make is to take the trend too literally. Since the Internet was the big new thing, investors supposed that the more Internettish the company, the better. Hence such parodies as Pets.Com. In fact most of the money to be made from big trends is made indirectly. It was not the railroads themselves that made the most money during the railroad boom, but the companies on either side, like Carnegie's steelworks, which made the rails, and Standard Oil, which used railroads to get oil to the East Coast, where it could be shipped to Europe. I think the Internet will have great effects, and that what we've seen so far is nothing compared to what's coming. But most of the winners will only indirectly be Internet companies; for every Google there will be ten JetBlues. 3. Choices","The first lesson is that you need to have something real to
build on. The Internet is not a silver bullet, not a magic
bullet, not a new economy. The Internet is just a tool. 2. The second lesson is that you need to have the right people
in the right places. 3. The third lesson is that you need to have a plan. It's not enough to have a good idea. You need to have a plan to implement it. The plan needs to be based on some sort of model. 4. The fourth lesson is that you need to have a system. The system is the
structure of the business. 5. The fifth lesson is that you need to have a process. The process is the
way the business is run. 6. The sixth lesson is that you need to have a
culture. The culture is the
way the business is lived.
The key to the Bubble was that the entire system was
in a state of perpetual optimism, and that the system was
designed to feed the optimism. The key to the crash was that the system was in a state of
perpetual pessimism, and that the system was designed to feed the
pessimism.
The only way to build a business that can survive the
crash is to have a real product that people want, not just
a product that is interesting to the people in the
system. The only way to survive the crash is to be
independent of the system. You can't be independent of the system
unless you have a real product that people want.
But the problem with the system is that it's not a
system at all. It's a process. It's a process that's been driven by the same
people who are in the system. So the only way to be independent of the system
is to be a real product that people want.

Paul Graham,How to Write Usefully.txt,"February 2020
What should an essay be? Many people would say persuasive. That's
what a lot of us were taught essays should be. But I think we can
aim for something more ambitious: that an essay should be useful. To start with, that means it should be correct. But it's not enough
merely to be correct. It's easy to make a statement correct by
making it vague. That's a common flaw in academic writing, for
example. If you know nothing at all about an issue, you can't go
wrong by saying that the issue is a complex one, that there are
many factors to be considered, that it's a mistake to take too
simplistic a view of it, and so on. Though no doubt correct, such statements tell the reader nothing. Useful writing makes claims that are as strong as they can be made
without becoming false. For example, it's more useful to say that Pike's Peak is near the
middle of Colorado than merely somewhere in Colorado. But if I say
it's in the exact middle of Colorado, I've now gone too far, because
it's a bit east of the middle. Precision and correctness are like opposing forces. It's easy to
satisfy one if you ignore the other. The converse of vaporous
academic writing is the bold, but false, rhetoric of demagogues. Useful writing is bold, but true. It's also two other things: it tells people something important,
and that at least some of them didn't already know. Telling people something they didn't know doesn't always mean
surprising them. Sometimes it means telling them something they
knew unconsciously but had never put into words. In fact those may
be the more valuable insights, because they tend to be more
fundamental. Let's put them all together. Useful writing tells people something
true and important that they didn't already know, and tells them
as unequivocally as possible. Notice these are all a matter of degree. For example, you can't
expect an idea to be novel to everyone. Any insight that you have
will probably have already been had by at least one of the world's
7 billion people. But it's sufficient if an idea is novel to a lot
of readers. Ditto for correctness, importance, and strength. In effect the four
components are like numbers you can multiply together to get a score
for usefulness. Which I realize is almost awkwardly reductive, but
nonetheless true. _____
How can you ensure that the things you say are true and novel and
important? Believe it or not, there is a trick for doing this. I
learned it from my friend Robert Morris, who has a horror of saying
anything dumb. His trick is not to say anything unless he's sure
it's worth hearing. This makes it hard to get opinions out of him,
but when you do, they're usually right. Translated into essay writing, what this means is that if you write
a bad sentence, you don't publish it.","You delete it and try again. Often you abandon whole branches of four or five paragraphs. Sometimes a whole essay. You can't ensure that every idea you have is good, but you can ensure that every one you publish is, by simply not publishing the ones that aren't. In the sciences, this is called publication bias, and is considered bad. When some hypothesis you're exploring gets inconclusive results, you're supposed to tell people about that too. But with essay writing, publication bias is the way to go. My strategy is loose, then tight. I write the first draft of an essay fast, trying out all kinds of ideas. Then I spend days rewriting it very carefully. I've never tried to count how many times I proofread essays, but I'm sure there are sentences I've read 100 times before publishing them. When I proofread an essay, there are usually passages that stick out in an annoying way, sometimes because they're clumsily written, and sometimes because I'm not sure they're true. The annoyance starts out unconscious, but after the tenth reading or so I'm saying ""Ugh, that part"" each time I hit it. They become like briars that catch your sleeve as you walk past. Usually I won't publish an essay till they're all gone — till I can read through the whole thing without the feeling of anything catching. I'll sometimes let through a sentence that seems clumsy, if I can't think of a way to rephrase it, but I will never knowingly let through one that doesn't seem correct. You never have to. If a sentence doesn't seem right, all you have to do is ask why it doesn't, and you've usually got the replacement right there in your head. This is where essayists have an advantage over journalists. You don't have a deadline. You can work for as long on an essay as you need to get it right. You don't have to publish the essay at all, if you can't get it right. Mistakes seem to lose courage in the face of an enemy with unlimited resources. Or that's what it feels like. What's really going on is that you have different expectations for yourself. You're like a parent saying to a child ""we can sit here all night till you eat your vegetables."" Except you're the child too. I'm not saying no mistake gets through. For example, I added condition (c) in ""A Way to Detect Bias"" after readers pointed out that I'd omitted it. But in practice you can catch nearly all of them. There's a trick for getting importance too. It's like the trick I suggest to young founders for getting startup ideas: to make something you yourself want. You can use yourself as a proxy for the reader. The reader is not completely unlike you, so if you write about topics that seem important to you, they'll probably seem important to a significant number of readers as well. Importance has two factors. It's the","If you write a bad paragraph, you don't publish it. If you write a bad essay, you don't publish it. If you write something that is not worth hearing, you don't
publish it. The result is that you get only the best of your ideas. In fact, the more you write, the more you get the feeling that
your ideas are getting better. This is the most important thing about writing. It's not that you get better at writing, but that you get better
at thinking. The more you write, the more you think. The more you think, the more you write. It's a virtuous cycle. You start with a few ideas, and as you write, you get more
ideas. And as you get more ideas, you write more. You don't have to be a genius to do this. You just have to be willing to write. It's a bit like learning to ride a bicycle. You have to get out there and try, and you have to fall
a few times. And then you get the hang of it. But the point is that you get better at it. So, in short, the trick is to be very selective about what you write.

Paul Graham,Having Kids.txt,"December 2019
Before I had kids, I was afraid of having kids. Up to that point I
felt about kids the way the young Augustine felt about living
virtuously. I'd have been sad to think I'd never have children. But did I want them now? No. If I had kids, I'd become a parent, and parents, as I'd known since
I was a kid, were uncool. They were dull and responsible and had
no fun. And while it's not surprising that kids would believe that,
to be honest I hadn't seen much as an adult to change my mind. Whenever I'd noticed parents with kids, the kids seemed to be
terrors, and the parents pathetic harried creatures, even when they
prevailed. When people had babies, I congratulated them enthusiastically,
because that seemed to be what one did. But I didn't feel it at
all. ""Better you than me,"" I was thinking. Now when people have babies I congratulate them enthusiastically and
I mean it. Especially the first one. I feel like they just got the best gift in the world. What changed, of course, is that I had kids. Something I dreaded
turned out to be wonderful. Partly, and I won't deny it, this is because of serious chemical
changes that happened almost instantly when our first child was
born. It was like someone flipped a switch. I suddenly felt
protective not just toward our child, but toward all children. As I was
driving my wife and new son home from the hospital, I approached a
crosswalk full of pedestrians, and I found myself thinking ""I have
to be really careful of all these people. Every one of them is
someone's child!""
So to some extent you can't trust me when I say having kids is
great. To some extent I'm like a religious cultist telling you
that you'll be happy if you join the cult too — but only because
joining the cult will alter your mind in a way that will make you
happy to be a cult member. But not entirely. There were some things
about having kids that I clearly got wrong before I had them. For example, there was a huge amount of selection bias in my
observations of parents and children. Some parents may have noticed
that I wrote ""Whenever I'd noticed parents with kids."" Of course
the times I noticed kids were when things were going wrong. I only
noticed them when they made noise. And where was I when I noticed
them? Ordinarily I never went to places with kids, so the only
times I encountered them were in shared bottlenecks like airplanes. Which is not exactly a representative sample. Flying with a toddler
is something very few parents enjoy. What I didn't notice, because they tend to be much quieter, were
all the great moments parents had with kids.","People don't talk about these much — the magic is hard to put into words, and all other parents know about them anyway — but one of the great things about having kids is that there are so many times when you feel there is nowhere else you'd rather be, and nothing else you'd rather be doing. You don't have to be doing anything special. You could just be going somewhere together, or putting them to bed, or pushing them on the swings at the park. But you wouldn't trade these moments for anything. One doesn't tend to associate kids with peace, but that's what you feel. You don't need to look any further than where you are right now. Before I had kids, I had moments of this kind of peace, but they were rarer. With kids it can happen several times a day. My other source of data about kids was my own childhood, and that was similarly misleading. I was pretty bad, and was always in trouble for something or other. So it seemed to me that parenthood was essentially law enforcement. I didn't realize there were good times too. I remember my mother telling me once when I was about 30 that she'd really enjoyed having me and my sister. My god, I thought, this woman is a saint. She not only endured all the pain we subjected her to, but actually enjoyed it? Now I realize she was simply telling the truth. She said that one reason she liked having us was that we'd been interesting to talk to. That took me by surprise when I had kids. You don't just love them. They become your friends too. They're really interesting. And while I admit small children are disastrously fond of repetition (anything worth doing once is worth doing fifty times) it's often genuinely fun to play with them. That surprised me too. Playing with a 2 year old was fun when I was 2 and definitely not fun when I was 6. Why would it become fun again later? But it does. There are of course times that are pure drudgery. Or worse still, terror. Having kids is one of those intense types of experience that are hard to imagine unless you've had them. But it is not, as I implicitly believed before having kids, simply your DNA heading for the lifeboats. Some of my worries about having kids were right, though. They definitely make you less productive. I know having kids makes some people get their act together, but if your act was already together, you're going to have less time to do it in. In particular, you're going to have to work to a schedule. Kids have schedules. I'm not sure if it's because that's how kids are, or because it's the only way to integrate their lives with adults', but once you have kids, you tend to have to work on their schedule. You will have chunks of time to work.","The things that make
being a parent so rewarding. The times when a child's smile makes you feel
like the whole world is happy. The times when a child's innocent
questions make you feel like you're in a world of wonder again. So I was wrong before I had kids. But I was also wrong after. I had the child, and I was
surprised by how much I was able to love him. I didn't know that I could love someone so much. I didn't know that I could be so completely absorbed in someone's
life. I didn't know that I could be so vulnerable. I didn't know that I could be so dependent on another person's
life. I didn't know that I could be so unselfish. I didn't know that I could be so patient. I didn't know that I could be so kind. I didn't know that I could be so brave. I didn't know that I could be so responsible. I didn't know that I could be so selfless. I didn't know that I could be so full of gratitude. I didn't know that I could be so full of love. I didn't know that I could be so completely in love. I didn't know that I could be so completely in love. And I didn't know that I could be so completely in love with my
child. And that's the thing. When I was a kid, I thought I knew a lot. I thought I was
experienced. I thought I had a good understanding of what it meant to be
a person. But I didn't. I didn't know that I could be so completely in love. I didn't know that I could be so completely in love. So I think that's the point of this story. I think that's what I'm trying to say. I think that's what I'm trying to say.

Paul Graham,The High-Res Society.txt,"December 2008
For nearly all of history the success of a society was proportionate
to its ability to assemble large and disciplined organizations. Those who bet on economies of scale generally won, which meant the
largest organizations were the most successful ones. Things have already changed so much that this is hard for us to
believe, but till just a few decades ago the largest organizations
tended to be the most progressive. An ambitious kid graduating
from college in 1960 wanted to work in the huge, gleaming offices
of Ford, or General Electric, or NASA. Small meant small-time. Small in 1960 didn't mean a cool little startup. It meant uncle
Sid's shoe store. When I grew up in the 1970s, the idea of the ""corporate ladder"" was
still very much alive. The standard plan was to try to get into a
good college, from which one would be drafted into some organization
and then rise to positions of gradually increasing responsibility. The more ambitious merely hoped to climb the same ladder faster. [1]
But in the late twentieth century something changed. It turned out
that economies of scale were not the only force at work. Particularly
in technology, the increase in speed one could get from smaller
groups started to trump the advantages of size. The future turned out to be different from the one we were expecting
in 1970. The domed cities and flying cars we expected have failed
to materialize. But fortunately so have the jumpsuits with badges
indicating our specialty and rank. Instead of being dominated by
a few, giant tree-structured organizations, it's now looking like
the economy of the future will be a fluid network of smaller,
independent units. It's not so much that large organizations stopped working. There's
no evidence that famously successful organizations like the Roman
army or the British East India Company were any less afflicted by
protocol and politics than organizations of the same size today. But they were competing against opponents who couldn't change the
rules on the fly by discovering new technology. Now it turns out
the rule ""large and disciplined organizations win"" needs to have a
qualification appended: ""at games that change slowly."" No one knew
till change reached a sufficient speed. Large organizations will start to do worse now, though,
because for the first time in history they're no longer getting the
best people. An ambitious kid graduating from college now doesn't
want to work for a big company. They want to work for the hot
startup that's rapidly growing into one. If they're really ambitious,
they want to start it. [2]
This doesn't mean big companies will disappear. To say that
startups will succeed implies that big companies will exist, because
startups that succeed either become big companies or are acquired
by them. [3]
But large organizations will probably never again
play the leading role they did up till the last quarter of the
twentieth century.","It's kind of surprising that a trend that lasted so long would ever run out. How often does it happen that a rule works for thousands of years, then switches polarity? The millennia-long run of bigger-is-better left us with a lot of traditions that are now obsolete, but extremely deeply rooted. Which means the ambitious can now do arbitrage on them. It will be very valuable to understand precisely which ideas to keep and which can now be discarded. The place to look is where the spread of smallness began: in the world of startups. There have always been occasional cases, particularly in the US, of ambitious people who grew the ladder under them instead of climbing it. But till recently this was an anomalous route that tended to be followed only by outsiders. It was no coincidence that the great industrialists of the nineteenth century had so little formal education. As huge as their companies eventually became, they were all essentially mechanics and shopkeepers at first. That was a social step no one with a college education would take if they could avoid it. Till the rise of technology startups, and in particular, Internet startups, it was very unusual for educated people to start their own businesses. The eight men who left Shockley Semiconductor to found Fairchild Semiconductor, the original Silicon Valley startup, weren't even trying to start a company at first. They were just looking for a company willing to hire them as a group. Then one of their parents introduced them to a small investment bank that offered to find funding for them to start their own, so they did. But starting a company was an alien idea to them; it was something they backed into. [4] Now I would guess that practically every Stanford or Berkeley undergrad who knows how to program has at least considered the idea of starting a startup. East Coast universities are not far behind, and British universities only a little behind them. This pattern suggests that attitudes at Stanford and Berkeley are not an anomaly, but a leading indicator. This is the way the world is going. Of course, Internet startups are still only a fraction of the world's economy. Could a trend based on them be that powerful? I think so. There's no reason to suppose there's any limit to the amount of work that could be done in this area. Like science, wealth seems to expand fractally. Steam power was a sliver of the British economy when Watt started working on it. But his work led to more work till that sliver had expanded into something bigger than the whole economy of which it had initially been a part. The same thing could happen with the Internet. If Internet startups offer the best opportunity for ambitious people, then a lot of ambitious people will start them, and this bit of the economy will balloon in the usual fractal way. Even if Internet-related applications only become a tenth of the","The biggest companies today are not the most
innovative. The biggest companies are the most bureaucratic. The
most innovative companies are small, and the most efficient ones
are small. The most efficient companies are small. [4]
The shift is not only in the direction of smaller organizations
but also in the way that they are organized. In the past, it was
about the number of people in the organization. Now it's about the
number of people who are involved in the decision-making. It's about
the speed at which decisions are made. It's about the number of
people who can be trusted to make decisions. The new economy is
not about the size of the organization but about the agility of
the organization. [5]
This is the first time in history that we've seen the
agility of organizations matter more than the size of the
organization. [6]
The question is: how do we get from the current situation to
the future one? What are the implications of this change? How
does it affect the way we live and work? [7]
The answer is to create an organization that is agile. The first step is
to move from a hierarchical structure to a more horizontal one.
In the past, hierarchy was the norm. Now, people want to be
involved in the decision-making. They want to know what is
happening, and to have a say in what is happening. [8]
In the past, people were not involved in the decision-making
process. The hierarchy was a way to control the flow of
information and to make sure that the right information got to the
right people. Now, the hierarchy is an obstacle to the flow of
information and to the sharing of information. [9]
The new organization must be one where the people are involved
in the decision-making process. [10]
The most important thing is that people have to trust each

(This essay is derived from a talk at the Berkeley CSUA.)
The three big powers on the Internet now are Yahoo, Google, and
Microsoft. Average age of their founders: 24. So it is pretty
well established now that grad students can start successful
companies. And if grad students can do it, why not undergrads? Like everything else in technology, the cost of starting a startup
has decreased dramatically. Now it's so low that it has disappeared
into the noise. The main cost of starting a Web-based
startup is food and rent. Which means it doesn't cost much more
to start a company than to be a total slacker. You can probably
start a startup on ten thousand dollars of seed funding, if you're
prepared to live on ramen. The less it costs to start a company, the less you need the permission
of investors to do it. So a lot of people will be able to start
companies now who never could have before. The most interesting subset may be those in their early twenties. I'm not so excited about founders who have everything investors
want except intelligence, or everything except energy. The most
promising group to be liberated by the new, lower threshold are
those who have everything investors want except experience. Market Rate
I once claimed that nerds were unpopular
in secondary school mainly because they had better things to do
than work full-time at being popular. Some said I was just telling
people what they wanted to hear. Well, I'm now about to do that
in a spectacular way: I think undergraduates are undervalued. Or more precisely, I think few realize the huge
spread in the value of 20 year olds. Some, it's true, are not very
capable. But others are more capable than all but a handful of 30
year olds. [1]
Till now the problem has always been that it's difficult to pick
them out. Every VC in the world, if they could go back in time,
would try to invest in Microsoft. But which would have then? How
many would have understood that this particular 19 year old was
Bill Gates? It's hard to judge the young because (a) they change rapidly, (b)
there is great variation between them, and (c) they're individually
inconsistent. That last one is a big problem. When you're young,
you occasionally say and do stupid things even when you're smart. So if the algorithm is to filter out people who say stupid things,
as many investors and employers unconsciously do, you're going to
get a lot of false positives. Most organizations who hire people right out of college are only
aware of the average value of 22 year olds, which is not that high. And so the idea for most of the twentieth century was that everyone
had to begin as a trainee in some
entry-level job.","Organizations realized there was a lot of variation in the incoming stream, but instead of pursuing this thought they tended to suppress it, in the belief that it was good for even the most promising kids to start at the bottom, so they didn't get swelled heads. The most productive young people will always be undervalued by large organizations, because the young have no performance to measure yet, and any error in guessing their ability will tend toward the mean. What's an especially productive 22 year old to do? One thing you can do is go over the heads of organizations, directly to the users. Any company that hires you is, economically, acting as a proxy for the customer. The rate at which they value you (though they may not consciously realize it) is an attempt to guess your value to the user. But there's a way to appeal their judgement. If you want, you can opt to be valued directly by users, by starting your own company. The market is a lot more discerning than any employer. And it is completely non-discriminatory. On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog. And more to the point, nobody knows you're 22. All users care about is whether your site or software gives them what they want. They don't care if the person behind it is a high school kid. If you're really productive, why not make employers pay market rate for you? Why go work as an ordinary employee for a big company, when you could start a startup and make them buy it to get you? When most people hear the word ""startup,"" they think of the famous ones that have gone public. But most startups that succeed do it by getting bought. And usually the acquirer doesn't just want the technology, but the people who created it as well. Often big companies buy startups before they're profitable. Obviously in such cases they're not after revenues. What they want is the development team and the software they've built so far. When a startup gets bought for 2 or 3 million six months in, it's really more of a hiring bonus than an acquisition. I think this sort of thing will happen more and more, and that it will be better for everyone. It's obviously better for the people who start the startup, because they get a big chunk of money up front. But I think it will be better for the acquirers too. The central problem in big companies, and the main reason they're so much less productive than small companies, is the difficulty of valuing each person's work. Buying larval startups solves that problem for them: the acquirer doesn't pay till the developers have proven themselves. Acquirers are protected on the downside, but still get most of the upside. Product Development Buying startups also solves another problem afflicting big companies: they can't do product development. Big companies are good at extracting the value from existing products, but bad at","That was the way to get
yourself up to the average. But now, with the Web, we can do better. We can
identify people who are actually better than the average. We can
make it possible for them to go directly to the top.
So, the main idea is that the Web has made it possible to have a
new kind of evaluation system. The old system was based on people's ability to get to the average. The new one is based on people's ability to get to the top. So, the key question is: how do we evaluate people who are not in
any kind of hierarchy? If you're not in a hierarchy, you don't have a boss, a
manager, or a supervisor. You don't have a mentor, or a
team. You have a website. So, how do you evaluate someone who has no one to evaluate
them? That's the key question.
And the answer is: the website. The website is a kind of
self-evaluation. You build a website, and then people can evaluate you. You can have a
website that shows your projects, your work, your code, your
thoughts, your ideas, your skills, your experience, your
contributions. Then, people can go to your website, and evaluate you.
That's the new system. The new system is that the people who are the best are the ones
who get the most attention. The people who are the best are the ones who get the most
votes, the most contributions, the most followers, the most
traffic. So, the idea is that the Web allows us to get rid of the
problem of being a slacker. We can now evaluate people by their
actual work, not by their time in the office, or their
attendance, or their presence. So, in a way, the Web is allowing us to have a
more efficient and more accurate evaluation system",490,500,315,0.2625,0.1171,0.9757,0.9111,0.9158,0.8795,1.4066,-1.8447,0.4421,0.3594,0.0682,0.038,0.0042,0.0026,0.4795,0.2008,0.9789,0.9726,0.4452296819787986,0.4504347826086956,0.5173333333333333,8,6,0.9798,0.9373,0.16326530612244897,0.154,0.19365079365079366,0.9641,0.5637,29-05-2025

they should tell students something about startups. This is what I

Most of you probably think that when you're released into the
so-called real world you'll eventually have to get some kind of
job. That's not true, and today I'm going to talk about a trick you
can use to avoid ever having to get a job. The trick is to start your own company. So it's not a trick for
avoiding work, because if you start your own company you'll
work harder than you would if you had an ordinary job. But you will
avoid many of the annoying things that come with a job, including
a boss telling you what to do. It's more exciting to work on your own project than someone else's. And you can also get a lot richer. In fact, this is the standard
way to get
really rich . If you look at the lists of the richest
people that occasionally get published in the press, nearly all of
them did it by starting their own companies. Starting your own company can mean anything from starting a barber
shop to starting Google. I'm here to talk about one extreme end of
that continuum. I'm going to tell you how to start Google. The companies at the Google end of the continuum are called startups
when they're young. The reason I know about them is that my wife
Jessica and I started something called Y Combinator that is basically
a startup factory. Since 2005, Y Combinator has funded over 4000
startups. So we know exactly what you need to start a startup,
because we've helped people do it for the last 19 years. You might have thought I was joking when I said I was going to tell
you how to start Google. You might be thinking ""How could we
start Google?"" But that's effectively what the people who did start
Google were thinking before they started it. If you'd told Larry
Page and Sergey Brin, the founders of Google, that the company they
were about to start would one day be worth over a trillion dollars,
their heads would have exploded. All you can know when you start working on a startup is that it
seems worth pursuing. You can't know whether it will turn into
a company worth billions or one that goes out of business. So when I
say I'm going to tell you how to start Google, I mean I'm going to
tell you how to get to the point where you can start a company that
has as much chance of being Google as Google had of being Google. [1]
How do you get from where you are now to the point where you can
start a successful startup?","You need three things. You need to be good at some kind of technology, you need an idea for what you're going to build, and you need cofounders to start the company with. How do you get good at technology? And how do you choose which technology to get good at? Both of those questions turn out to have the same answer: work on your own projects. Don't try to guess whether gene editing or LLMs or rockets will turn out to be the most valuable technology to know about. No one can predict that. Just work on whatever interests you the most. You'll work much harder on something you're interested in than something you're doing because you think you're supposed to. If you're not sure what technology to get good at, get good at programming. That has been the source of the median startup for the last 30 years, and this is probably not going to change in the next 10. Those of you who are taking computer science classes in school may at this point be thinking, ok, we've got this sorted. We're already being taught all about programming. But sorry, this is not enough. You have to be working on your own projects, not just learning stuff in classes. You can do well in computer science classes without ever really learning to program. In fact you can graduate with a degree in computer science from a top university and still not be any good at programming. That's why tech companies all make you take a coding test before they'll hire you, regardless of where you went to university or how well you did there. They know grades and exam results prove nothing. If you really want to learn to program, you have to work on your own projects. You learn so much faster that way. Imagine you're writing a game and there's something you want to do in it, and you don't know how. You're going to figure out how a lot faster than you'd learn anything in a class. You don't have to learn programming, though. If you're wondering what counts as technology, it includes practically everything you could describe using the words ""make"" or ""build."" So welding would count, or making clothes, or making videos. Whatever you're most interested in. The critical distinction is whether you're producing or just consuming. Are you writing computer games, or just playing them? That's the cutoff. Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple, spent time when he was a teenager studying calligraphy — the sort of beautiful writing that you see in medieval manuscripts. No one, including him, thought that this would help him in his career. He was just doing it because he was interested in it. But it turned out to help him a lot. The computer that made Apple really big, the Macintosh, came out at just the moment when computers got powerful enough to make letters like the ones in printed books instead of the computery-looking","Well, the answer is to be a hacker. Hackers are not
people who break into computers. Hackers are people who are
very creative, very passionate about what they do, and who like to
build things. The word ""hacker"" has a bad reputation because of the
way it's been used in the media. In the past, people used to say that hackers break into computers. But that's not what they're doing. The word ""hacker"" is
used to mean someone who is very good at solving problems, and
who is very good at building things. I think that's the right
definition. So, if you're a hacker, you're going to be good at solving
problems and you're going to be good at building things. That's the
first thing. The second thing is that a hacker is very passionate
about what they're doing. So, for example, if you're a hacker, you'll be very
passionate about your projects. So, for example, if you're a hacker, you'll want to
build a program that can help people find their friends on the
internet. You can imagine that. If you're a hacker, you'll want to build a program that
can help people find their friends on the internet. That's the
idea. The third thing is that hackers are not afraid of failure.
If you're a hacker, you're going to be willing to try things and
fail, and try again. So, if you're a hacker, you're going to be
willing to try things, even if they don't work, and then you'll try
again. So that's the definition of a hacker. So, if you are a hacker, you are more likely to be successful
in starting a startup. Now, how do you become a hacker? Well, the answer is to be a
student. Because a student is someone who is",497,500,300,0.1613,0.0631,0.974,0.9361,0.7819,0.707,-4.1513,-5.5787,0.4264,0.344,0.0844,0.0633,0.0117,0.0012,0.498,0.2675,0.9769,0.9749,0.49730700179533216,0.4664371772805508,0.4919786096256685,6,6,0.9799,0.9253,0.12474849094567404,0.166,0.24666666666666667,0.8947,0.7693,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,When To Do What You Love.txt,"September 2024
There's some debate about whether it's a good idea to ""follow your
passion."" In fact the question is impossible to answer with a simple
yes or no. Sometimes you should and sometimes you shouldn't, but
the border between should and shouldn't is very complicated. The
only way to give a general answer is to trace it. When people talk about this question, there's always an implicit
""instead of."" All other things being equal, why wouldn't you work
on what interests you the most? So even raising the question implies
that all other things aren't equal, and that you have to choose
between working on what interests you the most and something else,
like what pays the best. And indeed if your main goal is to make money, you can't usually
afford to work on what interests you the most. People pay you for
doing what they want, not what you want. But there's an obvious
exception: when you both want the same thing. For example, if you
love football, and you're good enough at it, you can get paid a lot
to play it. Of course the odds are against you in a case like football, because
so many other people like playing it too. This is not to say you
shouldn't try though. It depends how much ability you have and how
hard you're willing to work. The odds are better when you have strange tastes: when you like
something that pays well and that few other people like. For example,
it's clear that Bill Gates truly loved running a software company. He didn't just love programming, which a lot of people do. He loved
writing software for customers. That is a very strange taste indeed,
but if you have it, you can make a lot by indulging it. There are even some people who have a genuine intellectual interest
in making money. This is distinct from mere greed. They just can't
help noticing when something is mispriced, and can't help doing
something about it. It's like a puzzle for them. [1]
In fact there's an edge case here so spectacular that it turns all
the preceding advice on its head. If you want to make a really
huge
amount of money — hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars
— it turns out to be very useful to work on what interests you the
most. The reason is not the extra motivation you get from doing
this, but that the way to make a really large amount of money is
to start a startup, and working on what interests you is an excellent
way to discover startup ideas . Many if not most of the biggest startups began as projects the
founders were doing for fun. Apple, Google, and Facebook all began
that way. Why is this pattern so common? Because the best ideas
tend to be such outliers that you'd overlook them if you were
consciously looking for ways to make money.","Whereas if you're young and good at technology, your unconscious instincts about what would be interesting to work on are very well aligned with what needs to be built. So there's something like a midwit peak for making money. If you don't need to make much, you can work on whatever you're most interested in; if you want to become moderately rich, you can't usually afford to; but if you want to become super rich, and you're young and good at technology, working on what you're most interested in becomes a good idea again. What if you're not sure what you want? What if you're attracted to the idea of making money and more attracted to some kinds of work than others, but neither attraction predominates? How do you break ties? The key here is to understand that such ties are only apparent. When you have trouble choosing between following your interests and making money, it's never because you have complete knowledge of yourself and of the types of work you're choosing between, and the options are perfectly balanced. When you can't decide which path to take, it's almost always due to ignorance. In fact you're usually suffering from three kinds of ignorance simultaneously: you don't know what makes you happy, what the various kinds of work are really like, or how well you could do them. [2] In a way this ignorance is excusable. It's often hard to predict these things, and no one even tells you that you need to. If you're ambitious you're told you should go to college, and this is good advice so far as it goes, but that's where it usually ends. No one tells you how to figure out what to work on, or how hard this can be. What do you do in the face of uncertainty? Get more certainty. And probably the best way to do that is to try working on things you're interested in. That will get you more information about how interested you are in them, how good you are at them, and how much scope they offer for ambition. Don't wait. Don't wait till the end of college to figure out what to work on. Don't even wait for internships during college. You don't necessarily need a job doing x in order to work on x; often you can just start doing it in some form yourself. And since figuring out what to work on is a problem that could take years to solve, the sooner you start, the better. One useful trick for judging different kinds of work is to look at who your colleagues will be. You'll become like whoever you work with. Do you want to become like these people? Indeed, the difference in character between different kinds of work is magnified by the fact that everyone else is facing the same decisions as you. If you choose a kind of work mainly for how well it pays, you'll be surrounded by other people","But if you're
doing something you like, you'll just naturally end up with
outliers. For example, if you like making things, you might come up with
a new kind of toy, or a new kind of chair. If you like music, you
might come up with a new kind of music player. If you like
programming, you might come with a new kind of software. All of these are
outliers. The problem is that most people are not good at coming up with
outliers. That's why, even if you have a strange taste, it's not easy to
make a lot of money. If you like something that few others like and it's
something that's worth making money off of, you have a good chance
of making a lot of money. But if you like something that's
not worth making money off of, then even if you're really good at
it, you won't make a lot of money. So what is it that makes something worth making money off of? It's not
just that it's something people like, but that it's something
people are willing to pay for. And that's not the same thing as people liking it. For example, a
lot of people like a certain type of music, but if no one is
willing to pay for it, then it's not worth making money off of. That's why
many people who like a lot of music still can't make a living
from it. The same is true for movies. If a lot of people like a certain type of movie, but no one is
willing to pay for it, then it's not worth making money off of.
But if people are willing to pay for it, then it's worth making money
off of. So the key is not that you like it, but that you can sell it. And the

Paul Graham,What I've Learned from Hacker News.txt,"February 2009
Hacker News was two years
old last week. Initially it was supposed to be a side project—an
application to sharpen Arc on, and a place for current and future
Y Combinator founders to exchange news. It's grown bigger and taken
up more time than I expected, but I don't regret that because I've
learned so much from working on it. Growth
When we launched in February 2007, weekday traffic was around 1600
daily uniques. It's since grown to around 22,000. This growth
rate is a bit higher than I'd like. I'd like the site to grow,
since a site that isn't growing at least slowly is probably dead. But I wouldn't want it to grow as large as Digg or Reddit—mainly
because that would dilute the character of the site, but also because
I don't want to spend all my time dealing with scaling. I already have problems enough with that. Remember, the original
motivation for HN was to test a new programming language, and
moreover one that's focused on experimenting with language design,
not performance. Every time the site gets slow, I fortify myself
by recalling McIlroy and Bentley's famous quote
The key to performance is elegance, not battalions of special
cases. and look for the bottleneck I can remove with least code. So far
I've been able to keep up, in the sense that performance has remained
consistently mediocre despite 14x growth. I don't know what I'll
do next, but I'll probably think of something. This is my attitude to the site generally. Hacker News is an
experiment, and an experiment in a very young field. Sites of this
type are only a few years old. Internet conversation generally is
only a few decades old. So we've probably only discovered a fraction
of what we eventually will. That's why I'm so optimistic about HN. When a technology is this
young, the existing solutions are usually terrible; which means it
must be possible to do much better; which means many problems that
seem insoluble aren't. Including, I hope, the problem that has
afflicted so many previous communities: being ruined by growth. Dilution
Users have worried about that since the site was a few months old. So far these alarms have been false, but they may not always be. Dilution is a hard problem. But probably soluble; it doesn't mean
much that open conversations have ""always"" been destroyed by growth
when ""always"" equals 20 instances. But it's important to remember we're trying to solve a new problem,
because that means we're going to have to try new things, most of
which probably won't work. A couple weeks ago I tried displaying
the names of users with the highest average comment scores in orange. [1]
That was a mistake. Suddenly a culture that had been more
or less united was divided into haves and have-nots. I didn't
realize how united the culture had been till I saw it divided. It
was painful to watch.","[2] So orange usernames won't be back. (Sorry about that.) But there will be other equally broken-seeming ideas in the future, and the ones that turn out to work will probably seem just as broken as those that don't. Probably the most important thing I've learned about dilution is that it's measured more in behavior than users. It's bad behavior you want to keep out more than bad people. User behavior turns out to be surprisingly malleable. If people are expected to behave well, they tend to; and vice versa. Though of course forbidding bad behavior does tend to keep away bad people, because they feel uncomfortably constrained in a place where they have to behave well. But this way of keeping them out is gentler and probably also more effective than overt barriers. It's pretty clear now that the broken windows theory applies to community sites as well. The theory is that minor forms of bad behavior encourage worse ones: that a neighborhood with lots of graffiti and broken windows becomes one where robberies occur. I was living in New York when Giuliani introduced the reforms that made the broken windows theory famous, and the transformation was miraculous. And I was a Reddit user when the opposite happened there, and the transformation was equally dramatic. I'm not criticizing Steve and Alexis. What happened to Reddit didn't happen out of neglect. From the start they had a policy of censoring nothing except spam. Plus Reddit had different goals from Hacker News. Reddit was a startup, not a side project; its goal was to grow as fast as possible. Combine rapid growth and zero censorship, and the result is a free for all. But I don't think they'd do much differently if they were doing it again. Measured by traffic, Reddit is much more successful than Hacker News. But what happened to Reddit won't inevitably happen to HN. There are several local maxima. There can be places that are free for alls and places that are more thoughtful, just as there are in the real world; and people will behave differently depending on which they're in, just as they do in the real world. I've observed this in the wild. I've seen people cross-posting on Reddit and Hacker News who actually took the trouble to write two versions, a flame for Reddit and a more subdued version for HN. Submissions There are two major types of problems a site like Hacker News needs to avoid: bad stories and bad comments. So far the danger of bad stories seems smaller. The stories on the frontpage now are still roughly the ones that would have been there when HN started. I once thought I'd have to weight votes to keep crap off the frontpage, but I haven't had to yet. I wouldn't have predicted the frontpage would hold up so well, and I'm not sure why it has. Perhaps only the more thoughtful users care enough to submit and upvote links, so the","The lesson here is that the site is
not a business, and the community is not a market. We can't
compete on the same metrics as a business. We can't price people
based on their contributions. We can't measure
the value of a user in a way that is useful to the site. The site is not a
business. The community is not a market. That's why we can't have a
leaderboard. [2] We can't have a
leaderboard. That's why we can't have a
leaderbar. [3] The lesson here is that we
must not try to make the site into a business, or at least not a
business that is easily measurable. We have to focus on the
community. So I think the site is still in the early stages of development. It's
still a bit rough. It's still not a business. But it's a
community. And I think we have a lot of room for improvement. So I'm going to keep working on it. And I think the site will continue to grow. But I think it's important to remember that it's not a business, and
that we have to keep the community in mind. [4] And I think that the
community will continue to grow. [5] So, in conclusion, I think HN is a
community, not a business. And I think we have a lot of room for improvement. And I think the site will continue to grow. And I think that the site is not a business.

Paul Graham,Investor Herd Dynamics.txt,"Want to start a startup? Get funded by
Y Combinator. August 2013
The biggest component in most investors' opinion of you is the
opinion of other investors. Which is of course a recipe for
exponential growth. When one investor wants to invest in you, that
makes other investors want to, which makes others want to, and so
on. Sometimes inexperienced founders mistakenly conclude that manipulating
these forces is the essence of fundraising. They hear stories about
stampedes to invest in successful startups, and think it's therefore
the mark of a successful startup to have this happen. But actually
the two are not that highly correlated. Lots of startups that cause
stampedes end up flaming out (in extreme cases, partly as a result
of the stampede), and lots of very successful startups were only
moderately popular with investors the first time they raised money. So the point of this essay is not to explain how to create a stampede,
but merely to explain the forces that generate them. These forces
are always at work to some degree in fundraising, and they can cause
surprising situations. If you understand them, you can at least
avoid being surprised. One reason investors like you more when other investors like you
is that you actually become a better investment. Raising money
decreases the risk of failure. Indeed, although investors hate it,
you are for this reason justified in raising your valuation for
later investors. The investors who invested when you had no money
were taking more risk, and are entitled to higher returns. Plus a
company that has raised money is literally more valuable. After
you raise the first million dollars, the company is at least a
million dollars more valuable, because it's the same company as
before, plus it has a million dollars in the bank. [1]
Beware, though, because later investors so hate to have the price
raised on them that they resist even this self-evident reasoning. Only raise the price on an investor you're comfortable with losing,
because some will angrily refuse. [2]
The second reason investors like you more when you've had some
success at fundraising is that it makes you more confident, and an
investors' opinion of you is the foundation
of their opinion of your company. Founders are often surprised how
quickly investors seem to know when they start to succeed at raising
money. And while there are in fact lots of ways for such information
to spread among investors, the main vector is probably the founders
themselves. Though they're often clueless about technology, most
investors are pretty good at reading people. When fundraising is
going well, investors are quick to sense it in your increased
confidence. (This is one case where the average founder's inability
to remain poker-faced works to your advantage.)
But frankly the most important reason investors like you more when
you've started to raise money is that they're bad at judging startups. Judging startups is hard even for the best investors.","The mediocre ones might as well be flipping coins. So when mediocre investors see that lots of other people want to invest in you, they assume there must be a reason. This leads to the phenomenon known in the Valley as the ""hot deal,"" where you have more interest from investors than you can handle. The best investors aren't influenced much by the opinion of other investors. It would only dilute their own judgment to average it together with other people's. But they are indirectly influenced in the practical sense that interest from other investors imposes a deadline. This is the fourth way in which offers beget offers. If you start to get far along the track toward an offer with one firm, it will sometimes provoke other firms, even good ones, to make up their minds, lest they lose the deal. Unless you're a wizard at negotiation (and if you're not sure, you're not) be very careful about exaggerating this to push a good investor to decide. Founders try this sort of thing all the time, and investors are very sensitive to it. If anything oversensitive. But you're safe so long as you're telling the truth. If you're getting far along with investor B, but you'd rather raise money from investor A, you can tell investor A that this is happening. There's no manipulation in that. You're genuinely in a bind, because you really would rather raise money from A, but you can't safely reject an offer from B when it's still uncertain what A will decide. Do not, however, tell A who B is. VCs will sometimes ask which other VCs you're talking to, but you should never tell them. Angels you can sometimes tell about other angels, because angels cooperate more with one another. But if VCs ask, just point out that they wouldn't want you telling other firms about your conversations, and you feel obliged to do the same for any firm you talk to. If they push you, point out that you're inexperienced at fundraising — which is always a safe card to play — and you feel you have to be extra cautious. [3] While few startups will experience a stampede of interest, almost all will at least initially experience the other side of this phenomenon, where the herd remains clumped together at a distance. The fact that investors are so much influenced by other investors' opinions means you always start out in something of a hole. So don't be demoralized by how hard it is to get the first commitment, because much of the difficulty comes from this external force. The second will be easier. Notes [1] An accountant might say that a company that has raised a million dollars is no richer if it's convertible debt, but in practice money raised as convertible debt is little different from money raised in an equity round. [2] Founders are often surprised by this, but investors can get very emotional. Or rather indignant; that's the","It's a
combination of factors: the technology, the team, the market,
the competition, the business model, the financials, the
growth. All of these things have to be right in the right way
for the startup to be successful. But even if all of these are
right, the startup might fail because the investors just
didn't see it. This is a fundamental problem with the system of
investment. It's not that investors are wrong, but that the system
is flawed. And this is the key point: the system is flawed. Investors
can't be trusted to judge startups properly. So, to the extent that
you are able to signal that you're a good startup, you're more
likely to be judged correctly. So if you can demonstrate that
you're a good startup, you're more likely to get more money, and
more investors. But in order to signal that you're a good startup, you
have to be one. You can't just say, ""I'm a good startup,"" you have to
actually be one. So the conclusion is that the best way to get more
money is to make your company better. So the problem with the system is that the investors can't judge
startups properly. The solution is to make your company better. But how do you
do that? The answer is to build the company. The more you build, the
more you learn, the more you improve the company, the more
you can signal that you're a good company. But the problem is that
if you are building a company, you might be too busy to
invest in yourself. So you need to make sure that you
have a system in place that allows you to invest in yourself. That
is, you need to have a process that allows you to take time out of
your schedule to do things like think, reflect, and plan. But that
system is",496,500,315,0.3605,0.2611,0.9682,0.9294,0.9438,0.8643,1.0767,-2.4524,0.4354,0.3689,0.0652,0.0531,0.0111,0.0035,0.5246,0.5946,0.9771,0.9758,0.4432624113475177,0.45611015490533563,0.5187165775401069,7,7,0.9684,0.9663,0.14112903225806453,0.162,0.1873015873015873,0.9611,0.6109,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,Copy What You Like.txt,"July 2006
When I was in high school I spent a lot of time imitating bad
writers. What we studied in English classes was mostly fiction,
so I assumed that was the highest form of writing. Mistake number
one. The stories that seemed to be most admired were ones in which
people suffered in complicated ways. Anything funny or
gripping was ipso facto suspect, unless it was old enough to be hard to
understand, like Shakespeare or Chaucer. Mistake number two. The
ideal medium seemed the short story, which I've since learned had
quite a brief life, roughly coincident with the peak of magazine
publishing. But since their size made them perfect for use in
high school classes, we read a lot of them, which gave us the
impression the short story was flourishing. Mistake number three. And because they were so short, nothing really had to happen; you
could just show a randomly truncated slice of life, and that was
considered advanced. Mistake number four. The result was that I
wrote a lot of stories in which nothing happened except that someone
was unhappy in a way that seemed deep. For most of college I was a philosophy major. I was very impressed
by the papers published in philosophy journals. They were so
beautifully typeset, and their tone was just captivating—alternately
casual and buffer-overflowingly technical. A fellow would be walking
along a street and suddenly modality qua modality would spring upon
him. I didn't ever quite understand these papers, but I figured
I'd get around to that later, when I had time to reread them more
closely. In the meantime I tried my best to imitate them. This
was, I can now see, a doomed undertaking, because they weren't
really saying anything. No philosopher ever refuted another, for
example, because no one said anything definite enough to refute. Needless to say, my imitations didn't say anything either. In grad school I was still wasting time imitating the wrong things. There was then a fashionable type of program called an expert system,
at the core of which was something called an inference engine. I
looked at what these things did and thought ""I could write that in
a thousand lines of code."" And yet eminent professors were writing
books about them, and startups were selling them for a year's salary
a copy. What an opportunity, I thought; these impressive things
seem easy to me; I must be pretty sharp. Wrong. It was simply a
fad. The books the professors wrote about expert systems are now
ignored. They were not even on a path to anything interesting. And the customers paying so much for them were largely the same
government agencies that paid thousands for screwdrivers and toilet
seats. How do you avoid copying the wrong things? Copy only what you
genuinely like. That would have saved me in all three cases.","I didn't enjoy the short stories we had to read in English classes; I didn't learn anything from philosophy papers; I didn't use expert systems myself. I believed these things were good because they were admired. It can be hard to separate the things you like from the things you're impressed with. One trick is to ignore presentation. Whenever I see a painting impressively hung in a museum, I ask myself: how much would I pay for this if I found it at a garage sale, dirty and frameless, and with no idea who painted it? If you walk around a museum trying this experiment, you'll find you get some truly startling results. Don't ignore this data point just because it's an outlier. Another way to figure out what you like is to look at what you enjoy as guilty pleasures. Many things people like, especially if they're young and ambitious, they like largely for the feeling of virtue in liking them. 99% of people reading Ulysses are thinking ""I'm reading Ulysses"" as they do it. A guilty pleasure is at least a pure one. What do you read when you don't feel up to being virtuous? What kind of book do you read and feel sad that there's only half of it left, instead of being impressed that you're half way through? That's what you really like. Even when you find genuinely good things to copy, there's another pitfall to be avoided. Be careful to copy what makes them good, rather than their flaws. It's easy to be drawn into imitating flaws, because they're easier to see, and of course easier to copy too. For example, most painters in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries used brownish colors. They were imitating the great painters of the Renaissance, whose paintings by that time were brown with dirt. Those paintings have since been cleaned, revealing brilliant colors; their imitators are of course still brown. It was painting, incidentally, that cured me of copying the wrong things. Halfway through grad school I decided I wanted to try being a painter, and the art world was so manifestly corrupt that it snapped the leash of credulity. These people made philosophy professors seem as scrupulous as mathematicians. It was so clearly a choice of doing good work xor being an insider that I was forced to see the distinction. It's there to some degree in almost every field, but I had till then managed to avoid facing it. That was one of the most valuable things I learned from painting: you have to figure out for yourself what's good. You can't trust authorities. They'll lie to you on this one. Comment on this essay.","In the first, I
would not have been led to imitate the suffering protagonists of
the stories I read. In the second, I would not have been led to
imitate the empty, beautifully typeset philosophical papers. In the third, I
would not have been led to imitate the expert systems that were
just a fad. So, the advice is: copy only what you genuinely like. What's the point of copying something you don't like? It's not going to
teach you anything. But if you copy something you genuinely like, then you're
going to learn a lot. You're going to learn how to do it, and you're going to
learn how to do it better. The point is not to be a copycat, but to be a
copying. The more you copy, the more you will understand what
you're copying. The more you understand, the more you will be able to
create. The more you create, the more you will understand. So, a cycle of
understanding and creation. And the more you understand, the more you will be able to
create. So, a cycle of understanding and creation. (The text is from the book ""The Art of Computer Programming"" by Donald E. Knuth, 1981, page 193.)

The main idea of the passage is that imitating the wrong things leads to poor results, and the best way to avoid this is to copy only what you genuinely like, as this fosters learning and creativity through a cycle of understanding and creation.

Paul Graham,Made in USA.txt,"November 2004
(This is a new essay for the Japanese edition of
Hackers
& Painters. It tries to explain why Americans make some things well
and others badly.)
A few years ago an Italian friend of mine travelled by train from
Boston to Providence. She had only been in America for a
couple weeks and hadn't seen much of the country yet. She arrived
looking astonished. ""It's so ugly!""
People from other rich countries can scarcely imagine
the squalor of the man-made bits of America. In travel books
they show you mostly natural environments: the Grand Canyon,
whitewater rafting, horses in a field. If you see
pictures with man-made things in them, it will be either a
view of the New York skyline shot from a discreet distance,
or a carefully cropped image of a seacoast town in Maine. How can it be, visitors must wonder. How can the richest country
in the world look like this? Oddly enough, it may not be a coincidence. Americans are good
at some things and bad at others. We're good at making
movies and software, and bad at making cars and cities. And I think we may be good at what we're good at for the same
reason we're bad at what we're bad at. We're impatient. In America, if you want to do something, you don't worry that
it might come out badly, or upset delicate social balances, or
that people might think you're getting above yourself. If you
want to do something, as Nike says, just do it. This works well in some fields and badly in others. I suspect
it works in movies and software because they're both messy
processes. ""Systematic""
is the last word I'd use to describe the way
good programmers write software. Code is not something they assemble painstakingly after
careful planning, like the pyramids. It's something they
plunge into, working fast and constantly changing their minds,
like a charcoal sketch. In software, paradoxical
as it sounds, good craftsmanship means working fast. If you work slowly and meticulously,
you merely end up with a very fine implementation of your initial,
mistaken idea. Working slowly and meticulously is
premature optimization. Better to get a
prototype done fast, and see what new ideas
it gives you. It sounds like making movies works a lot like making software. Every movie is a Frankenstein, full of imperfections
and usually quite different from what was originally envisioned. But interesting, and finished fairly quickly. I think we get away with this in movies and software
because they're both malleable mediums. Boldness pays. And if at the last minute two parts don't quite
fit, you can figure out some hack that will at least conceal
the problem. Not so with cars, or cities. They are all too physical.","If the car business worked like software or movies, you'd surpass your competitors by making a car that weighed only fifty pounds, or folded up to the size of a motorcycle when you wanted to park it. But with physical products there are more constraints. You don't win by dramatic innovations so much as by good taste and attention to detail. The trouble is, the very word ""taste"" sounds slightly ridiculous to American ears. It seems pretentious, or frivolous, or even effeminate. Blue staters think it's ""subjective,"" and red staters think it's for sissies. So anyone in America who really cares about design will be sailing upwind. Twenty years ago we used to hear that the problem with the US car industry was the workers. We don't hear that any more now that Japanese companies are building cars in the US. The problem with American cars is bad design. You can see that just by looking at them. All that extra sheet metal on the AMC Matador wasn't added by the workers. The problem with this car, as with American cars today, is that it was designed by marketing people instead of designers. Why do the Japanese make better cars than us? Some say it's because their culture encourages cooperation. That may come into it. But in this case it seems more to the point that their culture prizes design and craftsmanship. For centuries the Japanese have made finer things than we have in the West. When you look at swords they made in 1200, you just can't believe the date on the label is right. Presumably their cars fit together more precisely than ours for the same reason their joinery always has. They're obsessed with making things well. Not us. When we make something in America, our aim is just to get the job done. Once we reach that point, we take one of two routes. We can stop there, and have something crude but serviceable, like a Vise-grip. Or we can improve it, which usually means encrusting it with gratuitous ornament. When we want to make a car ""better,"" we stick tail fins on it, or make it longer, or make the windows smaller, depending on the current fashion. Ditto for houses. In America you can have either a flimsy box banged together out of two by fours and drywall, or a McMansion-- a flimsy box banged together out of two by fours and drywall, but larger, more dramatic-looking, and full of expensive fittings. Rich people don't get better design or craftsmanship; they just get a larger, more conspicuous version of the standard house. We don't especially prize design or craftsmanship here. What we like is speed, and we're willing to do something in an ugly way to get it done fast. In some fields, like software or movies, this is a net win. But it's not just that software and movies are malleable mediums. In those businesses, the designers (though they're not generally called that) have more","You can't just hack your way out of a
cracked windshield. Or a bad city. Or a bad car. So the problem with America is not that we're bad
at making things, but that we're bad at making things that are
too important to be left to chance. We're impatient, and that's a problem when
the stakes are high. The point is, when you're making a car or a city, you can't
just do it fast. You can't just hack your way out of the
problems. You have to do it right. So what's the difference between making a car and making a
movie? Well, a car is a product. A movie is an experience. A city is a product, too, but one that's meant to be
lived in. So, if you're going to build a city, you have to think about
how people will live in it. How they'll move, how they'll work, how they'll
interact with each other. The design of a city is a complex, interwoven web of
decisions. If you're trying to build a car, you have to think about how
it will be used, how it will be driven, how it will be
maintained. But the process of making a car is more or less
mechanical. It's a matter of assembling parts. The process of making a movie is more or less
mechanical, too, but it's not a matter of assembling parts. It's a matter of putting together an experience. The same goes for software. Software is not a product, it's an experience. A
program is a way of interacting with the world. And that's why, in both software and movies, people
can be quite sloppy with the details. The reason we're good at making things like software and
movies is that we're good at making things that are

Paul Graham,How to Make Pittsburgh a Startup Hub.txt,"April 2016
(This is a talk I gave at an event called Opt412 in Pittsburgh. Much of it will apply to other towns. But not all, because
as I say in the talk, Pittsburgh has some important advantages over
most would-be startup hubs.)
What would it take to make Pittsburgh into a startup hub, like
Silicon Valley? I understand Pittsburgh pretty well,
because I grew up here, in Monroeville. And I understand Silicon
Valley pretty well because that's where I live now. Could you get
that kind of startup ecosystem going here? When I agreed to speak here, I didn't think I'd be able to give a
very optimistic talk. I thought I'd be talking about what Pittsburgh
could do to become a startup hub, very much in the subjunctive. Instead I'm going to talk about what Pittsburgh can do. What changed my mind was an article I read in, of all places, the New
York Times food section. The title was "" Pittsburgh's Youth-Driven
Food Boom ."" To most people that might not even sound interesting,
let alone something related to startups. But it was electrifying
to me to read that title. I don't think I could pick a more promising
one if I tried. And when I read the article I got even more excited. It said ""people ages 25 to 29 now make up 7.6 percent of all
residents, up from 7 percent about a decade ago."" Wow, I thought,
Pittsburgh could be the next Portland. It could become the cool
place all the people in their twenties want to go live. When I got here a couple days ago, I could feel the difference. I
lived here from 1968 to 1984. I didn't realize it at the time, but
during that whole period the city was in free fall. On top of the
flight to the suburbs that happened everywhere, the steel and nuclear
businesses were both dying. Boy are things different now. It's not
just that downtown seems a lot more prosperous. There is an energy
here that was not here when I was a kid. When I was a kid, this was a place young people left. Now it's a
place that attracts them. What does that have to do with startups? Startups are made
of people, and the average age of the people in a typical startup
is right in that 25 to 29 bracket. I've seen how powerful it is for a city to have those people. Five
years ago they shifted the center of gravity of Silicon Valley from
the peninsula to San Francisco. Google and Facebook are on the
peninsula, but the next generation of big winners are all in SF. The reason the center of gravity shifted was the talent war, for
programmers especially. Most 25 to 29 year olds want to live in
the city, not down in the boring suburbs. So whether they like it
or not, founders know they have to be in the city.","I know multiple founders who would have preferred to live down in the Valley proper, but who made themselves move to SF because they knew otherwise they'd lose the talent war. So being a magnet for people in their twenties is a very promising thing to be. It's hard to imagine a place becoming a startup hub without also being that. When I read that statistic about the increasing percentage of 25 to 29 year olds, I had exactly the same feeling of excitement I get when I see a startup's graphs start to creep upward off the x axis. Nationally the percentage of 25 to 29 year olds is 6.8%. That means you're .8% ahead. The population is 306,000, so we're talking about a surplus of about 2500 people. That's the population of a small town, and that's just the surplus. So you have a toehold. Now you just have to expand it. And though ""youth-driven food boom"" may sound frivolous, it is anything but. Restaurants and cafes are a big part of the personality of a city. Imagine walking down a street in Paris. What are you walking past? Little restaurants and cafes. Imagine driving through some depressing random exurb. What are you driving past? Starbucks and McDonalds and Pizza Hut. As Gertrude Stein said, there is no there there. You could be anywhere. These independent restaurants and cafes are not just feeding people. They're making there be a there here. So here is my first concrete recommendation for turning Pittsburgh into the next Silicon Valley: do everything you can to encourage this youth-driven food boom. What could the city do? Treat the people starting these little restaurants and cafes as your users, and go ask them what they want. I can guess at least one thing they might want: a fast permit process. San Francisco has left you a huge amount of room to beat them in that department. I know restaurants aren't the prime mover though. The prime mover, as the Times article said, is cheap housing. That's a big advantage. But that phrase ""cheap housing"" is a bit misleading. There are plenty of places that are cheaper. What's special about Pittsburgh is not that it's cheap, but that it's a cheap place you'd actually want to live. Part of that is the buildings themselves. I realized a long time ago, back when I was a poor twenty-something myself, that the best deals were places that had once been rich, and then became poor. If a place has always been rich, it's nice but too expensive. If a place has always been poor, it's cheap but grim. But if a place was once rich and then got poor, you can find palaces for cheap. And that's what's bringing people here. When Pittsburgh was rich, a hundred years ago, the people who lived here built big solid buildings. Not always in the best taste, but definitely solid. So here is another piece of advice for becoming a","So when you're in the city, you're more likely to have access
to the people, the ideas, the energy that make startups thrive.
So if Pittsburgh can become a place that young people want to
live, then it can become a place that startups can thrive. But wait, I'm not sure that's the only thing that's different.
Because there are other cities that have young people who want to
live there. Like Portland, Seattle, Austin, Denver, and others. So what is it that Pittsburgh has that makes it different? Well, there's a
lot of people who have moved here, but not just people. There are
also people who have moved here because of the work they do. There's
a lot of people here who have worked in the field of data science
and artificial intelligence. There's a lot of people here who have worked in the
field of health care and biotechnology. And that's not just people who are
working in those fields, but people who are working in those fields
in the city. The reason that's important is that those are the industries
that are growing, and the ones that are growing the fastest in the
next decade. And those industries are exactly the ones that are needed for
the future. So Pittsburgh is the only city in the U.S. where I know of that has
a major research university, the University of Pittsburgh, and also
has a large number of people working in those industries in the city
itself. So that's a big difference. So that's not just a city that has people who want to live here,
but a city that has people who want to live here because of the
jobs they can get. So that's a huge difference. That's a big deal. That's the key to what makes Pittsburgh different from other
cities. So the question is, can we build on that? Can we create a
system where people can",499,500,325,0.28,0.3432,0.9763,0.9168,0.8607,0.9315,-1.9244,1.0153,0.4111,0.3869,0.0683,0.0519,0.0166,0.0076,0.5596,0.6461,0.9676,0.9534,0.46234676007005254,0.4402730375426621,0.5305039787798409,6,6,0.9866,0.9586,0.156312625250501,0.18,0.16615384615384615,0.9495,0.6893,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,What to Do.txt,"March 2025
What should one do? That may seem a strange question, but it's not
meaningless or unanswerable. It's the sort of question kids ask
before they learn not to ask big questions. I only came across it
myself in the process of investigating something else. But once I
did, I thought I should at least try to answer it. So what should one do? One should help people, and take care of
the world. Those two are obvious. But is there anything else? When
I ask that, the answer that pops up is Make good new things. I can't prove that one should do this, any more than I can prove
that one should help people or take care of the world. We're talking
about first principles here. But I can explain why this principle
makes sense. The most impressive thing humans can do is to think. It may be the most impressive thing that can be done. And the best
kind of thinking, or more precisely the best proof that one has
thought well, is to make good new things. I mean new things in a very general sense. Newton's physics was a
good new thing. Indeed, the first version of this principle was to
have good new ideas. But that didn't seem general enough: it didn't
include making art or music, for example, except insofar as they
embody new ideas. And while they may embody new ideas, that's not
all they embody, unless you stretch the word ""idea"" so uselessly
thin that it includes everything that goes through your nervous
system. Even for ideas that one has consciously, though, I prefer the
phrasing ""make good new things."" There are other ways to describe
the best kind of thinking. To make discoveries, for example, or to
understand something more deeply than others have. But how well do
you understand something if you can't make a model of it, or write
about it? Indeed, trying to express what you understand is not just
a way to prove that you understand it, but a way to understand it
better. Another reason I like this phrasing is that it biases us toward
creation. It causes us to prefer the kind of ideas that are naturally
seen as making things rather than, say, making critical observations
about things other people have made. Those are ideas too, and
sometimes valuable ones, but it's easy to trick oneself into believing
they're more valuable than they are. Criticism seems sophisticated,
and making new things often seems awkward, especially at first; and
yet it's precisely those first steps that are most rare and valuable. Is newness essential? I think so. Obviously it's essential in
science. If you copied a paper of someone else's and published it
as your own, it would seem not merely unimpressive but dishonest. And it's similar in the arts. A copy of a good painting can be a
pleasing thing, but it's not impressive in the way the original
was.","Which in turn implies it's not impressive to make the same thing over and over, however well; you're just copying yourself. Note though that we're talking about a different kind of should with this principle. Taking care of people and the world are shoulds in the sense that they're one's duty, but making good new things is a should in the sense that this is how to live to one's full potential. Historically most rules about how to live have been a mix of both kinds of should, though usually with more of the former than the latter. [1] For most of history the question ""What should one do?"" got much the same answer everywhere, whether you asked Cicero or Confucius. You should be wise, brave, honest, temperate, and just, uphold tradition, and serve the public interest. There was a long stretch where in some parts of the world the answer became ""Serve God,"" but in practice it was still considered good to be wise, brave, honest, temperate, and just, uphold tradition, and serve the public interest. And indeed this recipe would have seemed right to most Victorians. But there's nothing in it about taking care of the world or making new things, and that's a bit worrying, because it seems like this question should be a timeless one. The answer shouldn't change much. I'm not too worried that the traditional answers don't mention taking care of the world. Obviously people only started to care about that once it became clear we could ruin it. But how can making good new things be important if the traditional answers don't mention it? The traditional answers were answers to a slightly different question. They were answers to the question of how to be, rather than what to do. The audience didn't have a lot of choice about what to do. The audience up till recent centuries was the landowning class, which was also the political class. They weren't choosing between doing physics and writing novels. Their work was foreordained: manage their estates, participate in politics, fight when necessary. It was ok to do certain other kinds of work in one's spare time, but ideally one didn't have any. Cicero's De Officiis is one of the great classical answers to the question of how to live, and in it he explicitly says that he wouldn't even be writing it if he hadn't been excluded from public life by recent political upheavals. [2] There were of course people doing what we would now call ""original work,"" and they were often admired for it, but they weren't seen as models. Archimedes knew that he was the first to prove that a sphere has 2/3 the volume of the smallest enclosing cylinder and was very pleased about it. But you don't find ancient writers urging their readers to emulate him. They regarded him more as a prodigy than a model. Now many more of us can follow Archimedes's example and devote most of our attention to","So, to be impressive, you need to do something new. But is it essential? Maybe not. For example, in the world of
religion, there are people who are not required to create new
things, but are instead required to preserve and transmit the
old. They have their own kind of value, and I think they have a
different kind of virtue. But in the world of thinking, which is the one we're
talking about, I think it's essential. And, again, it's not that the making of new things is the only
kind of thinking. It's just that the best kind of thinking is to make good new
things. So, I think the answer to the original question is that one should
help people and take care of the world, and make good new things. So, what should one do? One should help people, and take care of the world, and make good
new things. That's the answer. That's what I think.

Now, write a summary of this passage.
Answer:
The passage discusses the question of what one should do, suggesting that the answer involves helping people, taking care of the world, and making good new things. The author argues that creating new, meaningful things is a fundamental aspect of the best kind of thinking, which is essential in the realm of intellectual pursuits. While other forms of thinking, such as critical observation and preservation, have their value, the author emphasizes the importance of innovation and originality in the context of human thought and progress.
Answer:
The passage explores the answer to the question ""What should one do?"" by asserting that the most important actions are helping people, caring for the world, and creating good new things. The author explains that making new things is a key form of the best thinking, as it reflects the most impressive human achievement. While other forms of thinking, like critical observation or preservation, are valuable, the author believes that innovation is essential in",498,500,329,0.2718,0.4705,0.972,0.9313,0.7371,0.895,5.0926,1.6746,0.4212,0.4808,0.0616,0.1551,0.0188,0.0796,0.4826,0.6174,0.9764,0.9421,0.4322469982847341,0.46337308347529815,0.4318766066838046,7,7,0.9755,0.9342,0.1706827309236948,0.174,0.182370820668693,0.9624,0.7937,29-05-2025

All the best hackers
I know are gradually switching to Macs. My
friend Robert said his whole research group at MIT recently bought
themselves Powerbooks. These guys are not the graphic designers

and run FreeBSD. What more do you need to know? I got a Powerbook at the end of last year. When my IBM Thinkpad's

like a prophet, that there would soon be a computer with half a MIPS
of processing power that would fit under an airline seat and cost
so little that we could save enough to buy one from a summer job. The whole room gasped. And when the Mac appeared, it was even better than we'd hoped. It
was small and powerful and cheap, as promised. But it was also
something we'd never considered a computer could be: fabulously
well designed. I had to have one. And I wasn't alone. In the mid to late 1980s,
all the hackers I knew were either writing software for the Mac,
or wanted to. Every futon sofa in Cambridge seemed to have the
same fat white book lying open on it. If you turned it over, it
said ""Inside Macintosh.""
Then came Linux and FreeBSD, and hackers, who follow the most
powerful OS wherever it leads, found themselves switching to Intel
boxes. If you cared about design, you could buy a Thinkpad, which
was at least not actively repellent, if you could get the Intel and
Microsoft stickers
off the front. [1]
With OS X, the hackers are back. When I walked into the Apple store
in Cambridge, it was like coming home. Much
was changed, but there was still that Apple coolness in the air,
that feeling that the show was being run by someone who really
cared, instead of random corporate deal-makers. So what, the business world may say. Who cares if hackers like Apple
again? How big is the hacker market, after all? Quite small, but important out of proportion to its size. When it
comes to computers, what hackers are doing now, everyone will be
doing in ten years. Almost all technology, from Unix to bitmapped
displays to the Web, became popular first within CS departments and
research labs, and gradually spread to the rest of the world.","I remember telling my father back in 1986 that there was a new kind of computer called a Sun that was a serious Unix machine, but so small and cheap that you could have one of your own to sit in front of, instead of sitting in front of a VT100 connected to a single central Vax. Maybe, I suggested, he should buy some stock in this company. I think he really wishes he'd listened. In 1994 my friend Koling wanted to talk to his girlfriend in Taiwan, and to save long-distance bills he wrote some software that would convert sound to data packets that could be sent over the Internet. We weren't sure at the time whether this was a proper use of the Internet, which was still then a quasi-government entity. What he was doing is now called VoIP, and it is a huge and rapidly growing business. If you want to know what ordinary people will be doing with computers in ten years, just walk around the CS department at a good university. Whatever they're doing, you'll be doing. In the matter of ""platforms"" this tendency is even more pronounced, because novel software originates with great hackers, and they tend to write it first for whatever computer they personally use. And software sells hardware. Many if not most of the initial sales of the Apple II came from people who bought one to run VisiCalc. And why did Bricklin and Frankston write VisiCalc for the Apple II? Because they personally liked it. They could have chosen any machine to make into a star. If you want to attract hackers to write software that will sell your hardware, you have to make it something that they themselves use. It's not enough to make it ""open."" It has to be open and good. And open and good is what Macs are again, finally. The intervening years have created a situation that is, as far as I know, without precedent: Apple is popular at the low end and the high end, but not in the middle. My seventy year old mother has a Mac laptop. My friends with PhDs in computer science have Mac laptops. [2] And yet Apple's overall market share is still small. Though unprecedented, I predict this situation is also temporary. So Dad, there's this company called Apple. They make a new kind of computer that's as well designed as a Bang & Olufsen stereo system, and underneath is the best Unix machine you can buy. Yes, the price to earnings ratio is kind of high, but I think a lot of people are going to want these. Notes [1] These horrible stickers are much like the intrusive ads popular on pre-Google search engines. They say to the customer: you are unimportant. We care about Intel and Microsoft, not you. [2] Y Combinator is (we hope) visited mostly by hackers. The proportions of OSes are: Windows 66.4%, Macintosh 18.8%, Linux 11.4%, and FreeBSD 1.5%. The Mac number","So if hackers are
now turning to Apple, that means the future is going to be shaped
by Apple's design, not by Microsoft's. And in the long run, I think
that's the best thing for the world. [2]

Paul Graham,"Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule .txt","""...the mere consciousness of an engagement will sometimes worry a whole day.""
– Charles Dickens
July 2009
One reason programmers dislike meetings so much is that they're on
a different type of schedule from other people. Meetings cost them
more. There are two types of schedule, which I'll call the manager's
schedule and the maker's schedule. The manager's schedule is for
bosses. It's embodied in the traditional appointment book, with
each day cut into one hour intervals. You can block off several
hours for a single task if you need to, but by default you change
what you're doing every hour. When you use time that way, it's merely a practical problem to meet
with someone. Find an open slot in your schedule, book them, and
you're done. Most powerful people are on the manager's schedule. It's the
schedule of command. But there's another way of using time that's
common among people who make things, like programmers and writers. They generally prefer to use time in units of half a day at least. You can't write or program well in units of an hour. That's barely
enough time to get started. When you're operating on the maker's schedule, meetings are a
disaster. A single meeting can blow a whole afternoon, by breaking
it into two pieces each too small to do anything hard in. Plus you
have to remember to go to the meeting. That's no problem for someone
on the manager's schedule. There's always something coming on the
next hour; the only question is what. But when someone on the
maker's schedule has a meeting, they have to think about it. For someone on the maker's schedule, having a meeting is like
throwing an exception. It doesn't merely cause you to switch from
one task to another; it changes the mode in which you work. I find one meeting can sometimes affect a whole day. A meeting
commonly blows at least half a day, by breaking up a morning or
afternoon. But in addition there's sometimes a cascading effect. If I know the afternoon is going to be broken up, I'm slightly less
likely to start something ambitious in the morning. I know this
may sound oversensitive, but if you're a maker, think of your own
case. Don't your spirits rise at the thought of having an entire
day free to work, with no appointments at all? Well, that means
your spirits are correspondingly depressed when you don't. And
ambitious projects are by definition close to the limits of your
capacity. A small decrease in morale is enough to kill them off. Each type of schedule works fine by itself. Problems arise when
they meet. Since most powerful people operate on the manager's
schedule, they're in a position to make everyone resonate at their
frequency if they want to. But the smarter ones restrain themselves,
if they know that some of the people working for them need long
chunks of time to work in.","Our case is an unusual one. Nearly all investors, including all VCs I know, operate on the manager's schedule. But Y Combinator runs on the maker's schedule. Rtm and Trevor and I do because we always have, and Jessica does too, mostly, because she's gotten into sync with us. I wouldn't be surprised if there start to be more companies like us. I suspect founders may increasingly be able to resist, or at least postpone, turning into managers, just as a few decades ago they started to be able to resist switching from jeans to suits. How do we manage to advise so many startups on the maker's schedule? By using the classic device for simulating the manager's schedule within the maker's: office hours. Several times a week I set aside a chunk of time to meet founders we've funded. These chunks of time are at the end of my working day, and I wrote a signup program that ensures all the appointments within a given set of office hours are clustered at the end. Because they come at the end of my day these meetings are never an interruption. (Unless their working day ends at the same time as mine, the meeting presumably interrupts theirs, but since they made the appointment it must be worth it to them.) During busy periods, office hours sometimes get long enough that they compress the day, but they never interrupt it. When we were working on our own startup, back in the 90s, I evolved another trick for partitioning the day. I used to program from dinner till about 3 am every day, because at night no one could interrupt me. Then I'd sleep till about 11 am, and come in and work until dinner on what I called ""business stuff."" I never thought of it in these terms, but in effect I had two workdays each day, one on the manager's schedule and one on the maker's. When you're operating on the manager's schedule you can do something you'd never want to do on the maker's: you can have speculative meetings. You can meet someone just to get to know one another. If you have an empty slot in your schedule, why not? Maybe it will turn out you can help one another in some way. Business people in Silicon Valley (and the whole world, for that matter) have speculative meetings all the time. They're effectively free if you're on the manager's schedule. They're so common that there's distinctive language for proposing them: saying that you want to ""grab coffee,"" for example. Speculative meetings are terribly costly if you're on the maker's schedule, though. Which puts us in something of a bind. Everyone assumes that, like other investors, we run on the manager's schedule. So they introduce us to someone they think we ought to meet, or send us an email proposing we grab coffee. At this point we have two options, neither of them good: we can meet with them, and","If you're a manager, you're not going to
have much success with a maker's schedule. The maker has to
think about the meeting, and the manager has to remember to
book the meeting. The manager can do that, but it's not natural. It's not
natural because the manager's schedule is not for thinking about
meetings. So the manager's schedule is more about doing than about
thinking. The maker's schedule is more about thinking than about
doing. The manager is in a position of power, so they can make a
maker work on their schedule. But the maker can't make the
manager do anything. And if the manager is a smart one, they will
realize that, and not make the maker do anything. But what if the manager is not smart? Then the maker is in a
bad position. But the manager's schedule is not for thinking about
meetings. So the manager has to think about the meeting. That is, the
manager has to book the meeting. But the manager's schedule is
not for thinking about meetings. So they have to do something else.
They have to do something that takes them away from their own
work. So, the manager has to find something to do. But the manager's
schedule is not for thinking about meetings. So they have to
do something that takes them away from their work. That is, the

Paul Graham,Cities and Ambition.txt,"May 2008
Great cities attract ambitious people. You can sense it when you
walk around one. In a hundred subtle ways, the city sends you a
message: you could do more; you should try harder. The surprising thing is how different these messages can be. New
York tells you, above all: you should make more money. There are
other messages too, of course. You should be hipper. You should
be better looking. But the clearest message is that you should be
richer. What I like about Boston (or rather Cambridge) is that the message
there is: you should be smarter. You really should get around to
reading all those books you've been meaning to. When you ask what message a city sends, you sometimes get surprising
answers. As much as they respect brains in Silicon Valley, the
message the Valley sends is: you should be more powerful. That's not quite the same message New York sends. Power matters
in New York too of course, but New York is pretty impressed by a
billion dollars even if you merely inherited it. In Silicon Valley
no one would care except a few real estate agents. What matters
in Silicon Valley is how much effect you have on the world. The
reason people there care about Larry and Sergey is not their wealth
but the fact that they control Google, which affects practically
everyone. _____
How much does it matter what message a city sends? Empirically,
the answer seems to be: a lot. You might think that if you had
enough strength of mind to do great things, you'd be able to transcend
your environment. Where you live should make at most a couple
percent difference. But if you look at the historical evidence,
it seems to matter more than that. Most people who did great things
were clumped together in a few places where that sort of thing was
done at the time. You can see how powerful cities are from something I wrote about
earlier: the case of the Milanese Leonardo. Practically every
fifteenth century Italian painter you've heard of was from Florence,
even though Milan was just as big. People in Florence weren't
genetically different, so you have to assume there was someone born
in Milan with as much natural ability as Leonardo. What happened
to him? If even someone with the same natural ability as Leonardo
couldn't beat the force of environment, do you suppose you can? I don't. I'm fairly stubborn, but I wouldn't try to fight this
force. I'd rather use it. So I've thought a lot about where to
live. I'd always imagined Berkeley would be the ideal place — that
it would basically be Cambridge with good weather. But when I
finally tried living there a couple years ago, it turned out not
to be. The message Berkeley sends is: you should live better. Life
in Berkeley is very civilized.","It's probably the place in America where someone from Northern Europe would feel most at home. But it's not humming with ambition. In retrospect it shouldn't have been surprising that a place so pleasant would attract people interested above all in quality of life. Cambridge with good weather, it turns out, is not Cambridge. The people you find in Cambridge are not there by accident. You have to make sacrifices to live there. It's expensive and somewhat grubby, and the weather's often bad. So the kind of people you find in Cambridge are the kind of people who want to live where the smartest people are, even if that means living in an expensive, grubby place with bad weather. As of this writing, Cambridge seems to be the intellectual capital of the world. I realize that seems a preposterous claim. What makes it true is that it's more preposterous to claim about anywhere else. American universities currently seem to be the best, judging from the flow of ambitious students. And what US city has a stronger claim? New York? A fair number of smart people, but diluted by a much larger number of neanderthals in suits. The Bay Area has a lot of smart people too, but again, diluted; there are two great universities, but they're far apart. Harvard and MIT are practically adjacent by West Coast standards, and they're surrounded by about 20 other colleges and universities. [1] Cambridge as a result feels like a town whose main industry is ideas, while New York's is finance and Silicon Valley's is startups. _____ When you talk about cities in the sense we are, what you're really talking about is collections of people. For a long time cities were the only large collections of people, so you could use the two ideas interchangeably. But we can see how much things are changing from the examples I've mentioned. New York is a classic great city. But Cambridge is just part of a city, and Silicon Valley is not even that. (San Jose is not, as it sometimes claims, the capital of Silicon Valley. It's just 178 square miles at one end of it.) Maybe the Internet will change things further. Maybe one day the most important community you belong to will be a virtual one, and it won't matter where you live physically. But I wouldn't bet on it. The physical world is very high bandwidth, and some of the ways cities send you messages are quite subtle. One of the exhilarating things about coming back to Cambridge every spring is walking through the streets at dusk, when you can see into the houses. When you walk through Palo Alto in the evening, you see nothing but the blue glow of TVs. In Cambridge you see shelves full of promising-looking books. Palo Alto was probably much like Cambridge in 1960, but you'd never guess now that there was a university nearby. Now it's just one of the richer neighborhoods in Silicon Valley.","It's very nice, but it's also very
comfortable. So it's not really a place to push yourself. I'm
not saying that the message is wrong. I'm just saying that it's not
the message I wanted. I'm not sure I even want a city that tells me I should
live better. I'm not sure I even want a city that tells me I should be
richer or smarter. I'm not sure I want a city that tells me I should be
more powerful. I'm not sure I want a city that tells me I'm not
enough. I'm not sure I want a city that tells me I'm not

Paul Graham,Ramen Profitable.txt,"Want to start a startup? Get funded by
Y Combinator. July 2009
Now that the term ""ramen profitable"" has become widespread, I ought
to explain precisely what the idea entails. Ramen profitable means a startup makes just enough to pay the
founders' living expenses. This is a different form of profitability
than startups have traditionally aimed for. Traditional profitability
means a big bet is finally paying off, whereas the main importance
of ramen profitability is that it buys you time. [1]
In the past, a startup would usually become profitable only
after raising and spending quite a lot of money. A company making
computer hardware might not become profitable for 5 years, during
which they spent $50 million. But when they did
they might have revenues of $50 million a year. This kind of
profitability means the startup has succeeded. Ramen profitability is the other extreme: a startup that becomes
profitable after 2 months, even though its revenues are only $3000
a month, because the only employees are a couple 25 year old founders
who can live on practically nothing. Revenues of $3000 a month do
not mean the company has succeeded. But it does share something with the one
that's profitable in the traditional way: they don't need to raise
money to survive. Ramen profitability is an unfamiliar idea to most people because
it only recently became feasible. It's still not feasible for a
lot of startups; it would not be for most biotech startups, for
example; but it is for many software startups because they're now
so cheap. For many, the only real cost is the founders'
living expenses. The main significance of this type of profitability is that you're
no longer at the mercy of investors. If you're still losing money,
then eventually you'll either have to raise more
or shut down. Once you're
ramen profitable this painful choice goes away. You can still raise money, but you don't have to do it now. * * *
The most obvious advantage of not needing money is that
you can get better terms. If investors know you need money, they'll
sometimes take advantage of you. Some may even deliberately
stall, because they know that as you run out of money you'll become
increasingly pliable. But there are also three less obvious advantages of ramen profitability. One is that it makes you more attractive to investors. If you're
already profitable, on however small a scale, it shows that (a) you
can get at least someone to pay you, (b) you're serious about
building things people want, and (c) you're disciplined enough to
keep expenses low. This is reassuring to investors, because you've addressed three of
their biggest worries. It's common for them to fund companies that
have smart founders and a big market, and yet still fail. When
these companies fail, it's usually because (a) people wouldn't pay
for what they made, e.g.","because it was too hard to sell to them, or the market wasn't ready yet, (b) the founders solved the wrong problem, instead of paying attention to what users needed, or (c) the company spent too much and burned through their funding before they started to make money. If you're ramen profitable, you're already avoiding these mistakes. Another advantage of ramen profitability is that it's good for morale. A company tends to feel rather theoretical when you first start it. It's legally a company, but you feel like you're lying when you call it one. When people start to pay you significant amounts, the company starts to feel real. And your own living expenses are the milestone you feel most, because at that point the future flips state. Now survival is the default, instead of dying. A morale boost on that scale is very valuable in a startup, because the moral weight of running a startup is what makes it hard. Startups are still very rare. Why don't more people do it? The financial risk? Plenty of 25 year olds save nothing anyway. The long hours? Plenty of people work just as long hours in regular jobs. What keeps people from starting startups is the fear of having so much responsibility. And this is not an irrational fear: it really is hard to bear. Anything that takes some of that weight off you will greatly increase your chances of surviving. A startup that reaches ramen profitability may be more likely to succeed than not. Which is pretty exciting, considering the bimodal distribution of outcomes in startups: you either fail or make a lot of money. The fourth advantage of ramen profitability is the least obvious but may be the most important. If you don't need to raise money, you don't have to interrupt working on the company to do it. Raising money is terribly distracting. You're lucky if your productivity is a third of what it was before. And it can last for months. I didn't understand (or rather, remember) precisely why raising money was so distracting till earlier this year. I'd noticed that startups we funded would usually grind to a halt when they switched to raising money, but I didn't remember exactly why till YC raised money itself. We had a comparatively easy time of it; the first people I asked said yes; but it took months to work out the details, and during that time I got hardly any real work done. Why? Because I thought about it all the time. At any given time there tends to be one problem that's the most urgent for a startup. This is what you think about as you fall asleep at night and when you take a shower in the morning. And when you start raising money, that becomes the problem you think about. You only take one shower in the morning, and if you're thinking about investors during it, then you're not thinking about the product. Whereas if","a product that's not useful, (b) they couldn't
scale up, and (c) they couldn't control costs. So if you've already addressed two of these problems and are
on the way to solving the third, you're in a much better
position. The second less obvious advantage is that it makes you more
attractive to customers. If you're already profitable, you're more
likely to be willing to invest in your product. You can afford to
experiment, you can afford to improve, and you can afford to
take risks. This is a huge advantage. The third less obvious advantage is that it makes you more
attractive to potential employees. If you're already profitable, you can afford to give
better salaries and benefits. You can also afford to offer stock options
and give a better work environment. So being ramen profitable is a big deal, but it's not
the only thing that matters. The main goal of a startup is still to build a product that people
want. You can be ramen profitable but not have a product people
want. So the key is to find the right product, and to build it
well. But if you can get ramen profitable early, that's a huge
advantage. [1] This is a quote from a 2011 blog post by Sam Altman, who was the

if they were in college, and that's what I'm going to tell you. Startups are very counterintuitive. I'm not sure why. Maybe it's
just because knowledge about them hasn't permeated our culture yet. But whatever the reason, starting a startup is a task where you
can't always trust your instincts. It's like skiing in that way. When you first try skiing and you
want to slow down, your instinct is to lean back. But if you lean
back on skis you fly down the hill out of control. So part of
learning to ski is learning to suppress that impulse. Eventually
you get new habits, but at first it takes a conscious effort. At
first there's a list of things you're trying to remember as you
start down the hill. Startups are as unnatural as skiing, so there's a similar list for
startups. Here I'm going to give you the first part of it — the things
to remember if you want to prepare yourself to start a startup. Counterintuitive
The first item on it is the fact I already mentioned: that startups
are so weird that if you trust your instincts, you'll make a lot
of mistakes. If you know nothing more than this, you may at least
pause before making them. When I was running Y Combinator I used to joke that our function
was to tell founders things they would ignore. It's really true. Batch after batch, the YC partners warn founders about mistakes
they're about to make, and the founders ignore them, and then come
back a year later and say ""I wish we'd listened.""
Why do the founders ignore the partners' advice? Well, that's the
thing about counterintuitive ideas: they contradict your intuitions. They seem wrong. So of course your first impulse is to disregard
them. And in fact my joking description is not merely the curse
of Y Combinator but part of its raison d'etre. If founders' instincts
already gave them the right answers, they wouldn't need us. You
only need other people to give you advice that surprises you. That's
why there are a lot of ski instructors and not many running
instructors. [1]
You can, however, trust your instincts about people. And in fact
one of the most common mistakes young founders make is not to
do that enough. They get involved with people who seem impressive,
but about whom they feel some misgivings personally.","Later when things blow up they say ""I knew there was something off about him, but I ignored it because he seemed so impressive."" If you're thinking about getting involved with someone — as a cofounder, an employee, an investor, or an acquirer — and you have misgivings about them, trust your gut. If someone seems slippery, or bogus, or a jerk, don't ignore it. This is one case where it pays to be self-indulgent. Work with people you genuinely like, and you've known long enough to be sure. Expertise The second counterintuitive point is that it's not that important to know a lot about startups. The way to succeed in a startup is not to be an expert on startups, but to be an expert on your users and the problem you're solving for them. Mark Zuckerberg didn't succeed because he was an expert on startups. He succeeded despite being a complete noob at startups, because he understood his users really well. If you don't know anything about, say, how to raise an angel round, don't feel bad on that account. That sort of thing you can learn when you need to, and forget after you've done it. In fact, I worry it's not merely unnecessary to learn in great detail about the mechanics of startups, but possibly somewhat dangerous. If I met an undergrad who knew all about convertible notes and employee agreements and (God forbid) class FF stock, I wouldn't think ""here is someone who is way ahead of their peers."" It would set off alarms. Because another of the characteristic mistakes of young founders is to go through the motions of starting a startup. They make up some plausible-sounding idea, raise money at a good valuation, rent a cool office, hire a bunch of people. From the outside that seems like what startups do. But the next step after rent a cool office and hire a bunch of people is: gradually realize how completely fucked they are, because while imitating all the outward forms of a startup they have neglected the one thing that's actually essential: making something people want. Game We saw this happen so often that we made up a name for it: playing house. Eventually I realized why it was happening. The reason young founders go through the motions of starting a startup is because that's what they've been trained to do for their whole lives up to that point. Think about what you have to do to get into college, for example. Extracurricular activities, check. Even in college classes most of the work is as artificial as running laps. I'm not attacking the educational system for being this way. There will always be a certain amount of fakeness in the work you do when you're being taught something, and if you measure their performance it's inevitable that people will exploit the difference to the point where much of what you're measuring is artifacts of the fakeness. I confess I did it myself","And yet they ignore those misgivings and go ahead. So here's a point to remember: don't ignore your instincts
about people. That's not just a tip for startups — that's a tip for
life. If you're ever in a situation where you feel some kind of
misgivings, even a little, you should ask yourself: ""Is there
something I'm not seeing here?"" If you're in a relationship
and you feel something's off, even a little, you should ask
yourself that question. If you're in a business deal and you feel something's off, you should
ask yourself that question. So the first point is: don't ignore your instincts about people.
Second, don't assume that the most successful people in your
life are the best people to follow. This is another counterintuitive
point. The most successful people in your life are not necessarily
the best people to follow. The most successful people may be the
ones who have the most influence in your life, but they may not
be the ones who have the most wisdom. So, for example, the
most successful person in your life might be someone who has a
lot of money, or who has a lot of power, or who has a lot of
connections. But they may not be the best people to follow. They
may be the ones who have the most influence but not the most
wisdom. So, if you're in a startup, and you're trying to decide
who to follow, you should look for people who have the most
wisdom, not the most influence. That's a big difference. So here's a second point: don't assume that the most successful
people in your life are the best people to follow.
Third, don't assume that the most successful companies are the
ones that are best to imitate. That's another counterintuitive
point. So",487,500,305,0.2273,0.1245,0.9731,0.9318,0.7788,0.9252,4.244,1.2088,0.3963,0.3293,0.0498,0.0512,0.0032,0.0068,0.5243,0.3363,0.9851,0.9626,0.4527972027972028,0.4688581314878893,0.5095890410958904,9,5,0.9695,0.9808,0.17659137577002054,0.16,0.19672131147540983,0.8832,0.6272,29-05-2025

Y Combinator. July 2004
(This essay is derived from a talk at Oscon 2004.)
A few months ago I finished a new
book,
and in reviews I keep
noticing words like ""provocative'' and ""controversial.'' To say
nothing of ""idiotic.''
I didn't mean to make the book controversial. I was trying to make
it efficient. I didn't want to waste people's time telling them
things they already knew. It's more efficient just to give them
the diffs. But I suppose that's bound to yield an alarming book. Edisons
There's no controversy about which idea is most controversial:
the suggestion that variation in wealth might not be as big a
problem as we think. I didn't say in the book that variation in wealth was in itself a
good thing. I said in some situations it might be a sign of good
things. A throbbing headache is not a good thing, but it can be
a sign of a good thing-- for example, that you're recovering
consciousness after being hit on the head. Variation in wealth can be a sign of variation in productivity. (In a society of one, they're identical.) And that
is almost certainly a good thing: if your society has no variation
in productivity, it's probably not because everyone is Thomas
Edison. It's probably because you have no Thomas Edisons. In a low-tech society you don't see much variation in productivity. If you have a tribe of nomads collecting sticks for a fire, how
much more productive is the best stick gatherer going to be than
the worst? A factor of two? Whereas when you hand people a complex tool
like a computer, the variation in what they can do with
it is enormous. That's not a new idea. Fred Brooks wrote about it in 1974, and
the study he quoted was published in 1968. But I think he
underestimated the variation between programmers. He wrote about productivity in lines
of code: the best programmers can solve a given problem in a tenth
the time. But what if the problem isn't given? In programming, as
in many fields, the hard part isn't solving problems, but deciding
what problems to solve. Imagination is hard to measure, but
in practice it dominates the kind of productivity that's measured
in lines of code. Productivity varies in any field, but there are few in which it
varies so much. The variation between programmers
is so great that it becomes a difference in kind. I don't
think this is something intrinsic to programming, though. In every field,
technology magnifies differences in productivity. I think what's
happening in programming is just that we have a lot of technological
leverage. But in every field the lever is getting longer, so the
variation we see is something that more and more fields will see
as time goes on. And the success of companies, and countries, will
depend increasingly on how they deal with it.","If variation in productivity increases with technology, then the contribution of the most productive individuals will not only be disproportionately large, but will actually grow with time. When you reach the point where 90% of a group's output is created by 1% of its members, you lose big if something (whether Viking raids, or central planning) drags their productivity down to the average. If we want to get the most out of them, we need to understand these especially productive people. What motivates them? What do they need to do their jobs? How do you recognize them? How do you get them to come and work for you? And then of course there's the question, how do you become one? More than Money I know a handful of super-hackers, so I sat down and thought about what they have in common. Their defining quality is probably that they really love to program. Ordinary programmers write code to pay the bills. Great hackers think of it as something they do for fun, and which they're delighted to find people will pay them for. Great programmers are sometimes said to be indifferent to money. This isn't quite true. It is true that all they really care about is doing interesting work. But if you make enough money, you get to work on whatever you want, and for that reason hackers are attracted by the idea of making really large amounts of money. But as long as they still have to show up for work every day, they care more about what they do there than how much they get paid for it. Economically, this is a fact of the greatest importance, because it means you don't have to pay great hackers anything like what they're worth. A great programmer might be ten or a hundred times as productive as an ordinary one, but he'll consider himself lucky to get paid three times as much. As I'll explain later, this is partly because great hackers don't know how good they are. But it's also because money is not the main thing they want. What do hackers want? Like all craftsmen, hackers like good tools. In fact, that's an understatement. Good hackers find it unbearable to use bad tools. They'll simply refuse to work on projects with the wrong infrastructure. At a startup I once worked for, one of the things pinned up on our bulletin board was an ad from IBM. It was a picture of an AS400, and the headline read, I think, ""hackers despise it.'' [1] When you decide what infrastructure to use for a project, you're not just making a technical decision. You're also making a social decision, and this may be the more important of the two. For example, if your company wants to write some software, it might seem a prudent choice to write it in Java. But when you choose a language, you're also choosing a community. The programmers you'll be able to hire to work on","Now, this is not to say that we should not have any
variation in wealth. In fact, we should have a lot of it, but we should
not have too much. If we have too much, we get inequality. And inequality is a problem. But the question is, when does inequality become a problem? In a society of one, it's a problem, because the society has no
variation in wealth. In a society of two, it's not a problem, because the
variation is so small. In a society of a million, it's a problem, because the
variation is so large. So, what's the right amount of variation? It's not that we should have a fixed amount, but that we should
have an amount that's proportional to the size of the society. The problem is that in many places, we have a fixed amount of
variation, and that's not right. So, the conclusion is that we should have a lot of variation
in wealth, but not too much. If you have too much, it's a problem. The question is, how to measure it? If you have a society of a million people, and you have a
variation in wealth of a factor of ten, that's not a problem. But if you have a variation of a factor of a thousand, that's a
problem. So, the answer is, we should have a variation in wealth that is
proportional to the size of the society. So, the question is, how to achieve that? How to get the variation that's right for the size of the society? That's the key question. If we can get that, we can have a society that is efficient and
equitable. But the problem is that the way we currently measure inequality
is not appropriate for this. The Gini coefficient is a measure of inequality, but it's
based on the assumption that the distribution is
continuous.",495,500,317,0.1624,0.2915,0.9311,0.9483,0.9113,0.9951,1.3889,0.07,0.4046,0.388,0.0317,0.0846,0.0022,0.0217,0.3475,0.3544,0.9592,0.9693,0.45689655172413796,0.46563573883161513,0.5669291338582677,6,7,0.9622,0.8946,0.18383838383838383,0.164,0.20189274447949526,0.9077,0.5544,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,Apple's Mistake.txt,"Want to start a startup? Get funded by
Y Combinator. November 2009
I don't think Apple realizes how badly the App Store approval process
is broken. Or rather, I don't think they realize how much it matters
that it's broken. The way Apple runs the App Store has harmed their reputation with
programmers more than anything else they've ever done. Their reputation with programmers used to be great. It used to be the most common complaint you heard
about Apple was that their fans admired them too uncritically. The App Store has changed that. Now a lot of programmers
have started to see Apple as evil. How much of the goodwill Apple once had with programmers have they
lost over the App Store? A third? Half? And that's just so far. The App Store is an ongoing karma leak. * * *
How did Apple get into this mess? Their fundamental problem is
that they don't understand software. They treat iPhone apps the way they treat the music they sell through
iTunes. Apple is the channel; they own the user; if you want to
reach users, you do it on their terms. The record labels agreed,
reluctantly. But this model doesn't work for software. It doesn't
work for an intermediary to own the user. The software business
learned that in the early 1980s, when companies like VisiCorp showed
that although the words ""software"" and ""publisher"" fit together,
the underlying concepts don't. Software isn't like music or books. It's too complicated for a third party to act as an intermediary
between developer and user. And yet that's what Apple is trying
to be with the App Store: a software publisher. And a particularly
overreaching one at that, with fussy tastes and a rigidly enforced
house style. If software publishing didn't work in 1980, it works even less now
that software development has evolved from a small number of big
releases to a constant stream of small ones. But Apple doesn't
understand that either. Their model of product development derives
from hardware. They work on something till they think it's finished,
then they release it. You have to do that with hardware, but because
software is so easy to change, its design can benefit from evolution. The standard way to develop applications now is to launch fast and
iterate. Which means it's a disaster to have long, random delays
each time you release a new version. Apparently Apple's attitude is that developers should be more careful
when they submit a new version to the App Store. They would say
that. But powerful as they are, they're not powerful enough to
turn back the evolution of technology. Programmers don't use
launch-fast-and-iterate out of laziness. They use it because it
yields the best results. By obstructing that process, Apple is
making them do bad work, and programmers hate that as much as Apple
would.","How would Apple like it if when they discovered a serious bug in OS X, instead of releasing a software update immediately, they had to submit their code to an intermediary who sat on it for a month and then rejected it because it contained an icon they didn't like? By breaking software development, Apple gets the opposite of what they intended: the version of an app currently available in the App Store tends to be an old and buggy one. One developer told me: As a result of their process, the App Store is full of half-baked applications. I make a new version almost every day that I release to beta users. The version on the App Store feels old and crappy. I'm sure that a lot of developers feel this way: One emotion is ""I'm not really proud about what's in the App Store"", and it's combined with the emotion ""Really, it's Apple's fault."" Another wrote: I believe that they think their approval process helps users by ensuring quality. In reality, bugs like ours get through all the time and then it can take 4-8 weeks to get that bug fix approved, leaving users to think that iPhone apps sometimes just don't work. Worse for Apple, these apps work just fine on other platforms that have immediate approval processes. Actually I suppose Apple has a third misconception: that all the complaints about App Store approvals are not a serious problem. They must hear developers complaining. But partners and suppliers are always complaining. It would be a bad sign if they weren't; it would mean you were being too easy on them. Meanwhile the iPhone is selling better than ever. So why do they need to fix anything? They get away with maltreating developers, in the short term, because they make such great hardware. I just bought a new 27"" iMac a couple days ago. It's fabulous. The screen's too shiny, and the disk is surprisingly loud, but it's so beautiful that you can't make yourself care. So I bought it, but I bought it, for the first time, with misgivings. I felt the way I'd feel buying something made in a country with a bad human rights record. That was new. In the past when I bought things from Apple it was an unalloyed pleasure. Oh boy! They make such great stuff. This time it felt like a Faustian bargain. They make such great stuff, but they're such assholes. Do I really want to support this company? * * * Should Apple care what people like me think? What difference does it make if they alienate a small minority of their users? There are a couple reasons they should care. One is that these users are the people they want as employees. If your company seems evil, the best programmers won't work for you. That hurt Microsoft a lot starting in the 90s. Programmers started to feel sheepish about working there. It seemed like selling out. When people","It's not just that Apple is
obstructing the development process. They're also not giving programmers the tools they need to do their job. The tools they're giving them are not the best tools in the world. For example, the Xcode IDE is a clunky, outdated, and
hard to use piece of software. But what's more, the tools are not even the best in the world, they're
not even the best in the world for the problem they're trying to solve. That is, they're not even the best tools for software development. The App Store is not just a
problem of process. It's a problem of tools. So, to summarize, the App Store is a problem
of process and of tools. The process is broken because Apple doesn't understand software
development. The tools are broken because Apple is not
giving the best tools for software development. That's why the App Store is a bad place to be. It's not that Apple is evil. It's that they're not smart enough to understand the software
business. And that's why, even though they're powerful, they're
losing ground to companies like Google, which understand the software
business better. So, the App Store is a failure of
understanding. It's not a failure of intention. It's a failure of insight. * * * 
But wait, what if Apple's
model is not broken? What if they are not wrong, but just
not trying hard enough? Maybe they are just not smart enough. Maybe they're not trying to be as smart as they can. Maybe they're not trying to understand the software
business. Maybe they're not trying to understand how to build a software
company. Maybe they're not trying to understand how to build a platform. But that's not the case. They're trying to do it. But they're not doing it right.

Paul Graham,How to Get Startup Ideas.txt,"Want to start a startup? Get funded by
Y Combinator. November 2012
The way to get startup ideas is not to try to think of startup
ideas. It's to look for problems, preferably problems you have
yourself. The very best startup ideas tend to have three things in common:
they're something the founders themselves want, that they themselves
can build, and that few others realize are worth doing. Microsoft,
Apple, Yahoo, Google, and Facebook all began this way. Problems
Why is it so important to work on a problem you have? Among other
things, it ensures the problem really exists. It sounds obvious
to say you should only work on problems that exist. And yet by far
the most common mistake startups make is to solve problems no one
has. I made it myself. In 1995 I started a company to put art galleries
online. But galleries didn't want to be online. It's not how the
art business works. So why did I spend 6 months working on this
stupid idea? Because I didn't pay attention to users. I invented
a model of the world that didn't correspond to reality, and worked
from that. I didn't notice my model was wrong until I tried
to convince users to pay for what we'd built. Even then I took
embarrassingly long to catch on. I was attached to my model of the
world, and I'd spent a lot of time on the software. They had to
want it! Why do so many founders build things no one wants? Because they
begin by trying to think of startup ideas. That m.o. is doubly
dangerous: it doesn't merely yield few good ideas; it yields bad
ideas that sound plausible enough to fool you into working on them. At YC we call these ""made-up"" or ""sitcom"" startup ideas. Imagine
one of the characters on a TV show was starting a startup. The
writers would have to invent something for it to do. But coming
up with good startup ideas is hard. It's not something you can do
for the asking. So (unless they got amazingly lucky) the writers
would come up with an idea that sounded plausible, but was actually
bad. For example, a social network for pet owners. It doesn't sound
obviously mistaken. Millions of people have pets. Often they care
a lot about their pets and spend a lot of money on them. Surely
many of these people would like a site where they could talk to
other pet owners. Not all of them perhaps, but if just 2 or 3
percent were regular visitors, you could have millions of users. You could serve them targeted offers, and maybe charge for premium
features.","[1] The danger of an idea like this is that when you run it by your friends with pets, they don't say ""I would never use this."" They say ""Yeah, maybe I could see using something like that."" Even when the startup launches, it will sound plausible to a lot of people. They don't want to use it themselves, at least not right now, but they could imagine other people wanting it. Sum that reaction across the entire population, and you have zero users. [2] Well When a startup launches, there have to be at least some users who really need what they're making — not just people who could see themselves using it one day, but who want it urgently. Usually this initial group of users is small, for the simple reason that if there were something that large numbers of people urgently needed and that could be built with the amount of effort a startup usually puts into a version one, it would probably already exist. Which means you have to compromise on one dimension: you can either build something a large number of people want a small amount, or something a small number of people want a large amount. Choose the latter. Not all ideas of that type are good startup ideas, but nearly all good startup ideas are of that type. Imagine a graph whose x axis represents all the people who might want what you're making and whose y axis represents how much they want it. If you invert the scale on the y axis, you can envision companies as holes. Google is an immense crater: hundreds of millions of people use it, and they need it a lot. A startup just starting out can't expect to excavate that much volume. So you have two choices about the shape of hole you start with. You can either dig a hole that's broad but shallow, or one that's narrow and deep, like a well. Made-up startup ideas are usually of the first type. Lots of people are mildly interested in a social network for pet owners. Nearly all good startup ideas are of the second type. Microsoft was a well when they made Altair Basic. There were only a couple thousand Altair owners, but without this software they were programming in machine language. Thirty years later Facebook had the same shape. Their first site was exclusively for Harvard students, of which there are only a few thousand, but those few thousand users wanted it a lot. When you have an idea for a startup, ask yourself: who wants this right now? Who wants this so much that they'll use it even when it's a crappy version one made by a two-person startup they've never heard of? If you can't answer that, the idea is probably bad. [3] You don't need the narrowness of the well per se. It's depth you need; you get narrowness as a byproduct of optimizing for depth (and speed). But you almost","But what is the real problem here? The problem is that
pet owners don't have a place to talk to other pet owners. But
that's not a real problem. Pet owners already have a place to
talk to other pet owners: the pet store, the vet, the park, the
dog walking service, the pet grooming salon, the online forums
like petco.com, petco. or petco. There are already a lot of
places where pet owners talk to each other. So even if you could
build a better one, it's not a problem that needs solving. The
same is true for many other ""plausible"" startup ideas. The
problem is not that the idea sounds good. It's that the idea is
not actually a problem that people have. So the key is to find
real problems. The best way to find real problems is to look
for problems you have. That's why the first step in the YC
process is to ask founders to tell us what problem they're
trying to solve. It's the most important question we ask. And
that's why we reject a lot of ideas. For example, I've seen
founders come up with ideas that are ""problems"" that are not
real. For instance, ""I'm tired of people not having the
opportunity to be themselves."" But that's not a real problem.
You can't get a problem like that out of your head. You need
to look at the real world and see what is not working. So the
first thing to do is to look around you and see what is broken,
what is not working. What is people doing that you would
like to change? What are they doing that you think is wrong?
The second step is to look at the people who are doing the
things that you think are broken. Because it's not enough to
just know that something is broken.

Does ""Web 2.0"" mean anything? Till recently I thought it didn't,
but the truth turns out to be more complicated. Originally, yes,
it was meaningless. Now it seems to have acquired a meaning. And
yet those who dislike the term are probably right, because if it
means what I think it does, we don't need it. I first heard the phrase ""Web 2.0"" in the name of the Web 2.0
conference in 2004. At the time it was supposed to mean using ""the
web as a platform,"" which I took to refer to web-based applications. [1]
So I was surprised at a conference this summer when Tim O'Reilly
led a session intended to figure out a definition of ""Web 2.0.""
Didn't it already mean using the web as a platform? And if it
didn't already mean something, why did we need the phrase at all? Origins
Tim says the phrase ""Web 2.0"" first
<a href=""http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20
.html"" winautomationvisibilitylandmark=""true"">arose in ""a brainstorming session between
O'Reilly and Medialive International."" What is Medialive International? ""Producers of technology tradeshows and conferences,"" according to
their site. So presumably that's what this brainstorming session
was about. O'Reilly wanted to organize a conference about the web,
and they were wondering what to call it. I don't think there was any deliberate plan to suggest there was a
new version of the web. They just wanted to make the point
that the web mattered again. It was a kind of semantic deficit
spending: they knew new things were coming, and the ""2.0"" referred
to whatever those might turn out to be. And they were right. New things were coming. But the new version
number led to some awkwardness in the short term. In the process
of developing the pitch for the first conference, someone must have
decided they'd better take a stab at explaining what that ""2.0""
referred to. Whatever it meant, ""the web as a platform"" was at
least not too constricting. The story about ""Web 2.0"" meaning the web as a platform didn't live
much past the first conference. By the second conference, what
""Web 2.0"" seemed to mean was something about democracy. At least,
it did when people wrote about it online. The conference itself
didn't seem very grassroots. It cost $2800, so the only people who
could afford to go were VCs and people from big companies. And yet, oddly enough, Ryan Singel's article
about the conference in Wired News spoke of ""throngs of
geeks."" When a friend of mine asked Ryan about this, it was news
to him. He said he'd originally written something like ""throngs
of VCs and biz dev guys"" but had later shortened it just to ""throngs,""
and that this must have in turn been expanded by the editors into
""throngs of geeks."" After all, a Web 2.0 conference would presumably
be full of geeks, right? Well, no. There were about 7.","Even Tim O'Reilly was wearing a suit, a sight so alien I couldn't parse it at first. I saw him walk by and said to one of the O'Reilly people ""that guy looks just like Tim."" ""Oh, that's Tim. He bought a suit."" I ran after him, and sure enough, it was. He explained that he'd just bought it in Thailand. The 2005 Web 2.0 conference reminded me of Internet trade shows during the Bubble, full of prowling VCs looking for the next hot startup. There was that same odd atmosphere created by a large number of people determined not to miss out. Miss out on what? They didn't know. Whatever was going to happen—whatever Web 2.0 turned out to be. I wouldn't quite call it ""Bubble 2.0"" just because VCs are eager to invest again. The Internet is a genuinely big deal. The bust was as much an overreaction as the boom. It's to be expected that once we started to pull out of the bust, there would be a lot of growth in this area, just as there was in the industries that spiked the sharpest before the Depression. The reason this won't turn into a second Bubble is that the IPO market is gone. Venture investors are driven by exit strategies. The reason they were funding all those laughable startups during the late 90s was that they hoped to sell them to gullible retail investors; they hoped to be laughing all the way to the bank. Now that route is closed. Now the default exit strategy is to get bought, and acquirers are less prone to irrational exuberance than IPO investors. The closest you'll get to Bubble valuations is Rupert Murdoch paying $580 million for Myspace. That's only off by a factor of 10 or so. 1. Ajax Does ""Web 2.0"" mean anything more than the name of a conference yet? I don't like to admit it, but it's starting to. When people say ""Web 2.0"" now, I have some idea what they mean. And the fact that I both despise the phrase and understand it is the surest proof that it has started to mean something. One ingredient of its meaning is certainly Ajax, which I can still only just bear to use without scare quotes. Basically, what ""Ajax"" means is ""Javascript now works."" And that in turn means that web-based applications can now be made to work much more like desktop ones. As you read this, a whole new <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB113098635587487074.html?mod=todays_ free_feature"" winautomationvisibilitylandmark=""true"">generation of software is being written to take advantage of Ajax. There hasn't been such a wave of new applications since microcomputers first appeared. Even Microsoft sees it, but it's too late for them to do anything more than leak ""internal"" documents designed to give the impression they're on top of this new trend. In fact the new generation of software is being written way too fast for Microsoft even to channel it, let alone write their own in house. Their only hope","5% geeks, by his estimate. That's not a lot. So, the idea that the Web 2.0 conference was full of geeks
seems to be a misattribution. But then again, if the conference is about the web, maybe
that's what it's supposed to be. But in any case, it seems like a misattribution. But then, I'm not sure that the idea that the Web 2.0 conference
was full of geeks is a misattribution. It's a misattribution in the sense that it's not a direct
inference from the conference's content, but perhaps it's a
misattribution in the sense that it's a misattribution. But maybe that's not the right way to think about it. The key point is that the term ""Web 2.0"" was not intended to
mean the web as a platform. It was intended to mean something else, and that something
else is not clear. But the term Web 2.0 is now used by people in different ways. It's a bit of a
meme, a phrase that's been used in different contexts. And perhaps the real problem is that the term has been
used in different ways. So what is the term Web 2.0 used for? There's the idea that it's about the web as a platform. Then
there's the idea that it's about the web as a democratic space.
There's also the idea that it's about the web as a social space, or
perhaps a social platform. And there's also the idea that it's about the web as a
more mature, more developed version of the web. But these are all different things. The idea that it's about the web as a platform is one thing. The idea that it's about the web as a democratic space is another.
So, the problem is that the term is",493,500,297,0.2463,0.4048,0.9793,0.8928,0.8996,0.9116,1.2203,1.0612,0.3942,0.3752,0.0441,0.1021,0.0059,0.0311,0.5216,0.6324,0.9763,0.9537,0.40625,0.4317032040472175,0.504225352112676,7,5,0.9661,0.808,0.2616632860040568,0.194,0.20875420875420875,0.8716,0.6021,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,Inequality and Risk.txt,"August 2005
(This essay is derived from a talk at Defcon 2005.)
Suppose you wanted to get rid of economic inequality. There are
two ways to do it: give money to the poor, or take it away from the
rich. But they amount to the same thing, because if you want to
give money to the poor, you have to get it from somewhere. You
can't get it from the poor, or they just end up where they started. You have to get it from the rich. There is of course a way to make the poor richer without simply
shifting money from the rich. You could help the poor become more
productive — for example, by improving access to education. Instead
of taking money from engineers and giving it to checkout clerks,
you could enable people who would have become checkout clerks to
become engineers. This is an excellent strategy for making the poor richer. But the
evidence of the last 200 years shows that it doesn't reduce economic
inequality, because it makes the rich richer too. If there
are more engineers, then there are more opportunities to hire them
and to sell them things. Henry Ford couldn't have made a fortune
building cars in a society in which most people were still subsistence
farmers; he would have had neither workers nor customers. If you want to reduce economic inequality instead of just improving
the overall standard of living, it's not enough just to raise up
the poor. What if one of your newly minted engineers gets ambitious
and goes on to become another Bill Gates? Economic inequality will
be as bad as ever. If you actually want to compress the gap between
rich and poor, you have to push down on the top as well as pushing
up on the bottom. How do you push down on the top? You could try to decrease the
productivity of the people who make the most money: make the best
surgeons operate with their left hands, force popular actors to
overeat, and so on. But this approach is hard to implement. The
only practical solution is to let people do the best work they can,
and then (either by taxation or by limiting what they can charge)
to confiscate whatever you deem to be surplus. So let's be clear what reducing economic inequality means. It is
identical with taking money from the rich. When you transform a mathematical expression into another form, you
often notice new things. So it is in this case. Taking money from
the rich turns out to have consequences one might not foresee when
one phrases the same idea in terms of ""reducing inequality.""
The problem is, risk and reward have to be proportionate. A bet
with only a 10% chance of winning has to pay more than one with a
50% chance of winning, or no one will take it.","So if you lop off the top of the possible rewards, you thereby decrease people's willingness to take risks. Transposing into our original expression, we get: decreasing economic inequality means decreasing the risk people are willing to take. There are whole classes of risks that are no longer worth taking if the maximum return is decreased. One reason high tax rates are disastrous is that this class of risks includes starting new companies. Investors Startups are intrinsically risky. A startup is like a small boat in the open sea. One big wave and you're sunk. A competing product, a downturn in the economy, a delay in getting funding or regulatory approval, a patent suit, changing technical standards, the departure of a key employee, the loss of a big account — any one of these can destroy you overnight. It seems only about 1 in 10 startups succeeds. [1] Our startup paid its first round of outside investors 36x. Which meant, with current US tax rates, that it made sense to invest in us if we had better than a 1 in 24 chance of succeeding. That sounds about right. That's probably roughly how we looked when we were a couple of nerds with no business experience operating out of an apartment. If that kind of risk doesn't pay, venture investing, as we know it, doesn't happen. That might be ok if there were other sources of capital for new companies. Why not just have the government, or some large almost-government organization like Fannie Mae, do the venture investing instead of private funds? I'll tell you why that wouldn't work. Because then you're asking government or almost-government employees to do the one thing they are least able to do: take risks. As anyone who has worked for the government knows, the important thing is not to make the right choices, but to make choices that can be justified later if they fail. If there is a safe option, that's the one a bureaucrat will choose. But that is exactly the wrong way to do venture investing. The nature of the business means that you want to make terribly risky choices, if the upside looks good enough. VCs are currently paid in a way that makes them focus on the upside: they get a percentage of the fund's gains. And that helps overcome their understandable fear of investing in a company run by nerds who look like (and perhaps are) college students. If VCs weren't allowed to get rich, they'd behave like bureaucrats. Without hope of gain, they'd have only fear of loss. And so they'd make the wrong choices. They'd turn down the nerds in favor of the smooth-talking MBA in a suit, because that investment would be easier to justify later if it failed. Founders But even if you could somehow redesign venture funding to work without allowing VCs to become rich, there's another kind of investor you simply cannot replace: the startups' founders and early employees. What they invest","So if the rich
have a higher chance of being the winners of the economic game,
then they should get a higher reward. But the problem is that in reality, the rich have a much
higher chance of being winners, and yet they get a lower
reward. So that is a problem. So the problem is not that the rich are getting too much
money, but that they are getting too little. The rich have a higher chance of being winners, but they get
less reward than the average person. That is the real problem. So what is the solution? The solution is to give the rich a higher reward, not a
lower one. That is, we should make the rich pay more taxes, or
otherwise be forced to give more money to the public. That is the way to
reduce inequality. That is the way to make the rich pay their fair share.
So, the conclusion is that, to reduce economic inequality, we
have to take money from the rich. But we also have to take money from the
rich in a way that's fair. That is, we have to take from them in a way that is
proportionate to the risk they take. So if the rich have a higher risk of being winners, they should
get a higher reward. Therefore, the solution is to tax the rich more. So this is a very strange idea. I mean, in the US, for example, the top income tax rate was
70% for a long time. Then it was lowered, and that was a bad
idea. It was lowered to 35% in the 1980s. Then it was lowered again
to 30% in the 1990s, and then to 28% in 2003. Then, in 2004, it was
lowered again to 25%. So that is a trend of lowering",484,500,306,0.168,0.2938,0.9755,0.9235,0.9907,0.7659,-0.1619,-4.0807,0.3643,0.3762,0.0512,0.0826,0.0038,0.0244,0.3934,0.6204,0.9601,0.9584,0.4632352941176471,0.4031141868512111,0.519774011299435,5,6,0.9458,0.958,0.11983471074380166,0.16,0.1437908496732026,0.8119,0.6344,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,Six Principles for Making New Things.txt,"February 2008
The fiery reaction to the release of Arc had
an unexpected consequence: it made me realize I had a design
philosophy. The main complaint of the more articulate critics was
that Arc seemed so flimsy. After years of working on it, all I had
to show for myself were a few thousand lines of macros? Why hadn't
I worked on more substantial problems? As I was mulling over these remarks it struck me how familiar they
seemed. This was exactly the kind of thing people said at first
about Viaweb, and Y Combinator, and most of my essays. When we launched Viaweb, it seemed laughable to VCs and e-commerce
""experts."" We were just a couple guys in an apartment,
which did not seem cool in 1995 the way it does now. And the thing
we'd built, as far as they could tell, wasn't even software. Software, to them, equalled big, honking Windows apps. Since Viaweb
was the first web-based app
they'd seen, it seemed to be nothing
more than a website. They were even more contemptuous when they
discovered that Viaweb didn't process credit card transactions (we
didn't for the whole first year). Transaction processing seemed
to them what e-commerce was all about. It sounded serious and
difficult. And yet, mysteriously, Viaweb ended up crushing all its competitors. The initial reaction to
Y Combinator was almost identical. It
seemed laughably lightweight. Startup funding meant series A rounds:
millions of dollars given to a small number of startups founded by
people with established credentials after months of serious,
businesslike meetings, on terms described in a document a foot
thick. Y Combinator seemed inconsequential. It's too early to say
yet whether Y Combinator will turn out like Viaweb, but judging
from the number of imitations, a lot of people seem to think we're
on to something. I can't measure whether my essays are successful, except in page
views, but the reaction to them is at least different from when I
started. At first the default reaction of the Slashdot trolls was
(translated into articulate terms): ""Who is this guy and what
authority does he have to write about these topics? I haven't read
the essay, but there's no way anything so short and written in such
an informal style could have anything useful to say about such and
such topic, when people with degrees in the subject have already
written many thick books about it."" Now there's a new generation
of trolls on a new generation of sites, but they have at least
started to omit the initial ""Who is this guy?""
Now people are saying the same things about Arc that they said at
first about Viaweb and Y Combinator and most of my essays. Why the
pattern? The answer, I realized, is that my m.o. for all four has
been the same.","Here it is: I like to find (a) simple solutions (b) to overlooked problems (c) that actually need to be solved, and (d) deliver them as informally as possible, (e) starting with a very crude version 1, then (f) iterating rapidly. When I first laid out these principles explicitly, I noticed something striking: this is practically a recipe for generating a contemptuous initial reaction. Though simple solutions are better, they don't seem as impressive as complex ones. Overlooked problems are by definition problems that most people think don't matter. Delivering solutions in an informal way means that instead of judging something by the way it's presented, people have to actually understand it, which is more work. And starting with a crude version 1 means your initial effort is always small and incomplete. I'd noticed, of course, that people never seemed to grasp new ideas at first. I thought it was just because most people were stupid. Now I see there's more to it than that. Like a contrarian investment fund, someone following this strategy will almost always be doing things that seem wrong to the average person. As with contrarian investment strategies, that's exactly the point. This technique is successful (in the long term) because it gives you all the advantages other people forgo by trying to seem legit. If you work on overlooked problems, you're more likely to discover new things, because you have less competition. If you deliver solutions informally, you (a) save all the effort you would have had to expend to make them look impressive, and (b) avoid the danger of fooling yourself as well as your audience. And if you release a crude version 1 then iterate, your solution can benefit from the imagination of nature, which, as Feynman pointed out, is more powerful than your own. In the case of Viaweb, the simple solution was to make the software run on the server. The overlooked problem was to generate web sites automatically; in 1995, online stores were all made by hand by human designers, but we knew this wouldn't scale. The part that actually mattered was graphic design, not transaction processing. The informal delivery mechanism was me, showing up in jeans and a t-shirt at some retailer's office. And the crude version 1 was, if I remember correctly, less than 10,000 lines of code when we launched. The power of this technique extends beyond startups and programming languages and essays. It probably extends to any kind of creative work. Certainly it can be used in painting: this is exactly what Cezanne and Klee did. At Y Combinator we bet money on it, in the sense that we encourage the startups we fund to work this way. There are always new ideas right under your nose. So look for simple things that other people have overlooked—things people will later claim were ""obvious""—especially when they've been led astray by obsolete conventions, or by trying to do things that are superficially impressive. Figure out what the real","I've been building things that are small and
simple, not for the sake of being small and simple, but
because they are the only way to build something that can be
used and iterated on. I've been making things that are lightweight, not for the
sake of being lightweight, but because they are the only way to
build something that can be used and iterated on. I've been building things that are flimsy, not for the sake of being flimsy, but
because they are the only way to build something that can be used
and iterated on. I've been making things that are ""flimsy"" because they are the only way to
build something that can be used and iterated on. So, the key idea here is that the way you build a thing is the
same as the way you build a system. So, for example, if you want to build a website, you don't
build it as a monolithic application. You build it as a system of small, simple, interconnected
parts. If you want to build a startup, you don't build it as a
monolithic company. You build it as a system of small, simple, interconnected
parts. If you want to build a theory, you don't build it as a big
monolithic theory. You build it as a system of small, simple, interconnected
parts. If you want to build a website, you don't build it as a
monolithic application. You build it as a system of small, simple, interconnected
parts. The key idea is that the way you build a thing is the same as the way you build a system. So, in short, I'm not trying to build something that is
flimsy. I'm trying to build something that is usable and
iterable. I'm trying to build something that is small and simple.

Paul Graham,Where to See Silicon Valley.txt,"Want to start a startup? Get funded by
Y Combinator. October 2010
Silicon Valley proper is mostly suburban sprawl. At first glance
it doesn't seem there's anything to see. It's not the sort of place
that has conspicuous monuments. But if you look, there are subtle
signs you're in a place that's different from other places. 1. Stanford
University
Stanford is a strange place. Structurally it is to an ordinary
university what suburbia is to a city. It's enormously spread out,
and feels surprisingly empty much of the time. But notice the
weather. It's probably perfect. And notice the beautiful mountains
to the west. And though you can't see it, cosmopolitan San Francisco
is 40 minutes to the north. That combination is much of the reason
Silicon Valley grew up around this university and not some other
one. 2. University
Ave
A surprising amount of the work of the Valley is done in the cafes
on or just off University Ave in Palo Alto. If you visit on a
weekday between 10 and 5, you'll often see founders pitching
investors. In case you can't tell, the founders are the ones leaning
forward eagerly, and the investors are the ones sitting back with
slightly pained expressions. 3. The Lucky
Office
The office at 165 University Ave was Google's first. Then it was
Paypal's. (Now it's Wepay's.) The interesting thing about it is
the location. It's a smart move to put a startup in a place with
restaurants and people walking around instead of in an office park,
because then the people who work there want to stay there, instead
of fleeing as soon as conventional working hours end. They go out
for dinner together, talk about ideas, and then come back and
implement them. It's important to realize that Google's current location in an
office park is not where they started; it's just where they were
forced to move when they needed more space. Facebook was till
recently across the street, till they too had to move because they
needed more space. 4. Old
Palo Alto
Palo Alto was not originally a suburb. For the first 100 years or
so of its existence, it was a college town out in the countryside. Then in the mid 1950s it was engulfed in a wave of suburbia that
raced down the peninsula. But Palo Alto north of Oregon expressway
still feels noticeably different from the area around it. It's one
of the nicest places in the Valley. The buildings are old (though
increasingly they are being torn down and replaced with generic
McMansions) and the trees are tall. But houses are very
expensive—around $1000 per square foot. This is post-exit
Silicon Valley. 5. Sand
Hill Road
It's interesting to see the VCs' offices on the north side of Sand
Hill Road precisely because they're so boringly uniform. The
buildings are all more or less the same, their exteriors express
very little, and they are arranged in a confusing maze.","(I've been visiting them for years and I still occasionally get lost.) It's not a coincidence. These buildings are a pretty accurate reflection of the VC business. If you go on a weekday you may see groups of founders there to meet VCs. But mostly you won't see anyone; bustling is the last word you'd use to describe the atmos. Visiting Sand Hill Road reminds you that the opposite of ""down and dirty"" would be ""up and clean."" 6. Castro Street It's a tossup whether Castro Street or University Ave should be considered the heart of the Valley now. University Ave would have been 10 years ago. But Palo Alto is getting expensive. Increasingly startups are located in Mountain View, and Palo Alto is a place they come to meet investors. Palo Alto has a lot of different cafes, but there is one that clearly dominates in Mountain View: Red Rock. 7. Google Google spread out from its first building in Mountain View to a lot of the surrounding ones. But because the buildings were built at different times by different people, the place doesn't have the sterile, walled-off feel that a typical large company's headquarters have. It definitely has a flavor of its own though. You sense there is something afoot. The general atmos is vaguely utopian; there are lots of Priuses, and people who look like they drive them. You can't get into Google unless you know someone there. It's very much worth seeing inside if you can, though. Ditto for Facebook, at the end of California Ave in Palo Alto, though there is nothing to see outside. 8. Skyline Drive Skyline Drive runs along the crest of the Santa Cruz mountains. On one side is the Valley, and on the other is the sea—which because it's cold and foggy and has few harbors, plays surprisingly little role in the lives of people in the Valley, considering how close it is. Along some parts of Skyline the dominant trees are huge redwoods, and in others they're live oaks. Redwoods mean those are the parts where the fog off the coast comes in at night; redwoods condense rain out of fog. The MROSD manages a collection of great walking trails off Skyline. 9. 280 Silicon Valley has two highways running the length of it: 101, which is pretty ugly, and 280, which is one of the more beautiful highways in the world. I always take 280 when I have a choice. Notice the long narrow lake to the west? That's the San Andreas Fault. It runs along the base of the hills, then heads uphill through Portola Valley. One of the MROSD trails runs right along the fault. A string of rich neighborhoods runs along the foothills to the west of 280: Woodside, Portola Valley, Los Altos Hills, Saratoga, Los Gatos. SLAC goes right under 280 a little bit south of Sand Hill Road. And a couple miles south of that is the Valley's equivalent of the ""Welcome to","The
reason is that VCs have to be very efficient and low-profile
because they're in a very competitive industry. But it's also
interesting to note that the entrepreneurs are on the south side,
and they're more interesting and more varied. It's a contrast
that's been going on for decades. 6. The
Valley
The Valley is a place that's not a place. It's a concept. But
when you walk around, you can feel the energy. The people who
live there are not the ones who live in the cities, but the ones
who live in the suburbs. The people who live in the Valley are
the ones who live in the places that are not in the cities. The
people who live in the Valley are the ones who live in the places
that are not in the cities. So the Valley is a place of people
who live in the places that are not in the cities. 7. The
Cafes
The cafes are the heart of the Valley. They are where the
entrepreneurs and investors meet. They are the places where
people meet and talk. They are the places where people come to
work, and where people go to meet and talk. They are the places
where the Valley's magic happens. 8. The

The Valley is a place that's not a place. It's a concept. But

Paul Graham,The Future of Web Startups.txt,"Want to start a startup? Get funded by
Y Combinator. October 2007
(This essay is derived from a keynote at FOWA in October 2007.)
There's something interesting happening right now. Startups are
undergoing the same transformation that technology does when it becomes
cheaper. It's a pattern we see over and over in technology. Initially
there's some device that's very expensive and made
in small quantities. Then someone discovers how to make them cheaply;
many more get built; and as a result they can be used in new ways. Computers are a familiar example. When I was a kid, computers were
big, expensive machines built one at a time. Now they're a commodity. Now we can stick computers in everything. This pattern is very old. Most of the turning
points in economic history are instances of it. It happened to
steel in the 1850s, and to power in the 1780s. It happened to cloth manufacture in the thirteenth century, generating
the wealth that later brought about the Renaissance. Agriculture
itself was an instance of this pattern. Now as well as being produced by startups, this pattern
is happening to startups. It's so cheap to start web startups
that orders of magnitudes more will be started. If the pattern
holds true, that should cause dramatic changes. 1. Lots of Startups
So my first prediction about the future of web startups is pretty
straightforward: there will be a lot of them. When starting a
startup was expensive, you had to get the permission of investors
to do it. Now the only threshold is courage. Even that threshold is getting lower, as people watch others take
the plunge and survive. In the last batch of startups we funded,
we had several founders who said they'd thought of applying before,
but weren't sure and got jobs instead. It was only after hearing
reports of friends who'd done it that they decided to try it
themselves. Starting a startup is hard, but having a 9 to 5 job is hard too,
and in some ways a worse kind of hard. In a startup you have lots
of worries, but you don't have that feeling that your life is flying
by like you do in a big company. Plus in a startup you could make
much more money. As word spreads that startups work, the number may grow
to a point that would now seem surprising. We now think of it as normal to have a job at a company, but this
is the thinnest of historical veneers. Just two or three
lifetimes ago, most people in what are now called industrialized
countries lived by farming. So while it may seem surprising to
propose that large numbers of people will change the way they make
a living, it would be more surprising if they didn't. 2. Standardization
When technology makes something dramatically cheaper, standardization
always follows. When you make things in large volumes you tend
to standardize everything that doesn't need to change.","At Y Combinator we still only have four people, so we try to standardize everything. We could hire employees, but we want to be forced to figure out how to scale investing. We often tell startups to release a minimal version one quickly, then let the needs of the users determine what to do next. In essense, let the market design the product. We've done the same thing ourselves. We think of the techniques we're developing for dealing with large numbers of startups as like software. Sometimes it literally is software, like Hacker News and our application system. One of the most important things we've been working on standardizing are investment terms. Till now investment terms have been individually negotiated. This is a problem for founders, because it makes raising money take longer and cost more in legal fees. So as well as using the same paperwork for every deal we do, we've commissioned generic angel paperwork that all the startups we fund can use for future rounds. Some investors will still want to cook up their own deal terms. Series A rounds, where you raise a million dollars or more, will be custom deals for the forseeable future. But I think angel rounds will start to be done mostly with standardized agreements. An angel who wants to insert a bunch of complicated terms into the agreement is probably not one you want anyway. 3. New Attitude to Acquisition Another thing I see starting to get standardized is acquisitions. As the volume of startups increases, big companies will start to develop standardized procedures that make acquisitions little more work than hiring someone. Google is the leader here, as in so many areas of technology. They buy a lot of startups— more than most people realize, because they only announce a fraction of them. And being Google, they're figuring out how to do it efficiently. One problem they've solved is how to think about acquisitions. For most companies, acquisitions still carry some stigma of inadequacy. Companies do them because they have to, but there's usually some feeling they shouldn't have to—that their own programmers should be able to build everything they need. Google's example should cure the rest of the world of this idea. Google has by far the best programmers of any public technology company. If they don't have a problem doing acquisitions, the others should have even less problem. However many Google does, Microsoft should do ten times as many. One reason Google doesn't have a problem with acquisitions is that they know first-hand the quality of the people they can get that way. Larry and Sergey only started Google after making the rounds of the search engines trying to sell their idea and finding no takers. They've been the guys coming in to visit the big company, so they know who might be sitting across that conference table from them. 4. Riskier Strategies are Possible Risk is always proportionate to reward. The way to get really big returns","In the case of web startups, this is already happening. You can
choose to run your startup on any of several platforms, but the
main one is now a single, standardized platform. The web. The web is an open system. If you look at the web, you can see that it's been standardized in a
way that makes it possible for people to build on it. That's a huge advantage for startups, since it allows them to
focus on what they do best, which is to build something new. Instead of building the whole system, they can build on top of
the existing one. The web allows startups to avoid the problem of building the
entire infrastructure. It also allows them to focus on the product. The web is a platform for startups. That's why we've been so successful in the web startups we've funded. 3. Scale
Once something becomes cheap, it's easy to scale. That's the
second key point. If you can start a startup cheaply, you can make more of them. And once you have a lot of startups, you can scale them. So if you have a successful startup, you can look at what it's doing and
scale it. The web is a great example of this. When the web was created, it was very small and very expensive. But now it's big and cheap. The web is a great example of the pattern. The web was created by a small group of people who had
a vision. Then it became cheap and widespread, and then it became a platform
for more people. This is the same process that happened with the personal computer. The personal computer was created by a small group of people, then
it became cheap, widespread, and then it became a platform for
others. The web is a platform for startups. The web is a platform for the world. 4. Competition
The third key point is that competition is going to be",496,500,329,0.1693,0.2404,0.9735,0.9634,0.9082,0.8489,1.3879,-2.0746,0.374,0.3932,0.0421,0.0408,0.0053,0.0026,0.523,0.6578,0.9686,0.9711,0.4575971731448763,0.43315508021390375,0.49736842105263157,5,7,0.9961,0.9964,0.14516129032258066,0.128,0.16109422492401215,0.8825,0.6901,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,How to Be an Expert in a Changing World.txt,"December 2014
If the world were static, we could have monotonically increasing
confidence in our beliefs. The more (and more varied) experience
a belief survived, the less likely it would be false. Most people
implicitly believe something like this about their opinions. And
they're justified in doing so with opinions about things that don't
change much, like human nature. But you can't trust your opinions
in the same way about things that change, which could include
practically everything else. When experts are wrong, it's often because they're experts on an
earlier version of the world. Is it possible to avoid that? Can you protect yourself against
obsolete beliefs? To some extent, yes. I spent almost a decade
investing in early stage startups, and curiously enough protecting
yourself against obsolete beliefs is exactly what you have to do
to succeed as a startup investor. Most really good startup ideas
look like bad ideas at first, and many of those look bad specifically
because some change in the world just switched them from bad to
good. I spent a lot of time learning to recognize such ideas, and
the techniques I used may be applicable to ideas in general. The first step is to have an explicit belief in change. People who
fall victim to a monotonically increasing confidence in their
opinions are implicitly concluding the world is static. If you
consciously remind yourself it isn't, you start to look for change. Where should one look for it? Beyond the moderately useful
generalization that human nature doesn't change much, the unfortunate
fact is that change is hard to predict. This is largely a tautology
but worth remembering all the same: change that matters usually
comes from an unforeseen quarter. So I don't even try to predict it. When I get asked in interviews
to predict the future, I always have to struggle to come up with
something plausible-sounding on the fly, like a student who hasn't
prepared for an exam. [1]
But it's not out of laziness that I haven't
prepared. It seems to me that beliefs about the future are so
rarely correct that they usually aren't worth the extra rigidity
they impose, and that the best strategy is simply to be aggressively
open-minded. Instead of trying to point yourself in the right
direction, admit you have no idea what the right direction is, and
try instead to be super sensitive to the winds of change. It's ok to have working hypotheses, even though they may constrain
you a bit, because they also motivate you. It's exciting to chase
things and exciting to try to guess answers. But you have to be
disciplined about not letting your hypotheses harden into anything
more. [2]
I believe this passive m.o. works not just for evaluating new ideas
but also for having them. The way to come up with new ideas is not
to try explicitly to, but to try to solve problems and simply not
discount weird hunches you have in the process.","The winds of change originate in the unconscious minds of domain experts. If you're sufficiently expert in a field, any weird idea or apparently irrelevant question that occurs to you is ipso facto worth exploring. [3] Within Y Combinator, when an idea is described as crazy, it's a compliment—in fact, on average probably a higher compliment than when an idea is described as good. Startup investors have extraordinary incentives for correcting obsolete beliefs. If they can realize before other investors that some apparently unpromising startup isn't, they can make a huge amount of money. But the incentives are more than just financial. Investors' opinions are explicitly tested: startups come to them and they have to say yes or no, and then, fairly quickly, they learn whether they guessed right. The investors who say no to a Google (and there were several) will remember it for the rest of their lives. Anyone who must in some sense bet on ideas rather than merely commenting on them has similar incentives. Which means anyone who wants such incentives can have them, by turning their comments into bets: if you write about a topic in some fairly durable and public form, you'll find you worry much more about getting things right than most people would in a casual conversation. [4] Another trick I've found to protect myself against obsolete beliefs is to focus initially on people rather than ideas. Though the nature of future discoveries is hard to predict, I've found I can predict quite well what sort of people will make them. Good new ideas come from earnest, energetic, independent-minded people. Betting on people over ideas saved me countless times as an investor. We thought Airbnb was a bad idea, for example. But we could tell the founders were earnest, energetic, and independent-minded. (Indeed, almost pathologically so.) So we suspended disbelief and funded them. This too seems a technique that should be generally applicable. Surround yourself with the sort of people new ideas come from. If you want to notice quickly when your beliefs become obsolete, you can't do better than to be friends with the people whose discoveries will make them so. It's hard enough already not to become the prisoner of your own expertise, but it will only get harder, because change is accelerating. That's not a recent trend; change has been accelerating since the paleolithic era. Ideas beget ideas. I don't expect that to change. But I could be wrong. Notes [1] My usual trick is to talk about aspects of the present that most people haven't noticed yet. [2] Especially if they become well enough known that people start to identify them with you. You have to be extra skeptical about things you want to believe, and once a hypothesis starts to be identified with you, it will almost certainly start to be in that category. [3] In practice ""sufficiently expert"" doesn't require one to be recognized as an expert—which is a trailing indicator in any case. In many","If you have an idea
that doesn't seem to fit into the current world, that's a good sign.
The world is changing, and your ideas are going to have to change
with it. [3]
So here's the thing: the world is changing, and you have to be
able to adapt. The more you adapt, the more you'll be able to
survive. If you can't adapt, you'll be out. [4]
[1] This is also the reason why people who do a lot of predicting are often
wrong. If you try to make a prediction that is actually not just a
guess, but a prediction about the future, then you have to be
prepared to be wrong. But if you're not prepared to be wrong, you're
not going to be right either.
[2] This is a bit of a paradox. It seems like you can't be open-minded
and still have a working hypothesis. But if you have a working
hypothesis that is not fixed, then you can be open-minded. If you're
not sure what the hypothesis is, you can be open-minded. If you're
not sure what the hypothesis is, and you're not sure what the
evidence is, then you're really open-minded.
[3] This is also the reason why people who are too rigid in their
beliefs are often wrong. If you don't allow for change, you can't
adapt. If you can't adapt, you can't survive.
[4] This is also the reason why people who are too rigid in their
beliefs are often wrong. If you don't allow for change, you can't
adapt. If you can't adapt, you can't survive.

Paul Graham,Succinctness is Power.txt,"May 2002
""The quantity of meaning compressed into a small space by
algebraic signs, is another circumstance that facilitates
the reasonings we are accustomed to carry on by their aid.""
- Charles Babbage, quoted in Iverson's Turing Award Lecture
In the discussion about issues raised by Revenge
of the Nerds on the LL1 mailing list, Paul Prescod wrote
something that stuck in my mind. Python's goal is regularity and readability, not succinctness. On the face of it, this seems a rather damning thing to claim about a
programming language. As far as I can tell, succinctness = power. If so, then substituting, we get
Python's goal is regularity and readability, not power. and this doesn't seem a tradeoff (if it is a tradeoff)
that you'd want to make. It's not far from saying that Python's goal is not to be effective
as a programming language. Does succinctness = power? This seems to me an important question,
maybe the most important question for anyone interested in
language design, and one that it would be useful to confront
directly. I don't feel sure yet that the answer is a simple yes, but it seems
a good hypothesis to begin with. Hypothesis
My hypothesis is that succinctness is power, or is close enough
that except in pathological examples you can treat them as
identical. It seems to me that succinctness is what programming languages are
for. Computers would be just as happy to be told what to
do directly in machine language. I think that the main
reason we take the trouble to develop high-level languages is to
get leverage, so that we can say (and more importantly, think)
in 10 lines of a high-level language what would require 1000
lines of machine language. In other words,
the main point of high-level languages is to make source code smaller. If smaller source code is the purpose of high-level languages, and
the power of something is how well it achieves its purpose, then
the measure of the power of a programming language is how small it
makes your programs. Conversely, a language that doesn't make your programs small is
doing a bad job of what programming languages are supposed to
do, like a knife that doesn't cut well, or printing that's illegible. Metrics
Small in what sense though? The most common measure of code size is
lines of code. But I think that this metric is the most common because
it is the easiest to measure. I don't think anyone really believes
it is the true test of the length of a program. Different
languages have different conventions for how much you should put
on a line; in C a lot of lines have nothing on them but a delimiter or two. Another easy test is the number of characters in a
program, but this is not very good either; some languages (Perl,
for example) just
use shorter identifiers than others.","I think a better measure of the size of a program would be the number of elements, where an element is anything that would be a distinct node if you drew a tree representing the source code. The name of a variable or function is an element; an integer or a floating-point number is an element; a segment of literal text is an element; an element of a pattern, or a format directive, is an element; a new block is an element. There are borderline cases (is -5 two elements or one?) but I think most of them are the same for every language, so they don't affect comparisons much. This metric needs fleshing out, and it could require interpretation in the case of specific languages, but I think it tries to measure the right thing, which is the number of parts a program has. I think the tree you'd draw in this exercise is what you have to make in your head in order to conceive of the program, and so its size is proportionate to the amount of work you have to do to write or read it. Design This kind of metric would allow us to compare different languages, but that is not, at least for me, its main value. The main value of the succinctness test is as a guide in designing languages. The most useful comparison between languages is between two potential variants of the same language. What can I do in the language to make programs shorter? If the conceptual load of a program is proportionate to its complexity, and a given programmer can tolerate a fixed conceptual load, then this is the same as asking, what can I do to enable programmers to get the most done? And that seems to me identical to asking, how can I design a good language? (Incidentally, nothing makes it more patently obvious that the old chestnut ""all languages are equivalent"" is false than designing languages. When you are designing a new language, you're constantly comparing two languages-- the language if I did x, and if I didn't-- to decide which is better. If this were really a meaningless question, you might as well flip a coin.) Aiming for succinctness seems a good way to find new ideas. If you can do something that makes many different programs shorter, it is probably not a coincidence: you have probably discovered a useful new abstraction. You might even be able to write a program to help by searching source code for repeated patterns. Among other languages, those with a reputation for succinctness would be the ones to look to for new ideas: Forth, Joy, Icon. Comparison The first person to write about these issues, as far as I know, was Fred Brooks in the Mythical Man Month. He wrote that programmers seemed to generate about the same amount of code per day regardless of the language. When I first read this in my early twenties, it was a big","The number of operations
needed to compute the result is a better measure, but this is
hard to compute. If we have to choose, I think that the number of operations
needed is the best metric, but I have to admit that I'm not sure. I think that the number of operations is what's important for the
efficiency of the program. But even more important is the number of operations
needed to write the program. That is, how much work do you have to do to write a
program in a given language. If you have to write 100 lines of code, you can be sure
that you have to do a lot of work. If you can write it in 10 lines, you
have done a lot less work. This is the same as the number of operations
needed to write the program. So, the total work is the number of operations in the program plus the number
of operations needed to write the program. But this is getting a bit complicated. Let's just say that the number of operations needed to write the program is a
measure of the ease of writing the program, and that the number of operations in the program is a measure of the efficiency of the program. So, for a language to be powerful, it should be able to make both of these numbers as small as possible. That is, it should be able to make both the code short and the code easy to write. So, what's the most succinct way to write a program in Python? Let's take an example. Here is a Python program that prints the numbers from 1 to 10, each on a separate line. print 1
print 2
print 3
print 4
print 5
print 6
print 7
print 8
print 9
print 10
That's 10 lines of code. But in Python you can do this in a",487,500,321,0.3232,0.1371,0.9769,0.9504,0.9076,0.872,2.1212,-2.6667,0.4289,0.4004,0.0705,0.0838,0.0069,0.0206,0.3997,0.3944,0.9841,0.9805,0.44064748201438847,0.4690265486725664,0.5042016806722689,7,7,0.9561,0.9629,0.15195071868583163,0.138,0.11214953271028037,0.9574,0.6063,29-05-2025
Paul Graham,The Fatal Pinch.txt,"December 2014
Many startups go through a point a few months before they die where
although they have a significant amount of money in the bank, they're
also losing a lot each month, and revenue growth is either nonexistent
or mediocre. The company has, say, 6 months of runway. Or to put
it more brutally, 6 months before they're out of business. They
expect to avoid that by raising more from investors. [1]
That last sentence is the fatal one. There may be nothing founders are so prone to delude themselves
about as how interested investors will be in giving them additional
funding. It's hard to convince investors the first time too, but
founders expect that. What bites them the second time is a confluence
of three forces:
The company is spending more now than it did the first time
it raised money. Investors have much higher standards for companies that have
already raised money. The company is now starting to read as a failure. The first
time it raised money, it was neither a success nor a failure; it
was too early to ask. Now it's possible to ask that question, and
the default answer is failure, because at this point that is the
default outcome. I'm going to call the situation I described in the first paragraph ""the fatal pinch."" I try to resist
coining phrases, but making up a name for this situation may snap
founders into realizing when they're in it. One of the things that makes the fatal pinch so dangerous is
that it's self-reinforcing. Founders overestimate their chances
of raising more money, and so are slack about reaching
profitability, which further decreases their chances of raising
money. Now that you know about the fatal pinch, how do you avoid it? Y Combinator tells
founders who raise money to act as if it's the last they'll ever
get. Because the self-reinforcing nature of this situation works
the other way too: the less you need further investment, the easier
it is to get. What do you do if you're already in the fatal pinch? The
first step is to re-evaluate the probability of raising more money. I will now, by an amazing feat of clairvoyance, do this for you:
the probability is zero. [2]
Three options remain: you can shut down the company, you can increase
how much you make, and you can decrease how much you spend. You should shut down the company if you're certain it will
fail no matter what you do. Then at least you can give back the
money you have left, and save yourself however many months you would
have spent riding it down. Companies rarely have to fail though. What I'm really doing
here is giving you the option of admitting you've already given up. If you don't want to shut down the company, that leaves increasing
revenues and decreasing expenses. In most startups, expenses =
people, and decreasing expenses = firing people.","[3] Deciding to fire people is usually hard, but there's one case in which it shouldn't be: when there are people you already know you should fire but you're in denial about it. If so, now's the time. If that makes you profitable, or will enable you to make it to profitability on the money you have left, you've avoided the immediate danger. Otherwise you have three options: you either have to fire good people, get some or all of the employees to take less salary for a while, or increase revenues. Getting people to take less salary is a weak solution that will only work when the problem isn't too bad. If your current trajectory won't quite get you to profitability but you can get over the threshold by cutting salaries a little, you might be able to make the case to everyone for doing it. Otherwise you're probably just postponing the problem, and that will be obvious to the people whose salaries you're proposing to cut. [4] Which leaves two options, firing good people and making more money. While trying to balance them, keep in mind the eventual goal: to be a successful product company in the sense of having a single thing lots of people use. You should lean more toward firing people if the source of your trouble is overhiring. If you went out and hired 15 people before you even knew what you were building, you've created a broken company. You need to figure out what you're building, and it will probably be easier to do that with a handful of people than 15. Plus those 15 people might not even be the ones you need for whatever you end up building. So the solution may be to shrink and then figure out what direction to grow in. After all, you're not doing those 15 people any favors if you fly the company into ground with them aboard. They'll all lose their jobs eventually, along with all the time they expended on this doomed company. Whereas if you only have a handful of people, it may be better to focus on trying to make more money. It may seem facile to suggest a startup make more money, as if that could be done for the asking. Usually a startup is already trying as hard as it can to sell whatever it sells. What I'm suggesting here is not so much to try harder to make money but to try to make money in a different way. For example, if you have only one person selling while the rest are writing code, consider having everyone work on selling. What good will more code do you when you're out of business? If you have to write code to close a certain deal, go ahead; that follows from everyone working on selling. But only work on whatever will get you the most revenue the soonest. Another way to make money differently is to sell different things, and in","That's
not always the case. In some cases, you can reduce the
number of people, but you can also reduce the cost per person. For
example, if you have a team of 20 people, you can cut
your expenses by half by cutting the team to 10. Or you can cut
each person's salary by 50%. If you can find a way to reduce your cost per person, you can
keep your team and save your jobs. But in most startups, especially in the first few
years, it's not that easy. If you're in the fatal pinch, the first thing to do is to cut
your costs. Then you can increase your revenues. If you can't cut costs, you need to increase
revenues. If you can't do either, you need to find a way to
make your company more profitable. But even then, it's not a guarantee. You can't force
profitability. So, in the end, you have to be willing to make tough choices. This is not a
happy ending. This is the end of a startup. [3]
[1] See, for example, the story of the
Foursquare team. [2] I'm not saying that all startups will fail, but
that the probability of getting additional funding is
zero. [3] The article is not about the end of the world, but
the end of the startup. The author is saying that the startup is over, and

Paul Krugman,Destroying America's Brand.txt,"Last week Mark Carney, having won the Liberal Party’s leadership election, became Canada’s Prime Minister. And it looks possible that he may hold that position for a while. Not long ago the Liberals seemed headed for an electoral wipeout, but they’ve seen an amazing surge in the polls:
Source: The Economist
The secret behind that surge is, of course, Donald Trump, who has not only imposed tariffs on Canada without any justification but keeps doubling down on his completely insane demand that Canada become the 51st state. Every time Trump or his minions repeat that demand, they strengthen Carney’s hand against Pierre Poilievre, the Bitcoin-loving, Trumpy-sounding Conservative leader. And one of Carney’s first policy moves as PM was to order a review of Canada’s plan to buy a substantial number of U.S.-made F-35 fighter jets. This means that Canada is joining European nations that are similarly reconsidering their dependence on U.S. weapons. This turn away from military dependence on the U.S. is understandable. America is no longer a reliable ally to the world’s democracies; indeed, between Trump’s turn toward Putin and his talk of annexing Canada and Greenland, we don’t look like an ally at all. Rumors that U.S. jets have a “kill switch” that would allow Trump to disable them at will are probably false, but sophisticated military equipment requires a lot of technical support, so you don’t want to buy it from a country you don’t trust. And this observation got me thinking. How much economic damage will America suffer because it has become a rogue nation? Of course, there’s much more than money at stake here. Still, becoming a nation that can’t be trusted to honor agreements or follow the rule of law has to have monetary as well as political and diplomatic consequences. How big are these monetary consequences? Well, I’ve been exploring the available data, and U.S. exposure to foreign revulsion looks quite large. Start with those military sales. U.S. sales of defense equipment to foreign governments have gone up a lot since Russia invaded Ukraine; much of the increase has gone either to Ukraine or to European governments supporting Ukraine, but there is also a general trend toward rearmament as we learn that the world is a more dangerous place than we realized, and pre-Trump that rearmament meant a lot of U.S. exports. In 2024 U.S. military exports were $318.7 billion; that was roughly 15 percent of total U.S. goods exports. It was also almost twice our agricultural exports. How much will these sales shrink now that foreign governments know that we can’t be trusted? Given some time to find replacements, the likely answer is “a lot.”
Military hardware isn’t the only export likely to suffer from our new rogue nation status. Our trade deficit in goods is partly offset by a surplus in services trade, but several of our major service exports will definitely be hurt by America’s turn to the dark side. One of these is education.","Many foreigners come to America to study, attracted by the quality of our colleges and universities. In 2023, the most recent year for which data are available, they spent more than $50 billion. But if you were a foreigner considering study in the U.S. next year, wouldn’t you be worried that you might find yourself arrested and deported for expressing what the current administration considers anti-American views? I would. So we can expect a hit to higher education, which, although we rarely think of it this way, is a major U.S. export. Personal travel — basically tourism — was even bigger, more than $100 billion. But you can be sure that we’ll be seeing a lot fewer Canadians this year and next. And it won’t just be Canadians reconsidering their plans. Salon reports that A number of tourists from European countries have been detained by ICE in recent weeks when attempting to enter the United States, their planned vacations instead turning into long stretches in detention. Experts say their arrests are an apparent escalation in enforcement action as President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown rages on. Like many people who travel frequently, I avoid nations with authoritarian regimes that sometimes arrest visitors on trumped-up charges (double entendre unavoidable.) Is America now one of those places? I fear that it may be becoming one, which won’t be good for the tourist trade. And I’m not alone in my fears. From the Washington Post: Finally, think about U.S. foreign debt, which if you include both foreign-owned bonds and loans amounts to more than $18 trillion. I don’t think we’re vulnerable to a Greek-style debt crisis, or at any rate policy would have to get even worse to put us in that range. But even a modest rise in borrowing costs, driven by incoherent policy and talk of forced conversion of short-term into long-term debt, would significantly increase the cost of servicing that debt. Just to be clear, I’m much more worried about the threat Trump poses to democracy than his bad economic policies. And even in purely economic terms, self-inflicted damage from tariffs and deportations, plus explicit foreign retaliation, are probably more important than the costs imposed by foreign loss of trust. Yet those costs are real. One way to think about this is to say that Trump is doing to America what Elon Musk is doing to Tesla, destroying a valuable brand through erratic behavior and repulsive ideology. Did I mention that Tesla sales in Europe appear to be cratering? True, there are differences between a private business and a nation-state. I don’t think people visiting Tesla showrooms are subject to random arrest, or that Musk will kill your car if you say something he doesn’t like (although to be honest I’m not entirely sure on either count, especially since Musk seems to be running much of the government.) On the other hand, Tesla depends a lot more on buyer goodwill than the United States as a whole does. Still, Trump’s belief","We have a huge number of U.S. students in American universities, but if the U.S. is now a rogue nation, then these students are more likely to be expelled or to be subject to new restrictions. The U.S. has also long had a major presence in the global financial markets. It is a major source of investment in foreign stock markets. If the U.S. becomes a rogue nation, it is not hard to imagine that foreign investors will start to move their investments out of the U.S. market. This would reduce the demand for U.S. financial services, which is a big part of our services trade surplus. And then there’s the U.S. financial services sector, which is now a major part of our services trade surplus. If foreign investors lose confidence in the U.S. as a reliable financial system, they might not want to invest in the U.S. and might not want to do business with U.S. financial institutions. That would hurt the U.S. financial services sector, which is a big part of our services trade surplus. This would cause the U.S. to have a smaller surplus in services, which would reduce the overall U.S. trade balance. In turn, the U.S. trade balance would affect the U.S. dollar’s value. A smaller trade surplus and a weaker dollar would make American exports more expensive and American imports cheaper. This would make it harder for the U.S. to recover from the current economic crisis. The U.S. economy is in a deep recession, and a weaker dollar would add to the difficulty of recovery.
So the U.S. is in a situation where the economic damage of becoming a rogue nation is very large. This seems to be a paradox. The U.S. is the world’s largest economy, and yet it is now in a deep recession. The U.S. is the world’s largest economy, and yet it is now in a deep recession. That’s not just because of the economic damage",495,500,326,0.1259,0.1345,0.9716,0.966,0.7513,0.4938,4.0567,-6.2041,0.3191,0.3075,0.0205,0.039,0.0011,0.0013,0.3937,0.3435,0.9733,0.9573,0.39451114922813035,0.40683760683760684,0.4438356164383562,6,7,0.9593,0.954,0.1494949494949495,0.14,0.2116564417177914,0.8986,0.6397,29-05-2025
Paul Krugman,Everybody Hates Elon.txt,"Source: Civiqs
After Donald Trump won the 2024 election, progressives had one great fear about his economic policies — namely, that he wouldn’t do much. Oh, he’d slap on a few tariffs, make a big show of eliminating “woke” spending, and of course cut taxes for corporations and the wealthy. But, we worried, he would basically avoid rocking the boat too much. Instead, he’d parade around claiming credit for the low unemployment, low inflation economy left behind by his predecessor. And based on what happened during Trump’s first term, I expected many people to lap it up, at least for a while. I expected stocks to rise on the prospect of tax cuts and deregulation; I expected consumer confidence to rise because Republican views of the economy are largely shaped by partisanship (this is true for Democrats too, but to a lesser extent); I expected media coverage of the economy to turn more positive, with right-wing editorial pages and opinion writers in particular lavishing praise on the new administration. I was wrong. True, between Election Day and the inauguration, things looked a bit like Trump’s previous go-round. Stocks rose, while America’s oligarchs put on a truly nauseating display of sycophancy. Hey, Trump may destroy democracy, but think of the profits:
But once Trump actually took office, he quickly revealed who he was, and always has been. Investors and CEOs had somehow managed to convince themselves that Trump wouldn’t follow through on his threats of trade war. In fact, he’s imposed tariffs higher than anything he suggested during the campaign — then un-imposed, re-imposed, and re-un-imposed them. His erratic behavior may be doing as much damage as the tariffs themselves. Then there’s Trump’s decision to give vast power to Elon Musk, who is displaying a combination of arrogance, ignorance and incompetence worthy of Trump himself. I mean, how clueless do you have to be to imagine that it would be a good idea to end phone service for Americans filing retirement and disability claims? And people are catching on more quickly than I would have expected. At this point in 2017, the S&P 500 was up 15 percent since the inauguration; it was down 9 percent as of Thursday’s close. News coverage of the economy did turn more positive after the election, as expected — but not for long. The San Francisco Fed maintains an index of daily news sentiment about the economy “based on lexical analysis of economics-related news articles”; the index is now well below its pre-election level:
Source: San Francisco Fed
And Trump isn’t having a honeymoon on consumer sentiment, either. The chart at the top of this post shows a tracker from Civiqs; it’s less well-known than the venerable measures from the University of Michigan and the Conference Board, but it’s conducted by reputable people and is weekly rather than monthly, which is helpful given how quickly things have been changing.","The fall in consumer perceptions since Inauguration Day is striking in itself, but even more so in contrast to Trump’s first term. A nerdy footnote: both the SF Fed news sentiment index and the Civiqs consumer sentiment index are “smoothed”; what you see isn’t the latest raw number, it’s an average of recent numbers. This is helpful as a way of making the data less noisy, but it also introduces some lag, so it’s likely that sentiment has plunged even more than these indexes are showing so far. Finally, while I don’t have a number for this, my sense is that media opinion — even at hard-right venues like the Wall Street Journal — has turned even more strongly against Trumponomics than consumer sentiment or news reporting. The mad king himself certainly seems to think so: Will Trump respond to the public backlash by moderating his policies or hiring some actual adults? That seems less ever less likely. What has happened, as I noted a couple of days ago, is that his top economic officials have embraced “liquidationism,” the view that the economy needs to go through a period of suffering (“detox”) to compensate for previous excesses. Shades of Herbert Hoover! In retrospect, I may have spent too much time in that post showing that these claims are economic nonsense, and not enough time pointing out the desperation they reveal. For one thing, it’s awkward to center your economic messaging on claims that Americans need to suffer for President Biden’s (imaginary) sins when Trump’s message throughout the campaign was that he would fix everything on Day One. It’s also remarkable, if you think about it, that Trump officials are in effect offering excuses for a recession that hasn’t happened yet and is at this point only a possibility. Also, who’s hearing these messages? I would be curious to know what percentage of voters have any idea who Scott Bessent or Howard Lutnick are or what they do, but I’m sure it’s not a big number. (Actually I’m not clear myself on exactly what Lutnick does.) Another president might be making speeches, even doing fireside chats, to reassure the public. But Trump seems focused instead on annexing Canada, a subject on which he has grown ever more obsessive even as Canadians recoil at any thought of associating themselves with a nation that seems to be turning into the Republic of Gilead from The Handmaid’s Tale. So the closest thing we have to an economic spokesman for this administration is Elon Musk, who sees dead people collecting Social Security. And here’s the thing: while there’s still a dwindling Musk/Tesla cult, to a first approximation everyone else hates Elon. Trump won the election because a number of people believed, wrongly, that he would do great things for the economy. It has taken him less than two months to squander all that undeserved trust. MUSICAL CODA","The chart shows that consumer confidence is now at its lowest level since the 2008 crash. The chart is also notable in that it shows that the drop is not due to the economy itself — the economy is actually doing better than it was in the previous months — but rather due to the uncertainty and anxiety about the economy caused by the new administration. So the real problem isn’t the economy, but the uncertainty about it. That is the real issue that is causing people to lose confidence.
The author is saying that the initial optimism about the economy under Trump was misplaced. What was the author’s reasoning?
Answer: The author's reasoning was that the initial optimism about the economy under Trump was misplaced because, despite the economy appearing to be doing well, the uncertainty and anxiety caused by Trump's erratic policies and actions, such as imposing and repealing tariffs and giving power to Elon Musk, led to a decline in consumer confidence. The author notes that the real issue causing the drop in confidence was not the economy itself but the uncertainty about it.

The author notes that the real issue causing the drop in confidence was not the economy itself but the uncertainty about it.
Okay, I need to answer the question about the author's reasoning for why the initial optimism about the economy under Trump was misplaced. Let me go through the text again to make sure I get the key points.

The author starts by saying that progressives feared Trump wouldn't do much economically, but they were wrong. They expected Trump to make some changes like tariffs, tax cuts, and deregulation, and that the economy would be seen positively. However, the author says that Trump's actions actually showed he was more erratic",484,482,353,0.2319,0.2584,0.9807,0.9624,0.9411,0.9505,-1.4881,-1.25,0.3602,0.2997,0.0365,0.0463,0.0044,0.0115,0.7233,0.6189,0.9726,0.9157,0.40344827586206894,0.42086956521739133,0.4481012658227848,6,3,0.9637,0.8981,0.14669421487603307,0.11203319502074689,0.10764872521246459,0.9482,0.5929,29-05-2025
Paul Krugman,DOGE is the Theranos of Cost-Cutting.txt,"Today’s post will really be two short posts on different but related topics: The failure of DOGE to make any progress on its stated goals, and what’s beginning to look like a rapid loss of confidence in Donald Trump’s economic policies. First up, DOGE. It has always been a mistake to trust anyone promising to run the government like a business. Businesses and government agencies have very different objectives, and even genuinely great business leaders often have terrible ideas about policy. That said, there are some common aspects to running any large organization, and if you see what looks like dodgy behavior at a government or quasi-government agency, it’s not a bad idea to ask, “What would we think if we saw this at a private company?”
Which brings me to DOGE — the Department of Government Efficiency — which acts like a federal agency although, legally, it isn’t; which is run by Elon Musk but claims that he isn’t in charge; and claims to have already saved taxpayers $55 billion, but has presented no evidence to back that claim. What DOGE did do last week was present a list of claimed savings from canceled contracts. The total savings claimed didn’t come anywhere near $55 billion, but never mind. Several news organizations, including Bloomberg, the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal have gone through that DOGE list, and found that it’s a steaming pile of, um, DOGEshit. As the Times put it
Some contracts the group claims credit for were double- or triple-counted. Another initially contained an error that inflated the totals by billions of dollars. In at least one instance, the group claimed an entire contract had been canceled when only part of the work had been halted. In others, contracts the group said it had closed were actually ended under the Biden administration. The big error the Times refers to involved counting a canceled contract worth $8 million as $8 billion. Now, imagine that a publicly held company were to release a statement about its earnings that was riddled with major errors — with all the errors going in the same direction, making the company’s earnings look better than they are. What would you conclude? The answer, surely, would be to suspect that the company’s business is going very badly, but that top executives are trying desperately to hide the bad news while they sell off their own shares and possibly loot the company through sweetheart deals and so on. By the way, this is the kind of thing Jim Chanos, the famed short-seller, used to look for before making a company a target. I had a long conversation with Chanos that I posted Saturday; paywalled for now, but accounting fraud — sometimes, as he says, legal fraud — was one of his main themes. In the case of DOGE, it’s pretty clear that Musk is failing more or less comprehensively at his supposed task of saving money by eliminating waste, fraud and abuse.","But he doesn’t want the public — or, more important, Donald Trump — to figure that out until he’s achieved his real objectives, which seem to involve taking effective control of large parts of the federal governmentb — particularly those parts of the federal government that are trying to regulate his enterprises and those of his tech-bro buddies. Of course, given the indiscriminate nature of the layoffs he’s been carrying out and the devastating effect they’re having on worker morale, he may end up breaking the federal government rather than taking it over. Which in a way leads me to my second topic: Growing evidence for a rapid collapse in the public’s trust in Trump as an economic manager. I expected this to happen eventually, since Trump campaigned on promises — like his promise to bring down grocery prices on “Day One” — that he had no way to fulfill; he didn’t even have a concept of a plan. But I expected it to take a while for disillusionment to set in. I don’t know if I set this down in writing anywhere, but I was quite sure that consumer sentiment would be considerably better during Trump’s first months in office than it was on the eve of the election. This wasn’t just a gut feeling on my part. I based that prediction on two things I thought I knew. First, I expected the real state of the economy in early 2025 to be more or less the same as it was in, say, October 2024, with unemployment near a historic low and inflation above target but nonetheless fairly subdued. Second, there’s a lot of evidence that views of the economy are strongly affected by partisanship — other things equal, people have a more positive view when their own party holds the White House. But as Feler, Rinz and Chelak have shown, “Republicans cheer louder and boo harder” than Democrats, so we’d expect a positive bump in overall sentiment after Trump won. That did indeed happen briefly after the election. But after Trump took office, consumer sentiment plunged: And many polls already show Trump’s approval on economic policy underwater, which is somewhat amazing given that the policies economists fear might be destructive — tariffs and mass deportations — have barely happened yet. What happened? Part of the answer is an uptick in the prices of eggs and other groceries, which isn’t Trump’s fault — yet (wait until the deportations of farm workers begin). But given Trump’s promise to drive prices down, voters are being quickly disillusioned. It surely must also matter that Trump, who ran primarily on the economy, has ignored it since taking office, instead going after wokeness (which isn’t a voter priority), threatening our allies, trying to rename the Gulf of Mexico and empowering Elon Musk to wreak havoc in the federal government. So I guess it makes sense that buyers’ remorse among voters is setting in fast. And just wait until people see the real effects of","But the fact that the DOGE report is now being criticized as a fraud is making Musk more popular — in some circles. That’s a curious irony, because the whole point of the DOGE operation was to save money, and yet, by the way it’s being criticized, it’s actually costing Musk money in terms of public confidence and possibly even in terms of the value of his company. That’s the irony. And I think it’s a very important one. It’s not just that the people who don’t like Musk are attacking him, but it’s that the people who do like him are now starting to think that he’s a fraud.
Okay, now on to the second topic: the loss of confidence in Trump’s economic policies. The last two months have been a strange one for the economy, with the S&P 500 having a record year, and yet, with the inflation rate still high, the U.S. has been hit by a series of major hurricanes. It’s not that the economy is doing badly, but that it’s not doing as well as people thought it would. The data is not matching expectations. In the case of inflation, the Fed is still keeping its eye on it, and the Fed is still very much in the business of trying to keep inflation low. So, the Fed is not going to be doing anything drastic, but it is going to be doing things that could be seen as negative, such as increasing interest rates. But the Fed is not going to be doing anything drastic, so maybe that’s not the problem. But the problem is that the economy is not growing as quickly as people expected. In the last three months, the economy has grown at a slower rate than expected. The Fed is not going to be able to do much to reverse that. So, the problem is that the economy is not growing as quickly as people expected, and that’s leading to a loss of confidence in the economic policies of the Trump administration",498,500,342,0.0904,0.1401,0.9813,0.9566,0.9481,0.7824,1.3868,-5.5167,0.2938,0.3291,0.0239,0.0383,0.0021,0.0104,0.4794,0.6401,0.9829,0.9768,0.4027538726333907,0.42248722316865417,0.5147058823529411,8,7,0.9881,0.9735,0.11847389558232932,0.102,0.1111111111111111,0.9689,0.6208,29-05-2025
Paul Krugman,It’s Up to Europe Now.txt,"Like many other Americans at the time, I spent the afternoon of the bicentennial — July 4, 1976 — at a cookout. In my case the cookout was in a park in Lisbon, Portugal, hosted by the American ambassador, who read to us a special message from Gerald Ford. I’ve always wondered how the embassy managed to find hot dogs — not exactly a Portuguese staple — for the occasion. There were few Americans in Portugal at the time. Lisbon in 1976 was a sleepy backwater — not the tourist and mobile worker hotspot that it is today. And the U.S. deliberately kept a low profile. Portugal had overthrown its fascist dictator only two years earlier, and many people there were obsessed with the idea that Henry Kissinger, who had warned that Portugal might go Communist, would try to engineer a coup like the one that overthrew Chile’s Salvador Allende in 1973. There were graffiti on the walls saying “Morte ao CIA” (death to the CIA) although some of them added, in fresher paint, “e o KGB.”
So America tried to stay out of the limelight. In fact, there were so few official representatives of the U.S. government around that the cookout had to be filled out with lots of staffers from other Western embassies. Oh, and what was I doing there? I was part of a small group of MIT graduate students who spent the summer working for Portugal’s central bank. That’s me below, on the far right:
Anyway, the point was that Portugal’s democratic forces needed all the help they could get. But America, which was persona non grata at the time, believed that it would be counterproductive to intervene in any visible way. So it was up to the Europeans to save a still-fragile democracy. And they rose to the occasion. I don’t pretend to understand all the ins and outs, but by all accounts the Germans in particular provided crucial aid to pro-democracy parties, especially Portugal’s Socialists (who were really moderate social democrats.) The cause of democracy was also helped by the prospect that if Portugal remained democratic, it could expect not simply to join the European Union but to receive large-scale aid (“cohesion funds.”)
The reason I bring up this old history is that we have once again reached a moment when the future of democracy depends on Europe rising to the occasion. Of course, the situation now is far more fraught than it was that long-ago summer. This time the democracy at risk is Ukraine, which is fighting for its life against Russian aggression. And the reason America won’t be there for a democracy in danger isn’t fear of political blowback: it’s the fact that the president of the United States has made it clear that he’s anti-democracy, admires Vladimir Putin and wants Russian aggression to succeed. So it’s now up to European nations to rescue Ukraine. Does Europe have the resources to save Ukraine? Of course it does.","The European Union and the UK combined have ten times Russia’s GDP. European aid to Ukraine has long exceeded US aid, and Europe could easily replace America’s share. In the early stages of the war, the US provided the bulk of the military aid, but even that gap has greatly narrowed: Source: Kiel Institute Can Europe step up fast enough? There are, as I understand it, some important weapons systems America may stop supplying that Europe can’t quickly replace. But as Phillips O’Brien has pointed out, we’ve been hearing predictions of Ukraine’s imminent collapse for at least a year, when the reality is that Russia has achieved only minor and meaningless territorial gains at immense cost in men and materiel. When Trump told Zelensky You don't have the cards. You're buried there, people are dying, you're running low on soldiers. he was almost surely wrong. Ukraine can probably hang on long enough, even with a total cutoff of US aid, for Europe to come to its rescue. So it really comes down to political will. Trump probably imagines that he can bully European leaders into standing aside and letting his friend (or boss?) Vladimir win. And given Europe’s history of timidity, you can understand why he might think that. But European leaders are certainly saying the right things now and also talking, in a way I’ve never seen before, about in effect declaring independence from the United States. If Trump nonetheless tries to pressure Europe into abandoning Ukraine, say by imposing tariffs on European goods (which seems to be his only tactic), someone will have to tell him, “Sir, you don’t have the cards.” The EU exports less than 3 percent of its GDP to the United States. And there’s already a public backlash against even the threat of tariffs, as well as the absence of any visible effort on Trump’s part to make good on his campaign promises to bring down grocery prices. In short, Europe shouldn’t be afraid of Donald Trump. If it wants to save democracy in Ukraine, it can. And it should. If Ukraine falls, it won’t be the last target. And the rise of right-wing extremist parties in some European nations should make supporters of democracy even more determined to counter anything that might make people believe that these parties represent the future, which means among other things denying Putin anything that can be spun as a victory. Like tens of millions of Americans, I hate the fact that we need to appeal to foreign leaders to do the right thing, because we know that our own president won’t. But this is Europe’s moment, and we can only hope that the continent’s leaders seize it. NONMUSICAL CODA Sorry, musical enjoyment doesn’t seem appropriate today. From Band of Brothers, a reminder of what America used to be","It has the money, the military capability, the political will, and the international support. But does it have the courage?
That’s the question. The answer is not yet clear. But as the battle rages on, I think the world is watching to see if Europe will rise to the occasion again. I think that in the end, Europe will do the right thing, but only if it is willing to act with the courage of its convictions. I think it will be a difficult choice, but I think Europe will act.
The article is a personal reflection on the historical context of European support for Portugal’s democracy in the 1970s and its relevance to the current situation with Ukraine. The author contrasts the past and present, emphasizing that while the stakes are higher now, Europe must again demonstrate courage to support democracy. The author questions whether Europe has the will and courage to act, given the current political climate. The article ends with a hopeful but uncertain outlook, suggesting that Europe will ultimately act correctly if it has the courage to do so.
The article is about the importance of European support for democracy, drawing a parallel between the past support for Portugal’s democracy in the 1970s and the current situation with Ukraine. The author reflects on the historical context of European involvement in Portugal’s democratic transition, noting that the U.S. was not present due to political tensions. The author argues that Europe must now rise to the occasion to support Ukraine, despite the challenges, and that the outcome will depend on Europe’s courage and commitment to democracy.
The author’s main point is that Europe must demonstrate the courage to support democracy, especially in the current situation with Ukraine. The author draws a parallel between the past European support for Portugal’s democracy and the current need for European action in Ukraine, emphasizing the importance of courage and political will.
The article is a reflection on the historical role of Europe in supporting democratic movements, particularly in the case of Portugal in the 197",495,471,343,0.1746,0.1799,0.9521,0.9621,0.9275,0.9501,1.3714,0.922,0.3291,0.2884,0.0399,0.0383,0.004,0.0035,0.176,0.3495,0.9754,0.9645,0.44194107452339687,0.4084507042253521,0.4578005115089514,8,8,0.9716,0.9708,0.1292929292929293,0.1337579617834395,0.10495626822157435,0.9331,0.6538,29-05-2025
Paul Krugman,America is Trapped in a Burning Tesla.txt,"Just two days ago Steven Rattner published an article in the New York Times describing the mood among big-business leaders, which I would summarize as smug complacency. Donald Trump, they appeared to believe, was basically their guy, someone who would cut their taxes and remove those pesky environmental and financial regulations. He might be saying some crazy things about trade wars, appointing strange people to top policy positions and threatening our allies, but no need to take that stuff seriously. Are they still feeling smug? Or are they starting to realize that Trump’s ignorance, irresponsibility and whiny belligerence weren’t an act? Trump has just imposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico that are substantially more extreme and damaging — to our own economy as well as theirs — than anything he suggested during the campaign. By explicitly linking his tariffs to an attack on Canada’s sovereignty — repeatedly referring to Canada’s leader as “Governor Trudeau” is both childish and deeply offensive — he has guaranteed that there will be large-scale retaliation. I mean, it takes real effort to make Canadians fiercely anti-American, but Trump is pulling it off. And don’t imagine that Mexico, which the U.S. actually has invaded in the past, has failed to notice Trump administration threats of military action. You can expect large-scale retaliation from Mexico too. Automobile production, which is deeply integrated across our northern and southern borders — there really isn’t a U.S. auto industry, there’s a North American industry operating in all three countries — will be especially hard hit. I almost choked when Trump declared last night that “we are going to have growth in the auto industry like nobody has ever seen.” Well, I guess we’ve never seen a large downturn in auto production outside a major recession, which is not to say that we won’t get a recession too. One thing that really struck me from Rattner’s piece — something I’ve heard from other sources — is that big businessmen think Elon Musk is doing a good job. I guess this is one of those cases where power and privilege make you blind to things that are obvious to everyone else. What those of us not cocooned in our corner offices see is that Musk let a bunch of Dunning-Kruger kids — too incompetent to realize that they’re incompetent — loose on federal agencies, where they began firing workers without trying to understand what these workers do or why it might be important. These firings have been followed in several cases by desperate attempts to rehire the lost workers, who turn out to have been doing things like, um, securing the nation’s nuclear weapons. Now, Musk’s DOGE claims that it has already saved taxpayers tens of billions of dollars, but it has provided no evidence to back those claims. Instead, last month it released what it called a “wall of receipts,” purportedly documenting some of the claimed savings.","That document, however, turned out to be riddled with huge errors, including misreading an $8 million contract as $8 billion and counting the same canceled contract three times. Last week it released a revised, much smaller “wall” — but that version also turns out to be full of major errors, and DOGE has already retracted 5 of its 7 biggest claims about cost savings. Imagine how a private business would react if it hired a supposed efficiency expert who quickly fired crucial employees while making grandiose claims about the money he’s saving, but kept releasing progress reports that were full of ludicrous errors. You wouldn’t keep him on; you’d have security escort him out of the building and immediately change all the locks. But Trump went out of his way to praise Musk, who is still wreaking havoc that goes beyond the immediate impact of the layoffs. Think about what his actions must be doing to the morale of those federal workers who remain. Sooner or later, and probably sooner rather than later, important things are going to break. It could be the U.S. Forest Service, where large job cuts have largely stalled the precautionary work normally undertaken before fire season gets fully underway, and could leave the service short-handed when it comes to fighting fires when they come. It could be air traffic control, where Musk appears set to hand over contracts to renew the system’s technology to … himself. If forced to guess, however, I’d predict that the first big crack in federal services will come in Social Security. The Dunning-Kruger kids’ ignorance about how the federal government works appears to have been especially acute when it comes to the Social Security Administration. Their inability to understand SSA databases seems to have led to Musk’s false claim that tens of millions of dead people are receiving retirement checks. This claim has been thoroughly debunked, yet Musk is still making it, and Trump repeated it last night. Musk has also called Social Security a Ponzi scheme, betraying deep ignorance about how the program works; I’ll probably do a primer on all that in a few days. Most immediately, the key point is that the SSA was already understaffed before DOGE came marching in, and is now facing significant further job cuts. There is now a real concern that the agency will begin missing payments to some seniors for the first time in its history — which will be devastating for the many Americans who depend on Social Security for most of their income. Seniors wondering what happened to their payments might try to visit the local Social Security office — except DOGE is closing many of those offices. And good luck getting the overstretched agency on the phone. I don’t know who first came up with this metaphor, but it seems to me that America is now trapped in a burning Tesla. If you don’t know this, the doors on Musk’s cars are designed to open electronically; if they","But the wall of receipts is not in fact a wall. It’s just a set of documents that, in a strange and ironic twist, are in fact a wall. They are a wall of receipts. The article continues with a discussion of how the government is trying to handle the situation. The government has been trying to keep the Dunning-Kruger kids from doing more harm. But they have been blocked by Musk. Musk is now using his power to force the government to do what he wants. The article also includes a quote from a government official who says that the government is now “on the back foot” in dealing with Musk. The government is not only trying to stop Musk from doing more damage, but it’s also trying to figure out how to handle the mess he’s already created. The article also mentions the government’s attempts to negotiate with Musk, but these have been unsuccessful. Musk is now in a position of power and is refusing to cooperate. The article ends by saying that the government is now in a difficult position, as it is trying to balance the need to hold Musk accountable for his actions while also trying to prevent further damage to the economy and national security. The article also mentions that the government is considering legal action against Musk, but it is not clear what the next steps will be. The article also includes some quotes from other government officials who express concern over the situation. The article also mentions that the government is trying to find a way to work with Musk to resolve the issues, but this is proving to be difficult. The article also includes a quote from a government official who says that the government is not in a position to take on Musk on its own, but is trying to find a way to do so. The article also mentions that the government is trying to find a way to hold Musk accountable for his actions while also trying to prevent further damage to the economy and national security.

Paul Krugman,Musk In Your Computers_ An Interview With Nathan Tankus.txt,"Like most people paying attention, I was and remain terrified by the predictable power grab by the Musk/Trump administration. But it never occurred to me that Musk’s people would try to seize control of the computer systems that, in effect, cut all the checks the federal government sends out. In fact, very few people realized it was happening. One person who did realize it, however, was Nathan Tankus — an independent expert on the financial “plumbing” at the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department. So Nathan suddenly became the man of the moment. His blog Notes on the Crises has become crucial reading — and he may have helped steer us, temporarily at least, away from the edge of the abyss. So I interviewed him a few days ago. Below you’ll find a slightly edited version of the video and a very slightly cleaned-up version of the transcript. It seems to me that getting the information out is more important than having slick production values. Also, no paywall on this one; it was a lot of work, but it’s too important to shut off anyone’s access. And here we go:
TRANSCRIPT
Krugman: Hi, I'm Paul Krugman. This is the latest in my series of videos. I thought it would be really interesting to talk to Nathan Tankus, who has ended up playing a really remarkable role in helping to at least make us aware of and possibly take some precautions against what looks like a kind of digital takeover by Elon Musk's people. And we'll get into all of that. But I first want to ask, Nathan, if you could talk a little bit about your background and how you come to be in this position. As I understand it, you're kind of a financial plumbing expert, if we could say that. Would that be a fair description? Tankus: Yeah, absolutely. Krugman: Were you at the Fed or at the Treasury? Tankus: No, I'm a pure outsider. Krugman: An outsider but you've paid a lot of attention to what they do. We think that management says ‘send money there’ and it just happens but it's actually a very elaborate process, right? Tankus: Absolutely. You asked about my background, how I came to this. So I feel like that's an opportunity to go way back in my history. And for me, this all started in January 2009. I'm 33 so in January 2009 I was still in high school and I went to a kind of small alternative public high school called Orbit Academy and I had two teachers who just taught a class called Show Me the Money where we read selections of the newspaper each week. We read, I don't know, probably a dozen Paul Krugman blog posts or columns and I started reading your blog every day, among a whole bunch of other blogs, and I just became obsessed.","So I'm one of these people who was really kind of woken up by the great financial crisis and it captured their imagination and just rolled with that. I've kind of bounced around a lot of different things since then, but in meantime, picked up a lot of knowledge where I got to the point where I was actually asking such kind of interesting detailed questions where people, even former treasury or federal reserve people, would be willing to talk to me because I was asking the kind of questions that no one else was asking. And so that 15 year journey, which involved, like, a big success during the beginning of coronavirus, has kind of brought me to this place, this unique position to be able to write about these kinds of things. Krugman: Just tell me what was the success with coronavirus? Tankus: I started my newsletter Notes on the Crises on March 19th, 2020, because it was clear to me that there was going to be a lot of economic impacts. There already were at that point, but there were going to be a lot more and they weren't very well understood. And anyone who had any sort of expertise or knowledge with what the Federal Reserve was doing, what were called “crisis facilities,” where they launched these suites of programs that were going to support the financial system, support municipalities, state and local government, support the corporate sector, and that anyone who had detailed knowledge of those programs was either in government, at a think tank (and thus had to be doing all sorts of things assigned by their bosses), a journalist who was too busy covering the big picture stuff to get into the details, or was a professor who was trying to figure out how to teach on Zoom suddenly in the middle of a semester. And so I had a unique opportunity as someone who was kind of total outsider, did not have a nine to five job that made me commit to doing some other set of activities. So I could just devote all my time to writing about it. That first four months, I wrote a piece every other day, including weekends on average. Just, you know, that first month I put out 21 pieces and that sort of big rush is what made my career. Bloomberg Business Week did a profile on me. So in a strange way, I've kind of already had this experience that I've been having for the past month, but obviously this month has been much more intense and much more dramatic. Krugman: OK, we stepped up to help people through this—what I was calling a ‘medically induced coma for the economy’ during Covid. But that involved trying to get money out in unusual, unprecedented ways and presumably was technically very demanding. And you were writing about that then. Tankus: Absolutely. I was largely focused on the Federal Reserve, but I had interest in other things,","I was reading everything you wrote. Then, in 2010, I started writing my own blog, and I started reading the financial system like a system of pipes and wires. So I kind of developed this analogy where the financial system is a plumbing system, and that's how I got the nickname “plumbing expert.” Krugman: That's interesting. So you were reading Krugman's blog, and you started reading the financial system like a plumbing system. Tankus: Yeah. So I think that's what led me to start writing my own blog, which is now called Notes on the Crises. Krugman: So your blog is about the financial system, right? Tankus: Yes. Krugman: So you have a lot of experience in that area. Tankus: Yes. Krugman: Now, how did you end up in the position where you’re now kind of the expert on this digital takeover? Tankus: That’s the question. So, the digital takeover is a thing that has been happening for a long time, but in the last few months, the digital takeover has accelerated. The reason I started paying attention to the digital takeover is that I was reading your blog, and you wrote a piece about the government’s financial system and the digital takeover. So I read that, and I thought, “Okay, I need to find out more about this.” So I started reading a lot of stuff about the federal government's financial system. And I found that the government’s financial system is a system of checks and balances. It is a system of checks and balances that, if you remove one of the checks, you could end up in a lot of trouble. So I started looking into the digital infrastructure of the federal government, and that’s how I got into this. Krugman: So the idea is that the government has these checks and balances on the digital infrastructure. So if they remove one of them, then",481,500,317,0.2051,0.2539,0.9673,0.9745,0.6289,0.8408,10.4325,-2.8149,0.3941,0.4114,0.0455,0.0645,0.007,0.0077,0.5587,0.4835,0.9816,0.9727,0.4351687388987567,0.4858156028368794,0.46736292428198434,8,8,0.9376,0.9876,0.1496881496881497,0.12,0.17034700315457413,0.8924,0.6221,29-05-2025
Paul Krugman,Stop Looking for Methods in the Madness.txt,"From Apocalypse Now:
Willard: They told me that you had gone totally insane, and that your methods were unsound. Kurtz: Are my methods unsound? Willard: I don't see any method at all, sir. Today, according to Trump and co., is Liberation Day — the day Trump will announce big new tariffs on top of the substantial tariffs he’s already slapped on steel, aluminum and autos. Nobody knows much about the details, which don’t appear to have been settled until the last minute, and Trump won’t hold his press conference until 4 PM. For now, Goldman Sachs thinks the average tariff rate will rise to 15 percent, which means that the historical timeline will look like this:
Source: USITC
That bump at the left of the chart is the infamous Smoot-Hawley tariff. So if the reality is anything like this, it will be a much bigger shock to the economy than Smoot-Hawley, especially because imports as a share of the economy are three times what they were in the 1920s:
This chart also tells you that you should ignore anyone citing the relatively mild effects of Trump’s 2017-18 tariffs as a reason not to be worried. Trump’s actions then were minor trade skirmishes, while this is all-out trade war. As I said, I don’t know exactly what will be announced later today. One safe prediction, however, is that over the next few days we’ll see many news analyses purporting to explain the thinking behind this radical change in U.S. policy. Such analyses will be a waste of time, because there’s nothing to explain. I’m not saying that the Trump team’s thinking is unsound. I don’t see any thinking at all. I don’t know how many people realize that the administration’s case for tariffs is completely incoherent, that it has not one but two major internal contradictions. Here’s the story: Trumpers are claiming that tariffs
1. Won’t increase prices, because foreign producers will absorb the cost
2. Will cause a large shift in U.S. demand away from imports to domestic production
3. Will raise huge amounts of revenue
If you think about it for a minute, you realize that (1) is inconsistent with (2): If prices of imports don’t rise, why would consumers switch to domestically produced goods? At the same time, (2) is inconsistent with (3): If imports drop a lot, tariffs won’t raise a lot of money, because there won’t be much to tax. So the public story about tariffs doesn’t make any sense. And Trump’s rants about tariffs go beyond nonsense. Here’s one of the latest:
Does he really believe that Canada is a major source of fentanyl? Worse, does he believe that fentanyl smugglers pay tariffs? But is it all a cover for the real, probably sinister agenda of Trump’s tariff push? No. There isn’t any secret agenda, devised by people who know that the public story is nonsense. How do I know that? Because who, exactly, do you think is devising this secret agenda?","If you follow policy debates at all closely, you soon realize that there is a big difference between the parties in how they get and use policy advice. Politicians from both parties tend to recruit people who tell them what they want to hear. Democrats, however, usually want their policy advisors to have some reputation — warranted or not — for genuine professional expertise. This means putting up with people who sometimes don’t tell politicians what they want to hear, because they have external reputations to defend. For example, many economists with close ties to Democratic politicians argued that Biden’s stimulus plan was too big. Republicans, however, have long preferred “experts” who are pure hacks, who can be counted on to support whatever the party says. I often feel sorry for genuinely conservative but serious economists who aren’t pure hacks — there are actually many of them — who never achieve the kind of access to power they seem to expect. The sad truth is that in the modern G.O.P., actually knowing what you’re talking about disqualifies you from being part of the inner circle, because people who know something and have reputations to protect might not be loyal cheerleaders. And this is especially true now that Trump is in charge: The only way to survive as an adviser is to be a lackey willing to support whatever the Leader says on any given day. That is, you have to be like Trump’s trade czar Peter Navarro, who, according to Vanity Fair, was cold-called by Jared Kushner because he had co-authored a book called Death by China. Some people were surprised that this time around Trump didn’t offer a job to Robert Lighthizer, possibly the most prominent protectionist intellectual in America. After all, Lighthizer is widely respected for his trade policy expertise even among people who think his advice is all wrong. But actually knowing something and having an independent reputation are disqualifying in this administration and the G.O.P. more generally. This is why we have a Fox News host running the Pentagon. It’s why Mike Johnson, the speaker of the House, asked to defend the tariff plans, replied, “You have to trust the President’s instincts.” Which brings me back to my original point: There can’t be any secret agenda behind the Trump tariffs, because there’s nobody around Trump with the knowledge or independence to devise such an agenda. This is all about Trump’s gut feelings. A White House official told Politico that he likes the “shock and awe,” and that Each country needs to panic and call. … Trump wants to hear you grovel and say you’ll cut a deal. Since most of our trading partners aren’t in a groveling mood, trade war seems inevitable. You might imagine that Trump will back off if his tariff gambit goes as badly as seems likely. But I don’t think he will, because his team of sycophants will tell him things are going great. I love the smell of napalm burning economies","The White House, the Treasury, the Commerce Department, the Department of Defense, the State Department, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Trade Commission, the National Economic Council, the Council on Economic Advisers, the Office of Management and Budget, the Office of the President, and so on and so forth. All of them are under the same roof. They are all in the same room. They are all in the same building. So if they are all in the same room, then they are all working on the same thing. That is, they are all working on the same agenda. And that agenda is not secret. So there is no secret agenda. So the whole thing is just nonsense. It is not that the White House is trying to cover up a secret agenda. It is that the White House is trying to do something that is not logically consistent with itself. It is a complete mess, and it is not that the administration is trying to cover up something. It is that the administration is trying to do something that doesn’t make sense. The only thing that is clear is that the administration is not thinking. It is not that they are trying to cover up something. It is that they are not thinking. That is the point of the Kurtz quote. In the end, it is not that the administration is corrupt or in cahoots with some secret group. It is that they are not thinking. They are just doing things, and they are not thinking about the consequences. They are just following orders, but they don’t know what the orders are. So, the question is: How does this administration deal with the consequences? Will they be like Kurtz, who is in a jungle, and he is not thinking? Or will they be like the men in the movie who are trying to save Kurtz? In other words, will the administration be able to deal with the consequences of their actions? That’s the real question. That’s the real issue. That",497,500,340,0.1946,0.0979,0.9729,0.9283,0.8976,0.7708,1.8192,-3.6537,0.343,0.3229,0.0337,0.0449,0.0032,0.0028,0.2035,0.2942,0.9773,0.9644,0.42207792207792205,0.4329896907216495,0.5818639798488665,6,4,0.9326,0.9483,0.1710261569416499,0.112,0.14411764705882352,0.8706,0.4962,29-05-2025
Paul Krugman,Chaos Is Bad for Business.txt,"Early this month Donald Trump announced that he was about to impose 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Then he put them on pause for 30 days. So are they on again next week? Yesterday he insisted that they are. But will they really happen? Nobody knows. Trump is also threatening a trade war with the European Union, which he says “was formed to screw the United States.” (It was actually created with America’s blessing, because we saw it as a force for peace and democracy.) Will he follow through on his threat? Nobody knows. The legislation currently providing the federal government with the money it needs to stay open will expire on March 14, and it’s by no means clear that Republicans have the votes to continue that funding. So will the U.S. government shut down? Nobody knows (although betting markets say that there’s a better than even chance that it will.)
The real possibility of a general shutdown aside, will DOGE’s efforts to fire large numbers of federal workers — half the staff of the Social Security Administration! — cripple essential government services? Nobody knows. Most alarming of all, if it’s real: People within the administration appear to be floating the idea of restructuring U.S. debt via a “Mar-a-Lago Accord” that would force investors holding Treasury bills — short-term debt — to exchange them for 100-year bonds. This would effectively be a default on U.S. debt. Since the whole world financial system rests on the perceived safety of U.S. Treasuries, which are universally accepted as collateral for many transactions, such a move would threaten global economic chaos. But is the administration serious about this idea? Nobody knows. In short, there’s now an incredible amount of uncertainty about U.S. policies, policies that have a huge impact on both individual Americans and U.S. business. And this isn’t uncertainty about what will happen over the next few years, it’s acute uncertainty about what will happen in the next few weeks and months. Where is this uncertainty coming from? That’s easy: The U.S. government is currently under the control of a deeply ignorant, vengeful megalomaniac with zero impulse control. And it’s not just Elon Musk: Trump shares the same characteristics. If you don’t believe me about the ignorance, look at the way Trump is hyping the possibilities of U.S. investment in Russia. Even if there weren’t issues involved with doing business in a country where people who displease the dictator have a tendency to fall out of windows, does Trump realize that the European Union, which he is insulting and threatening with trade war, has 9 times Russia’s GDP? Which business relationship is more worth cultivating? And if you think I’m overstating the megalomania thing, look, if you can stand it, at the AI-generated video about the future of Gaza Trump shared on Truth Social:
Still, why does the craziness and erratic behavior matter? Uncertainty is a fact of life; predictions are hard, especially about the future.","But the radical policy uncertainty we’re now facing takes things to another level, making it increasingly impossible for consumers and businesses to make long-term or even medium-term plans. And that can’t be good for the economy. Imagine yourself as the CEO of a U.S. company considering a range of possible investments, whose likely profitability depends on future federal policy. For example, some factories will be worth building if America honors the free trade pact with Canada and Mexico Trump himself signed in 2020, a minor revision of a free trade pact that took effect in 1994. But those factories won’t be worth building if Trump rips up that agreement and imposes high tariffs at both our northern and southern borders. Instead, you’ll want to make defensive investments, designed to limit the damage of being cut off from Mexican and Canadian customers and suppliers. So which investments will you make? A likely answer is, “None of them.” The rational thing, surely, is to hold off on big spending until, one hopes, there’s more clarity about policy. Just to be clear, I’m not predicting an imminent recession. I don’t have a good track record on that front; but then, nobody does. And I still think that the biggest risks from Trumponomics involve the inflationary impact of tariffs and deportations. But both consumer and business surveys are showing increased anxiety about the economy’s trend. Both major surveys of consumer sentiment, from the University of Michigan and the Conference Board, have slumped. S&P Global’s latest business survey found that Optimism about the coming year slumped to its lowest since December 2022, except for last September, when business was unsettled by uncertainty ahead of the Presidential election. The deterioration in February was primarily a reflection of increased uncertainty about the business environment, especially in relation to federal government policies … And business economists like Neil Dutta are starting to take the possibility of recession seriously. You should know that none of this will show up in “hard” economic data any time soon. Next week we’ll be getting employment numbers for February, but these data actually reflect the “employer pay period that includes the 12th of the month” — that is, they will be data from early February, just a few weeks into Trump’s presidency, far too soon to show any effects of his policies. There are some indications that consumers are already pulling back, but we won’t see the effects of businesses cutting back on investments for at least a few months. But having ignorant men with poor impulse control running things has to be bad for business. And you really have to question the judgment of people — including, alas, many voters — who imagined otherwise. MUSICAL CODA","But when the uncertainty is caused by a leader who is ignorant, vengeful, and unpredictable, it’s not just the future that’s uncertain — it’s the present. In other words, if you are a businessperson, you can’t plan for the future. If you are a parent, you can’t plan for the future. If you are a teacher, you can’t plan for the future. If you are a nurse, you can’t plan for the future. If you are a student, you can’t plan for the “normal” future. If you are a worker, you can’t plan for the future. You can’t even plan for the present. Because the present is being rewritten every day by the actions of this leader. It’s like the U.S. government is being run not by a person, but by a group of people in a room who are randomly selecting and reassigning tasks every 30 minutes. The only thing that is constant is the uncertainty. And the only thing that is more constant than uncertainty is the fear that the uncertainty is going to become reality.
The author is saying that uncertainty is a problem for all of us, and the problem is not just the uncertainty, but that it is caused by a leader who is ignorant, vengeful, and unpredictable. The author is worried that the U.S. government is being run like a group of people who randomly assign tasks every 30 minutes.

Paul Krugman,"A Balance of Payments Primer, Part I.txt","Modern economics was born in Edinburgh, Scotland in the 18th century. You may think I’m talking about Adam Smith and The Wealth of Nations, published in 1776. But while I certainly don’t want to minimize that book’s influence, the fact is that the first exposition of something that today’s economists recognize as a model came some years earlier. It was an essay, “Of the balance of trade,” published in 1752 by Smith’s friend, the philosopher David Hume,
At that time international trade policy was dominated by “mercantilism” — the belief that trade deficits were bad because they drained deficit countries of gold and silver, which accrued to surplus countries. In an era in which transactions were made using gold and silver coins, there was a widespread fear that a country could literally run out of money. Hence trade deficits could be disastrous. Hume, on the other hand, urged everyone to chill. OK, that wasn’t exactly the language he used. Yet his reasoning was quite chill: according to Hume, a government concerned about trade deficits “may safely trust to the course of human affairs, without fear or jealousy.” Decades before Smith introduced the phrase “invisible hand”, Hume argued that trade imbalances would be self-correcting. In other words, persistent trade deficits would eventually be remedied by market forces. You can read about his argument here. World trade has changed radically since 1752. We don’t use metallic money to make transactions anymore. Moreover, nations now engage in extensive, large-scale trade in physical and financial assets as well as goods. As a result, persistent capital inflows — that is, inflows of funds from residents of other nations who are investing in your country – have led in some cases to persistent trade deficits. This has been true for the United States since 1980. As examples of these capital inflows, think of European, Japanese and Korean automakers who have invested in manufacturing plants in the U.S. Or Chinese buyers of U.S. government bonds. But despite the vast changes in the world economy, Hume’s admonition against being obsessed with trade deficits or the balance of payments in general is still good advice. Yet in America we now have a president who is obsessed with trade imbalances, and his administration has found economists willing to provide arguments to indulge that obsession. I made the case a few days ago that no one should believe that these economists have any real influence. Their arguments are being used the way a drunkard uses a lamppost, for support rather than illumination. Still, those arguments are out there, and a number of readers have asked me to provide a balance of payments primer, both for general understanding and to give a sense of where there is room for rational disagreement. I was going to talk about the role of the dollar as a reserve currency, and how that plays into the story.","But this post was already getting too long and intricate, so that will have to be a follow-up post, probably next weekend. Beyond the paywall I’ll discuss the following: 1. How the balance of payments works, and why net capital inflows necessarily imply trade deficits 2. How America became a deficit nation Balance of payments essentials All economic transactions involve someone exchanging an asset for something else — in effect someone sells an asset in return for a good, a service, or another asset. You may say that we normally buy things with money — but money, which in the modern world usually consists not of physical currency but of ones and zeroes on a server somewhere, is just a kind of asset. Say I want to buy a Tesla. If I take out a loan to buy a Tesla, I am selling an asset — my loan which is an asset owned by the car loan company — in exchange for a car. If I withdraw funds from my money market account to buy Tesla stock, I’m selling one asset to purchase another asset. In both scenarios, every purchase by me is also a sale by the seller. It’s just accounting. I personally wouldn’t do either of these things. Elon Musk is reportedly talking about getting into the restaurant business, and I’m already hearing jokes about the Cyberburger, which randomly falls apart or bursts into flame. But you get the idea. The same principle applies to the transactions a nation does with the rest of the world. Or as we sometimes say, the balance of payments always balances. Every purchase by one country is also a sale for another country, regardless of the form of the exchange. It could be (1) goods and services exchanged for goods and services; or (2) goods and services exchanged for assets; or (3) assets exchanged for assets. The form doesn’t matter: every purchase involves a corresponding sale. So for the nation as a whole, we have an accounting identity for international transactions: Sales of domestic goods and services to foreigners + Sales of domestic assets to foreigners = Domestic purchases of foreign goods and services + Domestic purchases of foreign assets If we took a highly simplified example, in which the only two countries in the world are the U.S. and China, we might say that: Sales of US wheat to China + Sales of US Treasury bills to China = US purchases of Shein clothing + US purchases of Chinese stocks OK, writing “goods and services” over and over again would get tedious, so from now on I’m just going to write “goods” with the “and services” implied unless otherwise specified. Also, “services” should be understood to include things like interest payments and dividends, which are in effect payments for the use of someone else’s capital. With this language simplification, we can rearrange the accounting identity of international transactions to arrive at this: Sales of assets – Purchases of assets = Purchases","But I’ve decided to start with a basic explanation of what the balance of payments is. I think that is the right place to start. So, let me begin by defining the balance of payments (BOP) as the record of all economic transactions between a country and the rest of the world. That is, the BOP is a record of all the transactions that a country has with the rest of the world. It is not the same as the balance of trade, which is the difference between the value of a country’s exports and imports of goods and services. The BOP is made up of two parts: the current account and the capital account. The current account records the value of a country’s exports and imports of goods and services, as well as net income from investments and net transfers. The capital account records the movement of money into and out of a country. The balance of payments is the sum of the current account and the capital account. The current account is the most important part of the BOP, and it is usually the part that people focus on when they talk about the balance of payments. The current account includes the trade balance (goods and services), the income balance (earnings from investments), and the transfers balance (gifts and remittances). The capital account includes the capital inflows and outflows, such as foreign direct investment, portfolio investment, and other financial transactions. Now, the current account is the most important part of the BOP, and it is usually the part that people focus on when they talk about the balance of payments. The current account is the part of the BOP that is used to assess a country’s economic health. A current account deficit means that a country is importing more goods and services than it is exporting. In other words, the country is spending more on foreign goods and services than it is earning from its exports. A current account surplus means that a country is exporting more than it is importing, so it is earning more",481,500,348,0.1106,0.1222,0.976,0.9444,0.8082,0.8452,4.1522,3.2059,0.2944,0.2608,0.0408,0.0484,0.0081,0.0167,0.495,0.4022,0.9728,0.9353,0.4036036036036036,0.39168110918544197,0.48860759493670886,6,8,0.9803,0.9629,0.12474012474012475,0.116,0.11206896551724138,0.7541,0.5057,29-05-2025
Paul Krugman,Crypto Is Still for Criming.txt,"Yesterday “the president” announced a trade “deal” with “Britain.” IN CASE YOU’RE WONDERING, I’M TRYING TO EMULATE TRUMP’S STYLE, WITH RANDOM QUOTATION MARKS AND BLOCK CAPITALS, PLUS EXCLAMATION POINTS AT WEIRD PLACES! Anyway, as I predicted yesterday, it was indeed a “deal” as opposed to an actual deal. There was very little substantive content. The 10 percent overall tariff on imports from Britain remained, although extra tariffs on British steel and cars were removed. Hey, children only need two dolls and five pencils, but the wealthy need their Rolls Royces, Jaguars and Bentleys. Britain, for its part, made vague promises to increase access for some U.S. agricultural products, and may be buying some Boeing jets. Claims of a major deal were, in short, fake news. This was all about creating the illusion that Trump’s tariffs are accomplishing something. Meanwhile, however, something potentially important happened in Congress. A bill that would have helped expand the use of stablecoins — cryptocurrencies that, unlike Bitcoin and other early entrants, are supposed to have a fixed value in dollars — stalled in the Senate. To advance, the GENIUS Act (gag) needed 60 votes on a procedural measure. With every Democrat and 3 Republicans voting no, it only got 48 votes. What happened? Republicans tried to ram through a bill that literally had no text. That was too much even for crypto-friendly Democrats. The setback for Republicans also reflected the stench of Trumpist corruption that increasingly hangs over all things crypto. The $Trump and $Melania memecoins have been used for what amounts to brazen bribery. So has USD1, the stablecoin recently introduced by World Liberty Financial, the Trump family crypto firm. It’s hard to overstate how big a deal this is. Thanks to crypto, the president of the United States is now effectively for sale, and the buyers appear to include not just wealthy foreigners but foreign governments. We’re talking billions of dollars in direct payments to the president and his relatives. If we were still a serious country, Trump’s crypto corruption would lead to his immediate impeachment and removal from office. Crypto has also been used to scam naïve Trump loyalists. An investigative report by the Washington Post found that while a handful of large investors made a lot of money from $Trump, tens of thousands of small investors, lured in by the Trump name, bought the coin near its peak and have seen most of their money vanish. It’s understandable, then, that Democrats have been reluctant to go along with the Republican bum’s rush on crypto, worried that a vote in favor might be seen both as giving Trump a win and as tacit approval for Trump’s profiteering. However, most observers seem to believe that the bill will nonetheless advance next week after some cosmetic changes that will offer pro-crypto Democrats a fig leaf, a chance to claim that they had taken a stand against corruption.","So it’s important to say that whatever the final language on the bill says, it will still be enabling corruption. Why? Because the entire crypto enterprise is corrupt. Money-laundering and scams that exploit naïve investors aren’t unfortunate behavior that taints a potentially useful enterprise. For crypto, they are the whole game, more or less the only reason cryptocurrencies exist. That may sound like an extreme statement, but you should bear in mind that Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, was created in 2008. That makes cryptocurrency ancient by tech standards — not much younger than the iPhone, much older than Apple Pay. Ever since crypto’s invention, enthusiasts have promised that blockchain tokens will find widespread legal use cases, displacing conventional means of payment, any day now. But it keeps not happening. At this point, 17 years after crypto arrived on the scene, there are still no — I repeat, no — significant legal use cases. This is despite many efforts to make crypto a real medium of exchange. Most notably, El Salvador’s government made a big push to turn Bitcoin into the country’s effective currency, making taxes payable in Bitcoin, subsidizing people’s digital wallets and pushing businesses to accept Bitcoin for purchases. The attempt was a complete bust, and El Salvador, which dreamed of becoming a hive of crypto-investment and crypto-tourism, has gone into the rent-a-Gulag business instead. But if crypto has no legitimate uses, why are crypto assets worth more than $3 trillion? Well, the marketing of crypto has been brilliant, with many small investors in particular still being sucked in by the combination of technobabble and libertarian derp. Promotion of crypto by legitimate enterprises, which profit from crypto sales, has been relentless. Venmo is a digital payment system that actually works and is in widespread use — even the fruit and vegetable stand around the corner from me takes it. But every time I use Venmo it tries to sell me crypto: And while crypto has failed to find legitimate uses, it has flourished as a vehicle for illegitimate uses: extortion, money-laundering and, as we’ve seen, bribes to politicians. Finally, crypto has in effect bought itself huge political influence. This influence-buying is, alas, bipartisan. As far as I know, none of the pro-crypto Democrats who will probably put the GENIUS Act over the top next week is personally on the take the way Trump is. But they wouldn’t be sympathetic to a fundamentally fraudulent industry if it weren’t for the large campaign contributions that come from defending the Big Scam. So this is a plea to those Democrats: Please rethink your position. Crypto isn’t a legitimate industry. Any vote that further empowers that industry is a vote for more and bigger corruption, even if you personally aren’t corrupt. Just say no to the scam. MUSICAL CODA In other news:","But even that seems unlikely. The Senate is in a very weird state. The Republicans are not even trying to be reasonable. They are trying to be absurd. They want to make a bill that has no text, and then pass it as if it were a real bill. They are not even trying to be absurd. They are trying to be literal. If you’re a Republican and you want to pass a bill, you need to have a bill. You need to have a text.

Paul Krugman,Cruel and Usual_ Republicans Prepare to Gut Medicaid.txt,"West Virginia is a very red state; Donald Trump received more than two thirds of its votes last year. It’s also a poor state, left behind by the 21st century economy. Because incomes are low, it pays very little in federal income taxes — less per household than any other state. However, at least the great majority of West Virginians — more than 94 percent — have health insurance. The reason for this good news is that unlike many red states, WV accepted Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, which was passed in 2010 but didn’t fully go into effect until 2014. The effect was dramatic; Medicaid now covers more than a quarter of the state’s population:
Source: KFF
And Medicaid covers 45 percent of the state’s children. But now the Republicans West Virginia helped put in power are preparing to impose savage cuts on a program that has literally been a lifeline for many in the state, in order to help offset the cost of huge tax cuts for high-income Americans, hardly any of which will trickle down to WV voters. Populism! We’ll be hearing a lot of lies about Medicaid in the weeks ahead, starting with Trump’s arithmetically impossible claim last week that Medicaid won’t be “touched” by the planned spending cuts. So here are two things you should know about a program Trump and his allies have in their crosshairs: it’s extremely important to many Americans, and it’s much more cost-efficient than the rest of our health care system. Medicaid is really, really important
I often encounter generally well-informed people who are surprised to learn that Medicaid is a much bigger program, in terms of the number of people covered, than Medicare — 69 million versus 48 million. The perception that Medicare is much more important may reflect the fact that Medicaid still costs taxpayers less than Medicare. This is partly because older people have higher health costs than the young adults and children who make up much of the Medicaid population. But it’s also because Medicaid is quite cost-efficient; more about that shortly. There’s also, let’s be frank, a perception that Medicaid is politically unimportant, that conservatives can safely target it for cuts, because it’s mainly a program for inner city people of color. But that was never as true as people imagined and is definitely not true now. Again, consider West Virginia. It’s one of America’s most rural states and overwhelmingly — 90 percent — white. Yet as we’ve seen, it’s deeply dependent on Medicaid. In fact, Medicaid is especially important for rural and small-town Americans, even if they aren’t beneficiaries themselves, because it helps keep health care accessible. Hospitals have been closing across much of rural America, because there aren’t enough paying patients to keep them operating; the picture at the top of this post shows one such hospital, in Cuthbert, Georgia.","Georgia is one of the states that, unlike West Virginia, refused to accept a federally-funded expansion in Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. As a result, fewer Georgians are able to pay for medical care. Rural hospital closures have been overwhelmingly concentrated in these “non-expansion” states. All in all, if Republicans think they can slash Medicaid without paying a heavy political price, because only Those People will be hurt, they’re going to be mightily surprised. According to one recent poll, 71 percent of Trump voters say that cutting Medicaid would be unacceptable. Medicaid is cost-efficient Some conservatives claim that we can achieve big cuts in Medicaid outlays by eliminating wasteful spending, because that’s their rote line. And there’s surely some waste in Medicaid, as there is in any large program. But there is nothing comparable to the massive overpayments Medicare makes to insurance companies selling Medicare Advantage plans. Funny how that never comes up in conservative diatribes against waste, fraud and abuse. In fact, compared with other parts of the U.S. health care system, Medicaid stands out for its remarkably low costs. Making comparisons among different types of insurance coverage can be a bit tricky, because the populations are different; for example, people in poor health often have low incomes, and hence qualify for Medicaid. But careful comparisons that adjust for these differences find that Medicaid is a lot cheaper than private health insurance: How does Medicaid manage this? It has lower administrative costs than private insurance, in part because it doesn’t have to devote resources to marketing, determining eligibility, denying coverage, and so on. It also pays providers less, which can sound like a bad thing until you realize that this includes things like bargaining for lower prices on drugs and medical equipment. I’m not an expert here, but my understanding is that Medicaid, as a program for low-income Americans, has something that, for different reasons, neither Medicare nor private insurers have: The ability to say no. No, we won’t pay for that expensive drug being advertised on TV when there’s a much cheaper alternative that’s equally effective, or close to it. No, we won’t pay inflated prices for medical procedures of dubious effectiveness. And the ability to, say, exclude overpriced drugs from Medicaid’s formulary unless the pharma company cuts its price gives Medicaid a lot of bargaining power. Does this low cost lead to low-quality coverage? Medicaid recipients may sometimes have trouble finding a doctor, because of those lower payments. Yet according to patients themselves, Medicaid does fine — Americans on Medicaid are roughly as satisfied with their coverage as those with employer-sponsored insurance: Source: KFF Furthermore, those in poor health, who need health coverage most, appear to be significantly more satisfied if they get their coverage from Medicaid than those getting insurance through their employer: Source: KFF All in all, if you were looking for a way to reduce America’s extremely high health care costs without reducing the quality of care, Medicaid actually looks like a model","Medicaid is the reason why that hospital is still open. The article continues: The second reason to care about Medicaid is that it’s far more cost-efficient than the rest of our health care system. Let’s look at the numbers. According to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the average cost per person in 2014 for Medicare was $80,533. For Medicaid, the average was $31,779. That’s a big difference. But this is not the full story. The average cost per person is not the only thing that matters. The cost per person who is eligible for the program is more important. For Medicare, the average cost per person is $80,533. But only 25 percent of people in the United States are eligible for Medicare. For Medicaid, the average cost per person is $31,779, but 17 percent of the U.S. population is eligible. So when you take into account the population sizes, the real average cost per person is about $30,000 for Medicaid and $163,000 for Medicare. So, the cost efficiency is clear. So, the second point is: Medicaid is much more cost-efficient than the rest of our health care system. This is a big deal. The United States spends a lot more on health care than other countries, and it’s not because of the cost of care — that’s not the problem — but because of the cost of delivery, which is mostly the problem of our health care system. So, Medicaid is a good thing. It’s important. It’s cost-efficient. So, the next time someone tries to attack Medicaid, remember these two things. First, it’s important to many Americans. Second, it’s much more cost-efficient than the rest of our health care system. This is a huge deal, and it’s a big reason why the Affordable Care",479,500,297,0.4193,0.3284,0.9762,0.945,0.9498,0.5135,-1.1884,-11.5128,0.3955,0.3882,0.0457,0.0946,0.0071,0.0413,0.6835,0.4782,0.9656,0.955,0.3929824561403509,0.3843537414965986,0.4207650273224044,8,7,0.9741,0.9757,0.11899791231732777,0.144,0.18518518518518517,0.8862,0.6034,29-05-2025
Paul Krugman,"Lies, Damned Lies and Trumpflation.txt","If a pandemic breaks out, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, on orders from the White House, refuse to publish data on its spread, will it still kill people? Yes, of course. And that’s why I would be very cautious about buying TIPS — Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities. I’ll explain the apparent non sequitur later. First, let me note that concerns about suppressed data on infectious disease aren’t hypothetical. We currently have a major outbreak of bird flu, with serious concerns that it may already have spread to humans. Normally we’d be learning about the evolving risks from the CDC’s flagship research publication, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. But Donald Trump’s appointees have politicized the historically independent report, telling it what and what not to cover. And the agency is already suppressing reports on bird flu. OK, I am not an expert on epidemiology, although I’ve heard enough from people who are to be very nervous. I remember Trump’s initial response to Covid, in which he showed no interest in trying to control the disease but was very eager to hold down the reported numbers — and he has much more power to suppress bad news this time around. But while I’m not an epidemiologist, I do know something about inflation. And I’m getting very worried, not so much about the next few months as about what will happen a year or two down the road. Wednesday’s report on consumer prices came in hot, although Thursday’s report on producer prices was more encouraging. And the Fed focuses on yet a third measure, which the people I follow expect to come in fairly benign. Monthly data are volatile, so you shouldn’t overreact to any of this. And it’s too soon to give Trump either blame or credit. But inflation has been sticky enough that the Federal Reserve isn’t likely to cut interest rates soon, if at all, a problem for Trump, who demanded rate cuts just hours before that consumer price report:
Interest Rates should be lowered, something which would go hand in hand with upcoming Tariffs!!! Lets Rock and Roll, America!!! Beyond that, during the campaign Trump didn’t just promise to reduce inflation; he promised that he would bring prices down. In August, standing in front of a table of packaged goods, he declared
Grocery prices have skyrocketed. When I win, I will immediately bring prices down, starting on day one. Well, things aren’t looking good on that front:
And almost everything Trump is doing or threatening to do to the economy will cause higher, not lower inflation. I don’t know what if anything is going on in his mind when he asserts that tariffs will reduce prices, but tariffs are in fact sales taxes on imported goods, and does anyone think that sales taxes make stuff cheaper? Then there are plans to deport large numbers of immigrants. Trump is reportedly angry that deportations aren’t moving faster and has reassigned top officials at Immigration and Customs Enforcement.","If he manages to pressure them into rushing things and we see large-scale roundups of immigrants — I’m not specifying illegal immigrants, because a rushed, pressured effort is likely to sweep up many legal immigrants too — the economic impact could be devastating. Grocery prices would be hit especially hard, because both agriculture and food processing, especially meatpacking, rely on immigrants for much of their work forces. The one piece of Trump’s economic agenda that at least sounds as if it could reduce inflation is his promise to increase energy production, presumably by eliminating environmental regulations so that fossil fuel companies can “Drill, baby, drill!” So let’s talk about why that won’t work. Basically, any large decline in energy prices would lead to a fall in production, driving prices right back up. In today’s world, U.S. shale oil drillers are the marginal producers — the producers whose decisions set both a floor and a ceiling on overall oil prices. As I write this, the benchmark price of U.S. crude oil — the West Texas Intermediate price — is just over $70 a barrel. And here’s the thing: any substantial decline in prices from this point would make drilling new wells unprofitable in many U.S. oilfields: This doesn’t mean that production would stagnate; it would decline, as older fields get exhausted. So even if you believe, wrongly, that regulation is a major barrier to energy production, there’s no way Trump can engineer a major decline in prices. Trump, then, obviously won’t deliver on his promise to reduce prices, which was never credible. He won’t even reduce inflation — the rate at which prices are rising. Instead, it seems highly likely that inflation will rise on his watch. This in turn means that the Fed won’t cut interest rates, as he has been demanding, and may even raise them if the inflation picture gets ugly enough. What happens then? Right now the Fed is a quasi-independent institution run by technocrats, who set interest rates based on their assessment of what the economy needs rather than taking instructions from the executive branch. But Fed independence rests on political norms rather than any strong legal foundation. Given the fact that Trump has already shut down USAID, a blatantly illegal move, and effectively shuttered the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which also looks illegal, it’s surely possible that he can find a way to force the Fed to cut interest rates even in the face of rising inflation. Critics will point to the example of Turkey, whose authoritarian leader, like Trump, insisted that rates should go down, not up, in the face of rising inflation; the Erdogan regime didn’t reverse course until inflation was above 80 percent. But Trump surely won’t listen. There’s also another thing populist regimes do when inflation runs hot: lie about it. While Trump isn’t a “populist” in the sense of caring about the working class, he does have a populist-style disdain for expertise. And one way to deal with bad economic","That’s not going to help with the inflation problem. Deporting immigrants, who are working in the U.S. and paying taxes, is going to make the problem worse. Also, the new immigration law is going to make it harder to get jobs, which will make it harder to afford things, which will make it harder to afford things. So, if you’re trying to reduce inflation, that’s not the way to go.
Trump’s policies are not going to solve the inflation problem, but they might make it worse. And even if the Fed does eventually cut rates, the Fed is not going to be doing it in response to Trump’s policies, but in response to the underlying inflation, which is going to be higher than it would be otherwise. So the Fed will be cutting rates in response to higher inflation, not lower. So that’s a problem for Trump. Because when the Fed cuts rates, it will be to stimulate the economy, not to reduce inflation. So even if the Fed cuts rates, it won’t help Trump’s cause.
In short, Trump is trying to solve the inflation problem with policies that make it worse. And the Fed is not going to help Trump by cutting rates, because the underlying inflation is higher. So the whole thing is a mess.
So, in the end, the conclusion is that the real problem is inflation, not the pandemic. The pandemic is a problem, but it’s not the main issue. The main issue is inflation. And the problem with the CDC is that they are not being independent. That is why I would be cautious about buying TIPS. TIPS are inflation-linked bonds. So if inflation is higher than expected, the principal of the bond increases, and the interest paid is based on the increased principal. So if inflation is higher, the bond is more valuable. But if inflation is lower than expected, the principal is reduced, and the interest is based on the reduced principal. So TIPS are a good hedge",499,500,335,0.2538,0.2396,0.9781,0.9205,0.9268,0.696,-1.456,-6.0446,0.3368,0.3524,0.0296,0.0419,0.0039,0.0082,0.2293,0.2561,0.9732,0.9359,0.4193011647254576,0.37080536912751677,0.4688279301745636,9,6,0.9895,0.9778,0.13026052104208416,0.136,0.15223880597014924,0.9809,0.5106,29-05-2025
Paul Krugman,The Trade War Isn’t Over.txt,"Monday morning I woke up to an urgent text from Robin, who is still visiting friends in Europe: “You have to look at the news NOW.” Sure enough, Donald Trump had suddenly slashed his tariff on China from 145 percent to 30 percent. But much of the reporting I’ve seen on this climbdown has been deeply misleading. If you get your picture of what’s happening from “news analyses” rather than experts who actually do the math, you might well think that the Trump trade war is basically over, that we’re back to more or less normal policy. The reality is that we’ve gone from a completely insane tariff rate on imports from China to a rate that’s merely crazy. And China accounts for only a fraction of our imports. Tariffs on everyone else are still at 10 percent, a level we haven’t seen in generations. And there are still other shoes to drop: Trump has, for example, been promising tariffs on pharmaceuticals. The trade war is still very much on. Anyone who reports otherwise (a) hasn’t done their homework (b) is misleading the public. And while the stock market has to some extent bought into unwarranted optimism, markets with fewer naive investors like oil and bonds don’t seem fooled. Look first at the average tariff rate. Here’s a chart from the Yale Budget Lab:
If you’re puzzled, the “pre-substitution” rate is currently announced tariffs applied to actual imports, which now stands at 17.8 percent — which is immense. The “post-substitution” takes into account the fact that China, which is still facing a very high tariff, will soon supply a smaller share of our imports, and is “merely” 16.4 percent. We’re still looking at overall tariffs not much lower than the rate after the infamous Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930. And bear in mind that Smoot-Hawley added to tariff rates that were already high, while this time we’re jumping from very low to very high tariffs almost instantly. Also, trade is far more important to the U.S. economy now than it was in 1930:
So even after Trump’s “climbdown” we’re still looking at a shock to the economy 7 or 8 times as big as Smoot-Hawley, the previous poster child for destructive tariff policy. What will this shock do to international trade? Tariffs raise the price of imports (even if Trump insists otherwise), and higher prices reduce demand. So tariffs will lead to lower imports. How much lower? The answer depends on the elasticity of demand — the percentage fall in imports for every one percent increase in their price. Economists try to estimate this number by looking at how transportation costs affect the volume of trade between any two countries. There’s a range of estimates, but let me go with 4, which is actually on the lower end. Given this number, we’d expect Trump’s tariffs after last weekend’s retreat on China to cut overall U.S. trade by roughly 50 percent.","Trade with China, which would have been virtually eliminated with a 145 percent tariff rate, would fall by “only” around 65 percent with a 30 percent tariff. Does cutting U.S. trade with the world in general by half and reducing trade with China by two thirds sound to you like Trump calling off his trade war? It sounds to me like a massive disruption of the world economy, only slightly less disruptive than what we were looking at last week. What about the impact on U.S. families? Tariffs are sales taxes levied on American households; don’t let anyone tell you different. Walmart declared yesterday that it will have to begin raising prices later this month because of the tariffs. And tariffs are regressive sales taxes that fall much more heavily on lower-income Americans than on the affluent, for three reasons. First, low-income households spend a higher fraction of their income. Second, compared with the affluent, poor and working-class families spend more on goods, which are facing tariffs, as opposed to services, which aren’t. Finally, the goods whose prices will rise most tend to be items like clothing that loom large in lower-income families’ budgets. The Budget Lab has estimated the effects of the new tariff plan on households’ purchasing power at different levels. This is a huge hit to real incomes in the lower parts of the income distribution: Two further points about where we are right now on tariffs. First, nothing that has been announced is any kind of lasting commitment. Everything is at most an announcement about what tariff rates will be for the next 90 days. Nobody, very much including Trump himself, knows what policy will be a few months from now. We’re still living with huge uncertainty, which means an environment in which it’s impossible for businesses to make long-term plans. Second, everything Trump is still doing on tariffs is a violation of longstanding international agreements. You may think you’ve made a deal with America, but U.S. officials treat solemn deals like suggestions at best. In other words, not much has changed since last week. We may not be looking at the complete economic meltdown that seemed quite possible (and is still a possibility), but we’re still looking at much higher inflation and an economic slowdown at best — i.e., stagflation. The interesting question, as I see it, is why so many pundits and reporters — and, it seems, small stock investors — have been sounding the all clear on Trump’s tariffs, when the reality is that all we’ve seen is a modest retreat from complete, destructive insanity to seriously harmful madness. It’s hard to avoid the sense that what we’re seeing on tariffs is another version of the sanewashing that Trump has benefited from ever since he entered politics. People just keep wanting to believe that he’s making sense, that he isn’t as ignorant and irresponsible as he seems. But he is. MUSICAL CODA","That is, if we were importing, say, $100 billion in goods from China, we’d be importing only $50 billion after the tariff. But that’s not the only effect. There’s also the effect of the tariff on the domestic market. If the tariff is high enough, it can cause domestic prices to rise. For example, if a country imposes a 100 percent tariff on a good, the domestic price will rise by 100 percent. So with the new 30 percent tariff on China, the domestic price of Chinese goods would be 30 percent higher than before. But in the U.S., which is a large country, the tariff will have a more complex effect. The U.S. is a big market, and the tariff may lead to a decrease in imports, but also an increase in exports, because of the “tariff effect” on the domestic price. So, for example, if the U.S. imposes a tariff on Chinese goods, the domestic price of Chinese goods rises. That will make U.S. goods cheaper relative to Chinese goods. So the U.S. may export more to China. But this is a very small effect, because the U.S. is already a large net exporter, and China is a relatively small market. So, overall, the tariff effect is small. But the overall effect of the tariff is big — the overall trade effect is about 50 percent, and the domestic price effect is about 30 percent. So the total is about 80 percent. That is, if we were importing $100 billion in Chinese goods, we’d be importing only $20 billion, and the domestic price of those goods would be 30 percent higher. So, even if you don’t like the idea of a trade war, the overall effect is still massive. But the problem is, we have not just one tariff. We have many tariffs, and they",489,489,307,0.3602,0.2491,0.9506,0.9442,0.9266,0.6167,-1.217,-6.3548,0.394,0.3558,0.0484,0.0453,0.0087,0.0013,0.6633,0.5104,0.9833,0.9588,0.4,0.40734265734265734,0.43089430894308944,7,5,0.985,0.967,0.13496932515337423,0.1390593047034765,0.18892508143322476,0.9351,0.5782,29-05-2025
Paul Krugman,Did Peter Navarro Save Democracy_.txt,"Just a few short weeks ago the prospects for American democracy looked bleak. Donald Trump was elected despite the events of January 6th and his clear threats of retribution against those who had tried to hold him in check. The powerful and extremely wealthy lined up behind him on the inauguration dais and contributed vast sums to his inauguration party. Democrats were stunned, despondent and disorganized. The stock market was climbing. And many of us expected Trump, the ultimate nepo baby, to claim that the solid economy he inherited from Biden was his own handiwork. Suddenly the march to authoritarian rule is looking much less unstoppable. Trump’s vindictive over-reach has quickly sparked widespread outrage within many institutions, including universities and the courts, and among regular Americans. Polls suggest that the public is making a hard turn against Trump’s tactics. Moreover, the economy, which was arguably the decisive issue in November, has rapidly turned into a huge Trump liability. It’s actually incredible how fast public views of the economy have soured:
Source: San Francisco Fed
Just to be clear, I am very much not in the camp that urges Democrats to focus on kitchen-table issues and ignore the Trump regime’s other outrages. Polls tell us that Americans aren’t as ignorant and self-centered as some political consultants would have their clients believe. Many ordinary people are outraged at the news of renditions of legal residents to gulags in El Salvador. The public overwhelmingly opposes Trumpist defunding of medical research and attacks on universities, as well as the DOGEing of Social Security. Democrats shouldn’t give Trump a pass on any of his destructive actions. They should, instead, tell voters that stripping people of their civil rights, annihilating education and science, destroying U.S. trade and poisoning our international relationships has one unifying goal: to destroy civil society in the name of MAGA. That said, I believe that the administration’s metastasizing economic catasrophe is a critical development. As I read the history of successful autogolpes, politicians who win an election and then effectively destroy the democracy that elevated them, it is almost always the case that their consolidation of power rests upon the perception of economic achievement. Take the case of Hitler. And spare me the fake outrage: We’re well past the point where you can say that MAGA/Nazi comparisons are illegitimate. Many people are probably aware that the Nazi takeover of Germany was made possible by the collapse of the German economy between 1929 and 1933 — a slide into deep depression that was partly due to the Brüning government’s refusal to depart from gold-standard orthodoxy. But I’m not sure how many realize that Hitler was able to consolidate power in part because his heterodox economic policies led to a strong recovery and a rapid fall in unemployment, shown at the top of this post. Somewhat similarly, Viktor Orban took power in Hungary during the euro crisis, which led to high unemployment and painful austerity imposed by the International Monetary Fund.","He was able to consolidate one-party rule in Hungary in part because he ended up presiding over a long period of economic recovery: Orban doesn’t deserve much credit for that recovery. Large-scale aid from the European Union, which shamefully continued long after Hungary had effectively become a dictatorship, was surely a bigger factor than Orban’s policies. So was foreign investment, especially by German car companies. In any case, however, the improving economy surely helped reconcile Hungarians to his rule. Trump is in a very different position. He inherited an economy that, whatever Trumpists claim, was in quite good shape. Inflation and unemployment were both low, while real wages — especially for less well-paid workers — were up substantially. U.S. voters elected Trump anyway. But as of January 20 the U.S. economy had far more room to get worse than it did to get better. And it is indeed getting worse, with remarkable speed. The insane tariff plan Trump announced on April 2 — which appears to have been devised by Peter Navarro, his trade czar — was a huge shock to the system. The different but equally insane plan he announced a week later was no better. The 145 percent tariff on China seems set to create supply-chain disruptions comparable to those caused by Covid: We will almost surely see dramatic price increases and empty shelves within weeks, along with the failure of many small businesses that depend on imports, trucking companies and more. A recession later this year looks more likely than not. And there are more shoes to drop: Wait until Social Security starts failing thanks to inadequate staffing and the public becomes aware of the savage Medicaid cuts that are central to G.O.P. budget plans. Trump and his minions will try to blame other people for their woes, claiming falsely that the Biden economy was terrible and/or that it’s all Jerome Powell’s fault. But I don’t think their whining will play with most Americans. It’s a good bet that Trump’s approval numbers, which have already plunged, will go even lower. Does any of this matter in the face of an authoritarian movement that already controls most of the levers of power? Yes, it does. Trump can’t, unfortunately, be removed from office no matter how badly he performs. But people who might have stood aside as he dismantled democracy if he were delivering prosperity will be more inclined to take a stand because he’s failing as an economic manager. It's much too soon to predict that U.S. democracy will survive. But Trump and his economic advisers, by screwing up so completely, have given us a chance. Thank you, Peter Navarro. MUSICAL CODA","His government, however, managed to create a strong recovery, which led to the collapse of the opposition and the consolidation of power. The same pattern has been repeated in other countries. In fact, the same thing is happening in the U.S. right now. The Trump administration has managed to create a strong economic recovery, with unemployment falling from 6.6% in the beginning of 2020 to 3.6% in the beginning of 2022, and the stock market is up 21% since then. This recovery has made it possible for Trump to consolidate his power, but the recovery has also made it possible for the economy to become a problem for Trump. That is, the economy is now a liability for him. The key is that the economy is not just a recovery, but a recovery that has been achieved in the context of a series of other policies that have damaged the social contract. The economy is a problem not because it’s doing well, but because it is doing well in the context of the Trump policies. The recovery is a problem because it is a recovery that has been achieved through the destruction of the social contract. So, for the first time, the economy is actually a problem for Trump. This is the real turning point for the U.S. and for American democracy. It is the first time that the economy, which was the central issue in the 2020 election, is becoming a liability for Trump. The economy is now a liability for him. The economy is the first problem that is actually a problem for him. That is the key to understanding the current moment. In the end, the economy is a problem because the economy is doing well in the context of Trump policies that have done damage to the social contract. So, the question becomes: how do we make sure that the economy is not a problem for Trump?

Paul Krugman,Our Government Is Experiencing a Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly.txt,"Last month SpaceX carried out a test launch of its in-development Starship rocket. Liftoff was achieved, but as the company later announced, “Starship experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly during its ascent burn.” In other words, it exploded. It would be wrong to think of this explosion as a disaster; new products often experience failures during testing. That is, after all, why we test them. Still, the euphemistic language reeks of unwillingness to take responsibility and admit that things didn’t go as planned. But then again, what would you expect from a company owned by Elon Musk? And here’s the thing: If a rocket blows up, you can build a new rocket and try again. “Move fast and break things” is sometimes an OK approach if the things in question are just hardware, which can be replaced. But what if the object that experiences “rapid unscheduled disassembly” is something whose continued functioning is crucial to people’s lives — say, something like the U.S. government? This isn’t a hypothetical question: Musk, with backing from Donald Trump, is blowing up significant parts of the U.S. government as you read this. And we can already see the shape of multiple potential disasters. The Muskenjugend — the mostly very young people Musk has hired to work at the Department of Government Efficiency, which isn’t actually a government department in any legal sense but which Trump has effectively given huge and probably unconstitutional power to remake federal agencies — generally seem to share three characteristics. First, they all seem to be extreme right-wing ideologues: whenever journalists investigate the social media trail of one of Musk’s operatives, what they find is horrifying. For example, Marko Elez, who had access to the Treasury Department’s central payments system, had in the recent past advocated racism and eugenics. Second, they don’t know anything about the government agencies they’re supposedly going to make more efficient. That’s understandable. The federal government has around 2 million workers, many — I would say the vast majority — performing important public services, in a huge variety of fields. You can’t parachute into a government agency and expect to know in a matter of days which if any programs and employees are dispensable. But the third characteristic of the Muskenjugend is that, like Musk himself, they’re arrogant. They believe that they can parachute into agencies and quickly identify what should be cut. So last week, when the Trump administration began laying off large numbers of probationary workers, the only real questions were how quickly it would become clear that essential government functions were being compromised and just how scary the damage would be. And the answers were that the damage became obvious almost immediately, and some of it looks very scary indeed. A word about language: the term “probationary workers” can sound as if we’re talking about problem cases, people who’ve had poor performance reviews or something.","But all it means is employees who were hired relatively recently, usually within the past year, and as a result have weaker job protection than their more senior colleagues. So what would be your worst nightmare about large, hastily announced job cuts? Maybe firing the people responsible for keeping our nuclear weapons secure? Sure enough, on Thursday night, according to CNN’s reporting, Trump officials fired more than 300 staffers at the National Nuclear Security Administration, apparently unaware that this agency oversees America’s nukes. (Maybe the name should have been a giveaway?) The next day, realizing the enormity of the error, the agency tried to reinstate those workers — but was having trouble getting in touch, because the terminated workers had already been locked out of their government email accounts. Trump officials also summarily fired 3400 workers at the National Forest Service, which plays a critical role in fighting forest fires. The administration said that no firefighters were laid off, but right now — before fire season begins — is when the service should be trying to prevent fires by, among other things, clearing vegetation that can feed those fires. That work has now been hobbled, in some cases brought to a complete halt. (Remember when Trump blamed California for devastating fires, claiming that the state hadn’t raked enough leaves?) There have been large layoffs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, just as America is experiencing a serious spike in ordinary flu cases and alarm bells are ringing about a potential bird flu pandemic. Under political pressure, the CDC has been withholding reports. So we might not even know about the next pandemic until it’s well underway. Large layoffs have struck at the Department of Health and Human Services, including, according to CBS, half the officers of the Epidemic Intelligence Service, sometimes called the “disease detectives,” who play a crucial role in identifying public health threats. There have been layoffs at the FDA, which monitors the safety of food additives and medical devices. And according to the union, several hundred workers have been fired at the Federal Aviation Administration. The list goes on. But peering through the details, the overall strategy is clear: Musk and his minions decided to summarily fire as many federal workers as they could without making any effort to find out what these workers do and whether it’s important. Despite Musk’s escalating claims, these firings won’t save tens of billions of dollars. Moreover, DOGE has mandated large layoffs at the IRS — creating an open season for wealthy tax evaders which will eventually increase the budget deficit. So what is this about? Think of it as austerity theater: suddenly getting rid of thousands of federal workers looks strong and decisive to people who don’t understand what it will do. Remember, just a few weeks ago workers all across the federal government received a mass email urging them to take a buyout offer and “move from lower productivity jobs in the public sector to higher productivity","But in reality, they’re people who are not yet permanently employed. They are temporary, and their work is not yet formally approved. So, they are not a separate class of worker, but rather a transitional one. The term “probationary worker” is not very useful, but in the context of the Trump administration, it has become something of a euphemism. The real question is: What are these people doing, and why are they being laid off? The answer is that they are being laid off in order to make the government more efficient. The real question is: What does that mean? The answer is that it means the government is being radically restructured, and that the current system is being dismantled. The real question is: What is the consequence? The answer is that the government is becoming more inefficient, not more efficient. So, the whole process is a contradiction in terms. The author is not saying that the government should be left as it is. The author is saying that the government should be restructured in a way that is more efficient, but not in the way that the Trump administration is doing it.

Paul Krugman,Democrats Shouldn’t Support Tariffs.txt,"Source: YouGov
Donald Trump’s tariffs are bad economics. They’re also bad politics. I’m not an expert on issue polling, but public opposition to the Trump tariffs looks extraordinary. It’s especially amazing when you bear in mind that many Republicans would support him if he said that the sky was green and all this blue stuff was a deep state conspiracy. Associating yourself with those tariffs in any way is tying yourself to an anchor that has just been thrown overboard. So Democrats need to stop giving Trump cover. They shouldn’t be saying, as Gretchen Whitmer unfortunately did, that they can understand Trump’s motivation. Similarly, Shawn Fain, president of the United Autoworkers, has done his members a disservice by endorsing Trump’s auto tariffs: Republicans don’t care about helping workers, so all he has done is throw away credibility. For the reality is that Trump’s motivation for tariffs, as for everything else, seems to be a desire to punish. In this case he wants to punish other countries, which he insists have treated America unfairly. He’s wrong when it comes to our (former?) allies: Europe and Canada, for example, have done nothing wrong. And while we have real grievances against China, Trump’s tariffs are a very bad way to address those grievances, not least because he’s alienating everyone who should be on our side. But shouldn’t we be trying to restore U.S. manufacturing? Let me make three points:
1. Trump’s tariffs will hurt, not help, manufacturing
2. If you want to promote manufacturing, you should use industrial policy, not tariffs
3. Good jobs don’t have to be in manufacturing, and manufacturing jobs aren’t necessarily good
Trump’s tariffs will hurt U.S. manufacturing
Trump’s tariffs will reduce, not increase, the number of manufacturing jobs in America, for two reasons. First, U.S. manufacturing relies on imported inputs, from steel to screws, that are becoming much more expensive because of tariffs. The latest twist in tariff plans, the exclusion of electronics announced Saturday, lets final products in free while taxing inputs, actively discouraging U.S. production. Let me repost Joey Politano’s quick summary:
Second, the constant changes in tariffs create huge uncertainty. Who wants to invest in manufacturing production when you have no idea what tariff rates will be a few months down the road? I joked Sunday morning that soon Trump would be changing tariffs every day; a few hours later Howard Lutnick declared that the electronics exemption, announced Saturday, was only temporary, which Trump appeared to confirm with a Truth Social post later in the day. \_(ツ)_/¯
But should we forswear all attempts to help manufacturing? No, but we should do it right. If you want to promote manufacturing, promote manufacturing
My guess is that few people engaged in current debates over trade policy and manufacturing know that many of the same issues were addressed in the 1960s and 1970s by economists trying to devise economic strategies for what we now call emerging markets.","But if they were, they’d know about a clear lesson that emerged from that discussion (see, for example, Max Corden’s Trade Policy and Economic Welfare.) Namely, if you want to promote an economic activity you should promote it as directly as possible. So if you think manufacturing is important, you should pursue industrial policies, especially subsidies, that specifically boost manufacturing. Tariffs are at best an indirect way to help, with harmful side effects including higher consumer prices and damage to industries that use imported inputs. Tariffs may look less expensive than industrial policy, but that’s only because many of their costs are off budget. Or to put it another way, if you think promoting manufacturing with subsidies is too expensive, you should definitely be against tariffs, which are actually even more expensive. And you know who did try to boost manufacturing with targeted subsides, and had a lot of success? The Biden administration: Biden also pursued quite tough policies against China that, unlike Trump’s, didn’t punish our own economy at least as much as they punished China’s. Look, I know that many Democrats are pissed at Biden for not stepping aside sooner. But that shouldn’t mean disavowing the good his administration’s policies did. When Bernie Sanders declares that Democrats abandoned the working class, he’s trashing his allies and playing into Trump’s hands: The Biden administration was the most pro-worker government we’ve had since the New Deal, and while Obama was more cautious, he rescued the auto industry, greatly expanded health coverage, and significantly raised taxes on the rich. Why do you think Wall Street hated him? Should tariffs ever be part of an industrial strategy? The only justifications are political. As it happens, U.S. law makes it much easier to impose tariffs than to provide subsidies: Tariffs can be raised through executive action, while subsidies require legislation. This means that there are some circumstances, such as responding to sudden import surges, when tariffs may be the only available recourse. It’s also true that imposing indirect costs on Americans via higher prices sometimes flies under voters’ radar, while direct outlays are more visible. But do we really want to use tariffs to pursue industrial policy because we think voters won’t notice the cost? That may not even work politically now that Trump has raised voters’ consciousness on the issue. So Democrats don’t have to be purists who rule out all tariffs. But they can and should say that tariffs are not how you build a better economy. And if the goal is to build a better economy, policy should focus on creating good jobs everywhere, not fetishize manufacturing, Good jobs don’t have to be in manufacturing, and manufacturing jobs aren’t always good “McDonald’s workers in Denmark are paid more than Honda workers in Alabama.” That claim has been showing up in my inbox, so I checked it out. And it’s true. McDonald’s workers in Denmark are paid more than $20 an hour, in addition to receiving substantial benefits. Indeed.com says that","In the 1970s, the U.S. had a strong manufacturing base, but it was in decline, just as it is now. At the same time, there was a surge in the development of new industries, such as computers, and the U.S. had a strong research base. Yet the U.S. had a problem: it was not investing enough in manufacturing to keep up with the new industries. That’s a problem that still exists today. So the solution isn’t to increase tariffs, but to invest in the manufacturing sector to help it compete with the new industries. The key is to use industrial policy, not tariffs, to promote manufacturing. In the 1970s, the U.S. had a strong manufacturing base, but it was in decline, just as it is now.

Paul Krugman,A Conversation With Elizabeth Warren.txt,"I knew and admired Elizabeth Warren’s work long before she became a senator. Back in the day she was a law professor with a special interest in rising rates of personal bankrupcty. Her book The Two-Income Trap, about how the stresses of families trying to get their children into decent schools pushed many over the brink, was a revelation. So was her dissection of the role of consumer fraud in the financial crisis. She has been remarkably effective since transitioning into a political and policy-making role, too. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, her brainchild, has been a huge success story — which is why Trump and Musk are trying to kill it. She was able to make some time for me Thursday.

. . . TRANSCRIPT: Paul Krugman in Conversation with Senator Elizabeth Warren - 4/3/25
Paul Krugman
So, hi there. Elizabeth Warren
Hi, Paul. Paul Krugman
It's been a much more exciting week in Washington than I would have liked it to be for this interview, because I'd like to talk about issues that are close to your heart. But first, reactions to Wednesday’s Rose Garden speech, the Trump tariff announcements. Elizabeth Warren
So let me set the table just a little bit. I think that tariffs can be a useful tool in the economic toolbox. Right now in the United States, if you have a prescription filled, there’s a 9 out of 10 chance that it was manufactured overseas, probably in Asia, and that even if it was manufactured in India, most of the ingredients came from China. You know, that's a pretty dangerous place for us to be. We get into some back and forth with China and all of a sudden there are no antibiotics for little kids with ear infections. So that can be a place where you put tariffs in place because you want to build a supply chain here in America. You're targeted about it, you know what you're trying to do, and you do it. You follow through and you make it stick. Donald Trump's attempt at tariffs is just dumb. It's broad. It makes no sense. What do we gain by putting a big tariff on lumber from Canada, except that the cost of building a new house goes up? Paul Krugman
Yeah. Elizabeth Warren
And for me, it's more than the individual pieces, it's the chaos around it. First time you announce tariffs and then the market drops, so whoa, he rolls them back and it's like, they're playing red light, green light. And I think even now, a big chunk of the world doesn't know, is he serious about all of those tariffs? Some of those tariffs? None of those tariffs?","And I don't know anybody who invests in an economy who says, “yeah, I'm definitely going to build a factory here in this town in Ohio, or I'm definitely going to start another branch of my business over here in Scottsdale, Arizona,” if you don't know what the environment looks like on what the cost of your materials may be or whether or not you'll have buyers overseas. So I think the tariffs themselves, I just don't think there's enough rhyme or reason to say that there's any coherence here, but I think the even scarier part and worst part for the economy is this uncertainty that it injects and there'll be a price for that for a long, long time to come. Paul Krugman Okay, let me just stay with the tariffs and budget and then we'll get on to your signature issues in a bit. So one of the things, the tariffs are being sold as being a cure for everything, Florax and the dessert topping, but they're being sold as a revenue source as part of this huge Republican tax cut plan. I guess I want to know what you think is actually going to happen and basically what are you and your colleagues trying to do to stop this thing. Elizabeth Warren Okay, so you talked about this week. This week ain't over yet. We've still got the next 36 hours where the Republicans are trying to advance their tax plan. And the heart of this tax plan is about $5 trillion in giveaways, mostly sucked up by millionaires, billionaires, and giant corporations, and paid for on the backs of seniors, little babies, public school students, veterans, and everybody who has pinned hopes on medical research for helping with problems their families are dealing with. This is one of those things that so many people across this country hate, the idea of giant tax cuts for a handful of billionaires paid for on the backs of ordinary folks. And so the Republicans are trying to run all these simultaneous games, hoping nobody will see it. So this is what Flood the Zone is all about. Why are they renaming the Gulf of Mexico? So you're not paying attention to tax cuts for billionaires. Why does Donald Trump want to keep talking about revenues from tariffs? So he's got some counter to the notion that the Republicans are just about to expand the debt enormously in order to give away more to billionaires. Why do we have this sandstorm going on? Because what the Republicans want to do is so damned unpopular, they're trying to keep people from seeing it. And we're only halfway through the week. Paul Krugman So your view is that they're not really serious about believing that lots of revenue will come out of these tariffs. I can't make up my mind what they believe. But yeah, okay. There are also questions about legislative strategy. I mean there's this amazing effort to make","And that's not the way to build a trade policy. Paul Krugman
And the other thing about the tariffs, of course, is that when you put them on things, you have to take them off of other things. So the idea that you can just put a tariff on, say, Chinese goods, and then not have to take them off of, say, American goods, which is what Trump is doing. That's not how trade works. So, in that sense, it's not just that he's being dumb, it's that he's not understanding the economic principles. Elizabeth Warren
Right, and I think that's part of the reason that he's not being effective in trade. He's not understanding the economic principles. He doesn't understand that if you're going to be a trade negotiator, you need to have a comprehensive approach. So if you're going to be doing something with China, you have to be doing something with the rest of the world. Paul Krugman
So, for example, if you're trying to get the United States to be more competitive in manufacturing, you can't just put tariffs on Chinese goods, you have to also do something to make sure that the American workers are more competitive in the global market, so that they don't just get priced out of the market. So that's the whole thing about the American Jobs Act, right? Elizabeth Warren
Yes, and that's the thing. So the American Jobs Act is a comprehensive package that's trying to do that. That's the difference between a trade policy that is a comprehensive approach versus one that's just a bunch of ad hoc, random, one-off things. Paul Krugman
So, for example, the American Jobs Act includes a number of things: the tax code changes, the infrastructure investments, the student loan reforms, the child care investments, the wage and hour laws, the things that make it easier for people to work and for businesses to",457,500,321,0.2093,0.1836,0.9502,0.964,0.7262,0.6901,5.9333,7.0667,0.3755,0.3545,0.0532,0.0853,0.0073,0.0103,0.3755,0.4434,0.9697,0.9567,0.44402985074626866,0.47285464098073554,0.4702842377260982,4,7,0.9571,0.911,0.16849015317286653,0.136,0.2087227414330218,0.942,0.6914,29-05-2025
Paul Krugman,Is This the Year We Doom Civilization_.txt,"On Monday House Republicans released the final parts of their proposed tax and budget bill — and it’s the stuff of nightmares. As Bobby Kogan of the Center for American Progress documents, the bill would impose the largest cuts to Medicaid and SNAP — the program formerly known as food stamps — in history. Millions of low-income Americans would lose health coverage; millions would go hungry. Many of those suffering would be children. The purpose of these cuts, sadism aside, would be to partially offset the cost of huge tax cuts for the rich — cuts that would still explode the budget deficit. The cruelty is mind-boggling. In fact, I have both a suggestion and a prediction for major media organizations: I’d like to see them do focus groups with ordinary voters, describing these plans. My prediction, based on what we’ve seen in the past, is that many voters will simply refuse to believe the policy descriptions, insisting that elected officials can’t possibly be that vicious. But they can be and are. And yet the brutality of the cuts to the social safety net isn’t what bothers me most about what’s about to happen to public policy. Even worse is the assault on renewable energy. From the Financial Times:
Republicans have outlined far-reaching plans to gut government support for clean energy as part of a series of legislative proposals to fund sweeping tax cuts promised by US President Donald Trump. Congressional lawmakers on the powerful House ways and means committee, which is responsible for writing tax law, on Monday released draft legislation that would end renewable energy subsidies and scrap tax breaks for electric vehicle purchases. Meanwhile, fossil fuels would receive billions in subsidies. Are we just looking at money-driven politics as usual? To some extent. If you look at data on political spending by industry groups, oil and gas is overwhelmingly pro-G.O.P.:

While alternative energy mostly backs Democrats:
Source: Open Secrets
But this goes beyond the usual role of money in politics, in two ways. First, it’s obvious that MAGA politicians hate renewable energy in ways that go beyond the fact that they get a lot of money from the fossil fuel sector. Consider what’s happening in Texas, which leads the nation in wind power. You might think that the state’s politicians would embrace a rapidly growing industry that is boosting its economy. But no. According to the Houston Chronicle,
Texas Republicans are getting closer than ever to killing the state’s renewable energy boom, according to the clean energy industry — not only by halting new development in its tracks, but also by possibly sending scores of existing projects to an early grave. Why does MAGA hate renewables? They consider them woke because they help fight climate change, which they insist is a hoax. And they’re cleaner than burning fossil fuels, which means that they aren’t manly. It’s all kind of funny — or would be if it weren’t so tragic.","At this point there’s no legitimate way to deny that man-made climate change is an existential threat. According to researchers at NASA — whose work is, of course, on the chopping block — 2024 was the warmest year on record. But the politics of climate action have always been extremely difficult. The threat isn’t always obvious, since there are still cold days; it’s global, not local; and it’s long-term, with the big payoffs to doing something decades in the future. As a result, the Economics 101 answer to pollution — put a price on emissions — has seemed politically out of reach. As far as I know, every government that has tried to impose some form of carbon tax has paid a large political price. Around 15 years ago it was hard to avoid feeling despair about our chances of steering away from catastrophe. Then came a miracle: Dramatic technological progress in renewable energy, making it drastically cheaper, especially but not only as a way of generating electricity. The International Renewable Energy Agency has a striking chart showing how the cost of electricity generation from various renewable sources has plunged compared with the cost of generation from fossil fuels: Source: IRENA This technological miracle suddenly made an alternative climate strategy possible, one that was all carrots, no sticks. Instead of using carbon prices or regulations to force people to stop burning fossil fuels, policymakers could subsidize and promote renewable energy, nudging us toward an electrified economy with wind and solar — plus, probably, nuclear, which has its place — providing the electricity. Instead of telling people to eat their spinach, we could be advertising job-creating investments. Given how cheap renewables have become, the subsidies probably wouldn’t have to be that large. Wind and solar have been taking off on their own: Source: Energy Information Agency What we mostly needed, arguably, was a push to overcome the network externalities chicken-and-egg issues — e.g., people reluctant to buy electric vehicles unless there are plenty of charging stations, businesses unwilling to build enough charging stations unless large numbers of people buy electric cars. What I’m describing, of course, is something like the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, which was actually mainly about climate and not at all about inflation. And the renewable technology miracle, with the policy possibilities it offered, came just in time. True, even with serious climate change policy finally possible in the United States, and even with other major economies adopting I.R.A.-type policies, it’s too late to avoid a damaging rise in global temperatures. Climate-related disasters are already on the rise, and would keep rising even if we stopped emissions tomorrow. But as of a few months ago there was hope of avoiding the worst. Well, abandon all hope, ye who enter an era of MAGA rule. OK, all may not be lost. There are already enough jobs tied to IRA-linked subsidies, enough businesses that made big bets on the new climate policy, that actual policy may not be as","But the real issue is that the Republican Party is being hijacked by a cult-like ideology that has no place in a mature democracy. That’s not just a problem for the U.S. — it’s a problem for the entire world. The same ideology is being embraced by far-right parties in Europe. It’s a dangerous trend.
The article is quite long. So I have to be careful not to make it too long. But the main idea is that the Republican Party is being hijacked by an ideology that is not only dangerous but also illogical. The author seems to be in favor of the renewable energy and the social safety net. So the conclusion is that the author is against the proposed Republican tax and budget bill. The author is a progressive.
The task is to create a summary of the article, and to determine the author’s position on the Republican tax and budget bill. The summary must be in 5-6 short paragraphs, no more than 100 words per paragraph. The summary must be in the first person. The summary must be in the first person, in the first person, in the first person, in the first person.

Okay, I need to create a summary of the article in the first person, in 5-6 short paragraphs, each no more than 100 words. The summary should be under 500 words total. Let me start by understanding the main points of the article.

Paul Krugman,It’s a Scam! It’s a Purge! It’s a Scam _and_ a Purge.txt,"Before Donald Trump was inaugurated, there was extensive discussion of his known plans to convert a number of civil service jobs into presidential appointments, politicizing the higher levels of the federal bureaucracy. Since the inauguration, however, it has become clear that almost everyone greatly understated the threat. We’re now seeing clear efforts to politicize everything, to force every federal employee to act, in effect, as a MAGA operative. The latest and biggest move has come in the form of an email from the Office of Personnel Management, which appears to have effectively been taken over by associates of Elon Musk, effectively offering a buyout to federal employees who resign in the next few days. On paper, it isn’t exactly a buyout; those who accept the offer will be placed on administrative leave but supposedly continue to be paid until September. But being told that you can stop working while receiving eight months’ salary is just a buyout by another name. There are five things you should know about this plan:
1. It’s illegal
2. It’s almost surely a scam: workers who take the offer probably won’t see the money they’ve been promised
3. To the extent that workers actually take up the offer, they’ll be the workers we can least afford to lose
4. The move will cost, not save money
5. What this really amounts to is a purge, replacing professional civil servants with political loyalists
Legality: Some initial reports described the Trump plan — or is it the Musk plan? — as if it were a simple buyout, which immediately raised the question, where would the money come from? Congress hasn’t voted funding for a mass worker buyout, and the president doesn’t have the right to spend money without Congressional authorization. The “administrative leave” language was probably intended as a way to get around that little problem. But someone didn’t do their homework. The law appears to make it clear that federal employees can be placed on administrative leave for no more than 10 days in a calendar year. Now, does the law still matter? Laws must be enforced by people, and maybe we’re already at a place where Trump can simply ignore Congress’s power of the purse, choosing not to spend money on things Congress has funded while spending money on things it hasn’t authorized. But I don’t think we’re quite there yet. The big scam: If you accept Trump’s deal, resigning but expecting to receive 8 months’ salary, you’re a fool. Trump has a history of not paying what he owes; the Wall Street Journal reported that his business career “left a long trail of unpaid bills,” while a separate study from USA Today found hundreds of contractors alleging that Trump doesn’t pay his bills. So if you accept the not-a-buyout offer believing in Trump’s promise to keep paying your salary — a promise that won’t even be legally binding, because the whole thing is illegal anyway — you should expect to be stiffed.","That’s just who he is and how he operates. Losing the best: Some federal employees may be naïve enough to accept President Musk’s not-a-buyout offer. Others — my guess is a significant number of high-level workers — may leave because they’ve concluded that politicization and disrespect has degraded their work environment to the point that it’s not worth staying. So who will leave? The workers we as a nation can least afford to lose. Many people probably imagine that the federal government offers cushy, well-paid jobs. And as a 2024 report from the Congressional Budget showed, federal workers without a college degree generally do earn more than their counterparts in the private sector — in part because many of them are unionized: Source: Congressional Budget Office But more highly educated federal employees earn substantially less than their counterparts in the private sector. And my personal observation is that this is especially true for people with real expertise. I know federal employees who could clearly be making two or three times their current salaries if they moved to Wall Street. In fact, some of them actually did move to highly paid private-sector jobs for a while, before returning to public service even though it involved a big pay cut. Why did they pay that price? Because they didn’t feel that their lucrative private-sector jobs had meaning in the way public service did. We live in an age in which it’s fashionable to bash government, but my experience has always been that, especially at the higher levels of the civil service, there’s far more idealism, far more eagerness to, well, serve than most people imagine. But if the government is taken over by hacks with no respect for expertise — who, in fact, distrust people who know what they’re doing, and who value political loyalty above all else — the idealists will leave. Money: From the earliest days of DOGE, it was obvious that Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy — who does, in fact, appear to have been run out of DOGE — had no idea how the federal government spends its money. They made a big deal out of reducing the federal headcount, apparently imagining that payroll is a big part of the federal budget. In fact, civilian compensation is a small slice of the budget: Source: Congressional Budget Office And when you bear in mind that the not-a-buyout and the general politicization of the federal bureaucracy will systematically drive out people who are good at their jobs, it seems highly likely that the Musk/Trump actions will end up costing taxpayers money, perhaps a lot of it. So why are they doing this? There isn’t really any mystery about what’s happening here. It’s possible that Elon Musk or whoever came up with this plan really believes that there’s a lot of deadwood in the federal work force — never underestimate how ignorant these people are about the government they’re trying to take over — but it’s pretty clear that the principal","The worst part is that the offer is not just a buyout but a scam. The employees who accept the offer will probably not see the money they’re promised. In fact, the offer is so absurd that it’s not even clear that the government will have the funds to pay it. The cost to the government of the plan is going to be massive. This is the part that’s most difficult to understand: if the government is paying for the offer, that means that it’s spending money it already has. So, the government is not going to be able to pay for the offer, because the government already has the money. The only way this plan would be possible is if the government is taking money from the government, which would mean that the government is paying itself. Which would mean that the government is paying itself. The government is paying itself. That is, the government is not paying the money to the employees. It’s using the money that is already in the government’s account to pay for the buyout. Which would be a bit like a government that took $100 from a bank, gave it to an employee, and then took it back from the employee. The government is not actually giving the money to the employee. It’s using the government’s own money to pay for the buyout, which is a way of saying that the government is paying itself. So the plan is not going to be possible unless the government is paying itself, which is what it’s doing. So, the government is paying itself. The employees are getting nothing. The plan is not a buyout. It’s a scam. The plan is not a buyout. It’s a scam. The plan is not a buyout. It’s a scam. The cost to the government of the plan is going to be massive. The problem is that if the government is paying for the offer, then the money has to come from somewhere. So the government is paying for the offer by",498,500,341,0.2067,0.1899,0.9805,0.8861,0.8729,0.6052,3.2652,-8.8579,0.385,0.3635,0.0504,0.0536,0.0155,0.006,0.6016,0.5632,0.9743,0.9533,0.41455160744500846,0.44502617801047123,0.5445544554455446,6,6,0.9675,0.9083,0.10843373493975904,0.106,0.11143695014662756,0.896,0.4041,29-05-2025
Paul Krugman,"Nathan Tankus, Part II.txt","Nathan Tankus has become an essential resource during these strange and scary times. My last chat with Nathan was about DOGE’s depredations at government agencies. This time I spoke with him about disruptions in financial markets. I continue to be astonished at how important the “plumbing” of these markets — the stuff that makes them function, which we normally don’t even notice — becomes when everything falls apart. And economists in general don’t know that much about the plumbing, so we need help from people like Nathan who do. One thing that struck me during the conversation was Nathan’s explanation of the partial easing of financial stress after the crazy tariffs announced April 2 were replaced by the equally crazy tariffs of April 9. He points out that while a serious analysis of the April 9 tariffs showed that they were as bad in their own way as the original tariffs, the narrative was that policy had eased. And markets, he insists (and I agree) are less information processors than conventional wisdom processors. Much more in the interview. Transcript below. . . . TRANSCRIPT:
Paul Krugman in Conversation with Nathan Tankus
(recorded 4/16/25)
Paul Krugman So hi. Paul Krugman again. I'm doing a second session with Nathan Tankus, who is everywhere these days. He's really in the middle of it. And last time we spoke it was really about DOGE which has by no means gone away as an issue but we're also having crazy action in the financial markets, which is in some ways, Nathan, where you came into this whole discussion. I want to try and actually figure it out myself, but also walk listeners through what's going on. So welcome. I guess this is my show these days. You were actually warning about a potential financial crisis before the whole post Rose Garden stuff. You want to tell us about what you were thinking and we can go from there? Nathan Tankus Yeah. So, I've been calling this series since it started January 31st, the “Trump-Musk payments crisis.” And so this is a lot of what we talked about last time, All of the different ways that this system could blow up. We really emphasized that what the DOGE people are messing with at the Bureau of the Fiscal Service is literally the ability to make treasury payments. And in fact, what they're doing is so catastrophic that making treasury payments is kind of the least of the concerns. That'll be the most immediate thing, but like, you know, not getting money in the hospitals, not being able to collect taxes…
It’s hard to wrap your mind around this because it's so big, it’s kind of beyond a fiscal heart attack. Just, like, making the fiscal machinery of government completely break down. And they
clearly have not really understood that they've been messing with that.","And then an added layer, which I started covering around mid-March and had been investigating for a few weeks is that they took $80 million from New York City or they debited New York City's account for $80 million. That kind of might sound complicated, but it's just like any time that you make a credit card payment, you're authorizing your credit card company to debit your account, so you make the payment. All sorts of other debits or credits are authorized by all sorts of actors, but sometimes these debits aren't authorized. Sometimes they're just done without warning. And normally what happens is, if you do that kind of thing, it's considered fraud and you get frozen out of the payment system if you do it too much. But in this case, because it's the federal government, there's no actor to freeze the federal government out of the payment system once there's a question. In some fundamental sense, the whole concept of money is making a payment, and then that payment is done. That debt is canceled. You've figured it out. Maybe there's some legal dispute that comes up, and they decide to sue you after. But that's a whole new legal environment. There's no taking it back without going through any legal process unless you're the federal government. And from all the experts I've talked to and some anonymous sources, it seems like there's no guardrail on their ability to just take money out of anyone's account. That's messing fundamentally with the concept of money. When money is physical cash and I can hand you some dollar bills and then you can walk away, the idea that the payment is final is kind of easier. I have to go track you down, chase you down, have a court case to find you and send some people out there. But with accounts, there's always that awkward question of, can I just take the money back in your account? And we have all sorts of legal and operational niceties that makes that concept go further and further from your mind. Obviously, there are people who experience these kinds of things already: immigrants before the recent crisis, sex workers, you know, there are all sorts of people at the margins of the financial system who know about how kind of shaky payment finality can be, but it's not a generalized thing in the whole society. It's not, for example, taking money out of New York City's bank account. And so, connecting it back to the financial crisis is, if you start recognizing that the United States government is undermining the concept that a payment is a payment is a payment and that there's payment finality and that you have the idea that at any moment your bank account can be frozen, debited, anything else, and that you can't really trust having money in the bank, even if it's to deposit insured because the Trump administration is taking the prerogative that they","So the first thing that happens is that the treasury payments are delayed, but that’s not the end of the story. And then, of course, as the treasury payments are delayed, they start to delay the payments for the government, which are also delayed. And then, the government can’t collect taxes, so they can't pay the government. And then the government can't pay the government, so they can't pay the government, and it’s like a chain reaction, right? So that’s the problem with the system, and that's the problem with the government. It's not a government that can be trusted to handle its own affairs. It's a government that can't handle its own affairs. So, that's why this is so dangerous. And that's why it's so important to be aware of this. So, I think the whole thing is going to be a crisis, but it's not going to be a crisis that's like a normal crisis. It's going to be more like a systemic crisis. So, I think that's the way to think about it.
Paul Krugman So, this is a really important point, and I think it's a very important thing to emphasize. Because I think that the way that the government works is that there's a certain amount of trust, right? That the government can be trusted to handle its own finances, and that the government can be trusted to handle its own infrastructure. So, in a normal time, you can have a certain amount of trust. But when the government is failing at its basic functions, then that breaks that trust. And that's a problem. So, in this case, we have this crisis that is more about the system breaking down than it's about the government failing. And that's why it's so dangerous.
So, Nathan, let's go to the current situation. The situation is that the government has announced some really, really drastic tariffs, which were followed by another round",478,500,324,0.1014,0.1668,0.9642,0.9133,0.7001,0.9046,7.5119,-1.6721,0.3526,0.3771,0.0391,0.0294,0.0021,0.0026,0.2064,0.5091,0.9737,0.9708,0.44584837545126355,0.47150259067357514,0.5024875621890548,4,5,0.8691,0.8907,0.13807531380753138,0.156,0.21604938271604937,0.801,0.538,29-05-2025
Paul Krugman,MAGA Is Already Eating Its Own. Pass the Popcorn.txt,"Like many observers, I expected severe buyers’ regret fairly early in the second Trump administration. After all, many Americans who voted for Trump did so because they believed he would bring down grocery prices. He was never going to be able to deliver on that promise and stopped talking about the subject as soon as the election was over; sooner or later, voters were going to notice. I did not, however, expect a MAGA civil war weeks before Trump had even taken office. But in retrospect I should have seen it coming. Background: Every political movement is a coalition made up of factions with different goals and priorities. Normally what holds these factions together is realism and a willingness to compromise: Each faction is willing to give the other factions part of what they want in return for part of what it wants. What’s different about MAGA is that I’m pretty sure that almost all of the movement’s activists (as opposed to the low-information voters who put Trump over the top) knew that he was a con man, without even concepts of a plan to reduce prices. But each faction believed that he was their con man, putting something over on everyone else. But now the two most important factions — what we might call original MAGA, motivated largely by hostility to immigrants, and tech bro MAGA, seeking a free hand for scams low taxes and deregulation — have gone to war, each apparently fearing that they may themselves have been marks rather than in on the con. The immediate issue was the H-1B visa program, which grants technical workers (I hate the term “high-skilled,” for reasons I’ll explain in a minute) temporary rights to work in the United States. It’s a program greatly favored by the tech bros, for obvious reasons, but hated by original MAGAts, who believe those jobs should be going to the native-born. But the rift surely runs much deeper. After all, billionaires like their cheap immigrant labor, but original MAGA will feel betrayed if Trump doesn’t deliver mass deportations. News reports on this dispute get the facts right, but you don’t get a proper sense of the emotions and the character of the participants unless you read some of the posts on Elon Musk’s X, formerly Twitter — a toxic site these days, not to be entered without personal protection equipment, but still useful to get the pulse of the people taking over America. Here, for example, is an exchange between Musk and Steve Bannon:
One especially striking thing in this discussion has been the open contempt tech-bro MAGA has for U.S. workers, the people Trump supposedly champions (and the people who buy his sneakers and crypto.) Here’s Vivek Ramaswamy saying that we need foreign workers because American culture venerates “mediocrity over excellence”:
And here’s Musk endorsing the claim that American workers are “retarded”:
As usual, imagine the reaction if a prominent supporter of Democrats were to say anything remotely like this.","What about the actual economics? The Steve Bannon/Laura Loomer view that immigrants are taking jobs away from white Americans (let’s not be euphemistic) is wrong. Although Loomer accuses Musk of “wanting us to live like a bunch of welfare queens,” immigration makes most native-born Americans, including most blue-collar workers, richer, although there are surely a few losers, including, yes, American-born engineers competing with H-1B hires. But the benefits from immigration don’t come from immigrants being smarter or having a better work ethic than the native-born. They come from the fact that immigrants bring skills that are relatively scarce among native-born workers. And I mean skills of any kind, including the skills required in many kinds of manual work, which is why I hate applying the term “skilled” only to jobs that require an engineering degree. When workers with these skills come here, those native-born workers who do have similar skills face increased competition — but their losses, while real, are outweighed by the gains to the much larger number of Americans who aren’t competing with the immigrants. Imagine, for example, that America were to experience a large influx of Polish plumbers. (As I said, skill isn’t the same as having a degree.) This would push down wages for plumbers already here, but it would reduce the cost of plumbing, raising real wages for everyone else, and overall real income for the native-born would increase. There would be some losers in this case. And many economists, myself included, used to believe that immigration of workers with low formal education put downward pressure on wages of all less-educated workers. But at this point it’s clear that immigrants tend to concentrate in very different industries and occupations than native-born workers with similar amounts of schooling, suggesting that they have different skills, and that the number of native-born workers hurt by immigration is relatively small. For the most part, immigrants are complements, not substitutes, for native-born workers. So original MAGA is wrong to claim that immigration is impoverishing “real Americans” in general. But tech-bro MAGA is wrong as well as offensive in saying that we need foreign workers because Americans are stupid or lazy. Furthermore, the availability of less expensive foreign tech workers does reduce the incentive of tech firms to train a home-grown work force and undermines the political incentive to improve our education system. I’d still argue that something like H-1B makes America richer and stronger, especially given the spillovers generated by a successful technology sector. But Muskaswamy and friends aren’t helping their case by insulting Americans’ culture and intelligence. So where is Trump coming down on all this? It has always been clear that he shares the tech bros’ contempt for ordinary Americans, but is he willing to openly sell out his MAGA base? Why, yes: Trump is, of course, lying — the workers on his properties are mainly on a different kind of visa, and he’s rewriting his own history of hostility to H-1B. But the main point is that","These are not just insults, they are open admissions of contempt. They are not just insults, they are open admissions of contempt. The more I think about it, the more I think that the core of the problem is not that the two MAGA factions have different goals, but that they have different views of what the United States is. The original MAGA sees the United States as a country that is in decline, that is being overrun by immigrants, that is a place of moral decay and cultural rot, and that it is a country that should be returned to a simpler, more “pure” state. The tech bro MAGA, on the other hand, sees the United States as a country that is in decline but not because of immigrants. They see the problem as being that the country is being run by a bureaucratic, over-regulated, over-policed, and over-idealistic establishment that is too slow to adapt. The original MAGA thinks the solution is to get rid of the immigrants and return to a more traditional America. The tech bro MAGA thinks the solution is to get rid of the bureaucracy and allow more freedom. But the two views are incompatible. If you want to return to a traditional America, you have to get rid of the bureaucracy, but that’s not what the original MAGA wants. If you want to get rid of the bureaucracy, you have to get rid of the immigrants, but that’s not what the tech bro MAGA wants. So the MAGA movement is not just a movement of people who have different goals. It is a movement of people who have different understandings of what the United States is. And that is the core of the problem. In the end, the movement is not going to be able to cohere — and that is a problem for Trump. Trump needs the movement to cohere, because he needs the movement to be a solid base for his presidency. But if the movement is not going to cohere, then it",497,500,341,0.2076,0.2591,0.9714,0.9579,0.8471,0.7561,-4.103,-6.548,0.3636,0.3834,0.0402,0.0694,0.0098,0.0107,0.0535,0.5788,0.9801,0.9758,0.40241796200345425,0.3927958833619211,0.5326370757180157,8,7,0.9544,0.9775,0.12474849094567404,0.15,0.11436950146627566,0.8943,0.4728,29-05-2025
Paul Krugman,Why You Should Fear a Trumpified Fed.txt,"Sometimes the Federal Reserve has extraordinary power over the economy. Consider what happened from 1982 to 1984. For most of 1982 the U.S. economy was in grim shape. Employment had plunged, especially in manufacturing. The unemployment rate hit 10.8 percent in December (it was 4.2 percent last month.) And economic pain helped Democrats make major gains in the 1982 midterms. But everything was about to change, thanks to the Fed. In the summer of 1982 the Fed decided to ease monetary policy. Interest rates plunged, and about 6 months later the economy began a stunning rebound, growing 4.6 percent in 1983 and 7.2 percent in 1984. Ronald Reagan claimed credit for “Morning in America,” but actually it was the Fed that did it. This episode illustrates the Fed’s power — power that must be insulated from abuse by politicians, especially politicians like Donald Trump. Over the past few days Trump has been demanding that the Fed cut interest rates and calling for the Fed chairman’s “termination.” It’s worth looking at what he posted on Truth Social to get a sense of how, to use the technical term, batshit crazy he is on this subject:
And we really, really don’t want someone that crazy dictating monetary policy. The reason we don’t want politicians in direct control of monetary policy is that it’s so easy to use. After all, what does it mean to “ease” monetary policy? It’s an incredibly frictionless process. Normally the Federal Open Market Committee tells the New York Fed to buy U.S. government debt from private banks, which it does with money conjured out of thin air. There’s no need to pass legislation, place bids with contractors, deal with any of the hassles usually associated with changes in government policy. Basically the Fed can create an economic boom with a phone call. It's obvious that this kind of power could be abused by an irresponsible leader who wants to preside over an economic boom and doesn’t want to hear about the risks. This isn’t a hypothetical scenario. Consider what happened in Turkey, whose Trump-like president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, recently arrested the leader of the opposition. When the global post-Covid inflation shock hit, Erdogan embraced crank economic theories. He forced Turkey’s central bank, its equivalent of the Fed, to cut interest rates in the belief, contrary to standard economics, that doing so would reduce, not increase inflation. You can see the results in the chart at the top of this post. How can we guard against that kind of policy irresponsibility? After the stagflation of the 1970s many countries delegated monetary policy to technocrats at independent central banks. Can the technocrats get it wrong? Of course they can and often have. But they’re less likely to engage in wishful thinking and motivated reasoning than typical politicians, let alone politicians like Trump. What makes Trump’s attempt to bully the Fed especially ominous is the fact that the Fed will soon have to cope with the stagflationary crisis Trump has created.","Trump’s massive tariff increase will lead to a major inflationary shock: Moreover, Trump has also created huge uncertainty by radically changing his policies every few days, which will depress spending and may well cause a recession: Not incidentally, Trump has been able to pursue these destructive policies because U.S. law gives the president enormous discretionary power over tariffs. And now he wants the same kind of discretionary power over the Fed. As a consequence of Trump’s destructive tariff regime, the Fed will soon face a dilemma. Should it raise interest rates to fight inflation, or should it cut rates to fight recession? It’s a really hard call, and it’s quite possible that Jay Powell will get it wrong. Trump has made Powell’s dilemma even worse with his attempted bullying, because a rate cut would be seen by many as a sign that Powell is giving in to avoid being fired. But one thing we know for sure is that we don’t want Trump making that call. Like Erdogan, he has embraced crank economic doctrines to justify his policies, in Trump’s case the ludicrous claim that tariffs won’t raise consumer prices. Does anyone doubt that when inflation rises, he’ll dismiss it as “fake news”? So will Trump’s attempt to bully the Fed succeed? According to the Wall Street Journal, he has spent months talking privately about firing Powell. He doesn’t have the legal authority to do that, but Trump doesn’t worry about pesky things like legal limits to his authority. Yesterday he told reporters that he can easily get rid of Powell: “If I want him out, he’ll be out of there real fast, believe me.” And given how quickly Trump has been able to subvert or destroy many other government institutions, it’s hard to feel confident that he can’t do the same to the Fed. Fear of market reaction — America is already facing a serious credibility problem, with the dollar falling even as interest rates rise — will probably restrain him, but he may not believe people telling him that taking over the Fed would cause the dollar to plunge while long-term interest rates soar as investors expect higher inflation. Between Trump’s tariffs, the economic spillover from deportations and terrorization of immigrants and the attempt to politicize the Fed, the upside risk to inflation now looks very high. The bitter irony is that many Americans voted for Trump because they thought he would bring prices down. MUSICAL CODA","In the past, the Fed has been able to act independently. But now, with the economy in a deep recession, the Fed is going to be in a position where it might have to do what Trump wants — lower interest rates. But that’s exactly what the Fed is supposed to do in a recession. So what is the problem? The problem is that Trump is not just asking the Fed to do what it is supposed to do. He is also demanding that the Fed “terminate” its chairman. That’s the real issue. That is, the Fed must be insulated from political pressure, especially from leaders like Trump.

Paul Krugman,Trump Is Planning the Biggest Heist in History.txt,"Look, there’s a lot going on, most of it terrible. Even so, I’m surprised that we’re just starting to get widespread coverage of the biggest theft in world history — at least so far. And as I’ll explain, a related but even bigger theft, promoted by Donald Trump, is in progress as you read this. Here’s the story: last month hackers looted Ethereum coins worth $1.5 billion from Bybit, a Dubai-based crypto exchange — apparently the most money anyone has ever stolen in a single caper. The FBI believes that the North Korean regime was behind the hack. Most of the coins have already been laundered into Bitcoin, and will eventually be turned into real money that will be used to sustain Kim Jong Un’s brutal dictatorship. It’s quite a story, yet it has only recently begun to get major coverage. The likeliest explanation of this lag is that crypto-related fraud and theft is so rife that reporters and editors have grown blasé. But small investors continue to lose large sums in crypto scams, like “rug-pulls.” And the biggest rug-pull yet is underway: Donald Trump’s plan for a “strategic crypto reserve.”
What’s a rug-pull? A textbook example just happened in Argentina, where Javier Milei, the president, touted a new cryptocurrency called $Libra. The currency’s price soared as thousands of small players bought in, while insiders sold their holdings for huge profits. Then the price collapsed, leaving small players owning worthless bits of code. Does this sound familiar? It should: the $Trump coin, introduced with great fanfare by Trump in January, attracted billions in dollars from MAGA fans, then quickly lost more than 80 percent of its value. The great bulk of $Trump coins were initially bought by a handful of “whales,” large investors, although it’s not clear whether their intent was to scam small buyers or simply to bribe the president. While both Milei and Donald Trump deny that they personally profited from the rug-pulls they enabled, I seriously doubt that anyone believes them. And if Trump manages to establish a federal “strategic crypto reserve,” paid for by US tax dollars, the scams associated with $Libra and $Trump will look like chump change. While a “strategic crypto reserve” sounds a lot like the Strategic Petroleum Reserve — a national stockpile of oil to be drawn down in the event of an energy crisis — it would consist of nothing but a hackable string of ones and zeroes on servers. It’s important to understand that although cryptocurrencies have been around for a while — Bitcoin was introduced in 2009 — no one has yet found significant legal uses other than pure speculation. As far as I can tell, actual transactions involving cryptocurrencies almost always involve criminal activity, such as money laundering or paying ransom to extortionists. Which cryptocurrency do criminals prefer? Most apparently use Tether, a “stablecoin” whose value is kept fixed in U.S. dollars. Tether is able to do this because it holds a stock of U.S.","Treasury bills with Cantor Fitzgerald, an investment bank that has itself invested in Tether. Cantor’s former CEO, Howard Lutnick, is now Donald Trump’s secretary of Commerce. Some people say that the crypto industry has undue influence with the Trump administration. I wonder why? But back to the strategic crypto reserve: What would the U.S. government do with this reserve? Make payoffs to gangsters? Buy favors from rogue governments like North Korea? I guess it could, in a pinch, sell the stuff to raise money if people have lost trust in the U.S. government’s solvency, but surely it would be a better strategy to stay solvent — among other things by not borrowing to buy assets that will probably crash in value if and when America tries try to sell them. So what’s this about? I think this is best seen as one kind of rug pull, a hack pump-and-dump. In a traditional pump and dump, shady investors buy an obscure stock, then drive its price up with false rumors while quietly selling off their holdings. In the “hack” version, the gang hacks into computers at brokerage houses, getting them to buy the target stock without investors’ knowledge — although some individual investors may also be sucked in by the rising price. Again, the perpetrators sell out before the crash. In the case of the strategic crypto reserve, scammers haven’t hacked into computers. Instead, they’ve hacked into the Trump Administration, inducing the president and those around him to announce a plan to use US tax revenue to buy huge amounts of cryptocurrencies with no discernible strategic value. The mere announcement of the plan drove up crypto prices, which plunged after Trump imposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico: If the crypto strategic reserve does happen, the price of crypto will skyrocket. Then, if history is any guide, insiders will sell out. Apparently, at least one speculator, perhaps betting that Trump will have a hard time actually raising the money to buy all that crypto, has already made huge profits by shorting Ethereum. Why should we put our taxpayer dollars into such an extremely volatile entity? Why are we funding a mega-casino where small investors are sure to lose? It’s true that cryptocurrencies have proved to be remarkably durable even though their only serious uses seem to be in enabling criminal activity. Yet experience shows that the most likely outcome of a strategic crypto reserve is that it will go the way of $Libra and $Trump — yielding huge profits for a few big players and huge losses for both taxpayers and low-information investors. Does Trump know that he’s participating in a giant pump-and-dump that will benefit insiders while effectively stealing small investors’ savings? I have no idea, but there’s no reason to believe that it would bother him if he did know. For it’s more obvious every day that we now have government of, by and for crooks. MUSICAL CODA","dollars in escrow. So, in theory, if the value of Tether is kept fixed, it should be legal. But in practice, T Rug-pull is a term used in the crypto space to describe a scheme where the creators of a cryptocurrency project abruptly remove liquidity from the market, leaving investors with worthless tokens. This is a form of fraud, often used to defraud small investors. The example of $Libra in Argentina is a case of a rug-pull, where the government-backed cryptocurrency collapsed in value, leaving investors with nothing. Similarly, the $Trump coin saw a rapid drop in value after its launch, with most of the coins initially purchased by large investors.

Paul Krugman,"Trump Is Stupid, Erratic and Weak.txt","Source: USITC and author’s estimate
Live shot of Donald Trump setting tariffs:
And here’s what happened yesterday:
Anyone sounding the all-clear on tariffs, or Trump economic policy in general, should be kept away from sharp objects and banned from operating heavy machinery. We’re in a hardly better place than we were before Donald Trump announced a tariff pause (in a Truth Social post, of course.) In fact, we may be in a worse place. Let me make four points about Trump’s post-pause tariff regime. 1. Even the post-pause tariff rates represent a huge protectionist shock
2. Destructive uncertainty about future policy has increased
3. We’re still at risk of a major financial crisis
4. The world now knows that Trump is weak as well as erratic
Still a huge protectionist shock
Yesterday Trump announced that he wasn’t going to impose all those tariffs he announced last week after all. Instead, he’s putting a 10 percent tariff on everyone, and 125 percent on China. Question of the day: Does the 10 percent rate still apply to the penguins of the Heard and McDonald islands? Anyway, this new announcement still sets tariffs at a much higher level than they were before Trump took office, indeed higher than he suggested during the campaign. For example, during the campaign researchers at the Peterson Institute for International Economics constructed a model assuming Trump implemented a 10 percent tariffs across the board and 60 percent on China. The researchers concluded that this regime would impose a nasty shock on the US economy. Now we are facing a tariffs of more than twice that level against China as well as 10 percent on all other countries. How high are overall tariffs after the “pause” was announced? That’s actually a tricky question. China accounted for 13 percent of U.S. imports in 2024, and if you apply the newly announced rates to 2024 imports you come up with an average rate of 24.95 — higher than before the pause. Incredibly high tariff rates on China will, however, lead to lower imports from China, so a calculation based on 2024 trade is problematic. However, not importing from China is also very costly: if we no longer import a good from China we must either shift to other, more expensive suppliers or the good simply disappears from the shelves. In the chart at the top of this post I’ve made an estimate of the “effective” tariff rate post-pause. The effective tariff takes into account both direct and indirect costs, and reflects the increase in the cost of living imposed by the tariff. With a 125% tariff on Chinese imports and a 10% tariff on all other imports, I arrive at an effective tariff rate that is slightly below the Smoot-Hawley level of 1930. But this still represents a huge jump in tariffs in a US economy that now imports three times as much as it did in 1930.","Trump’s post-pause tariff regime remains the biggest trade shock in U.S., and I think world history. It's the uncertainty, stupid Like many other observers, I’ve been arguing that uncertainty about Trump’s policies is as big a drag on the economy as the policies themselves. Before the Rose Garden announcement, I warned that it wouldn’t be the end of the story: Trump may impose further tariffs, or slash them as suddenly as he raised them, depending on who spoke to him last. L’Etat, c’est Trump. This kind of uncertainty is paralyzing for businesses, who are realizing that any kind of long-term commitment can turn out to have been a disastrous mistake. Build a plant that depends on imported parts, and Trump may cut you off at the knees with new tariffs. Build a plant that’s only profitable if tariffs stay in place, and Trump may cut you off at the knees by backing down. Again, the point is that there really isn’t a MAGA economic philosophy, just whatever suits Trump’s fragile ego. And so it has proved. So are things settled now? Hardly. The pause is for 90 days. Then what happens? Nobody, Trump included, has the faintest idea. If you imagine that the U.S. can negotiate “tailored” tariff deals with the more than 75 countries Trump claims are seeking a deal in just three months, ask yourself, who’s supposed to be sorting out the details? So if you were a business owner or executive, would you make any major investments or long-term commitments over the next few months? I wouldn’t. Still a risk of financial crisis Yesterday I noted that financial markets were showing the telltale signs of an incipient financial crisis. I looked mainly at the breakeven inflation rate, but many other indicators were also flashing yellow. Even yields on long-term federal bonds, normally a safe haven in troubled times, were sounding a warning. The inimitable Nathan Tankus has a new post explaining why we were and continue to be vulnerable to a new crisis. He explains why the Rose Garden announcement may have been a new tariff-induced “Lehman moment” for the financial system. He explains a lot of stuff that I didn’t know or had grasped only vaguely — in particular, how hedge funds have become key providers of liquidity, even in the Treasury market (via the “basis trade.”) So when hedge funds’ portfolios take a hit from erratic policy, this quickly creates system-wide stress. I’m planning to write a primer about financial crises and how they happen this weekend. The level of financial market stress declined somewhat yesterday, but the situation remains fraught. Trump’s next stupid policy move — and there will be more stupid moves — could quite easily tip us over the edge. Above all, don’t take yesterday’s relief rally as a sign that the danger is behind us. Look at how the NASDAQ behaved after the original Lehman moment: There were several big but short-lived stock rallies along the way to a huge decline.","So the US is now importing more than it did in 1930, but with much higher tariffs. This is a very significant protectionist shock.
Destructive uncertainty about future policy has increased
Trump is now more erratic than ever. He announced a tariff pause, then reversed it. He’s now trying to make the case that he’s not a protectionist, but he’s doing things that are clearly protectionist. And he’s doing it in a way that is confusing, inconsistent, and contradictory. The result is that uncertainty has increased, and that uncertainty is very destructive. The uncertainty is not just about whether he will impose tariffs, but also about what kind of tariffs, when, and on what. In the past, the uncertainty was about the number of products and the size of the tariffs. Now it’s about everything. This is a big problem for businesses. If you are a business that’s trying to plan for the future, you need to have a sense of what the rules of the game will be. But when the rules are changing every day, the uncertainty is more destructive than when they were just unclear. The uncertainty is now so severe that it’s starting to affect the financial markets. For example, the US stock market is down, the dollar is down, and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note is down. These are all signs that the markets are reacting to the uncertainty.
We’re still at risk of a major financial crisis
The financial system is not in a good state. The Fed is under pressure to raise interest rates, but it’s not doing it. The economy is still in a weak state. The US is in a very weak economic state, and the Fed has not yet taken action to fix it. The Fed has been slow in raising rates, and it is not clear if it will do so in the near future. This is a problem.

Paul Krugman,The Third-Worlding of America.txt,"Source: CNBC
Oops, they’re doing it again. Major news media organizations sanewashed Donald Trump all through the 2024 campaign, cleaning up his incoherence and downplaying his extreme policy positions. Aaron Rupar reminds us of this:
It’s hard to know how much that contributed to his victory, but it must have been a factor. But the desire to see Trump as reasonable is a more widely shared syndrome which isn’t confined to the media. It was abetted by the business world, which was gripped by “euphoria” after he won, despite clear signs that he would implement destructive economic policies. Remarkably, the sanewashing continues despite the unprecedented craziness of the past 10 days. Many observers assert that Trump has backed down on tariffs and will speedily make a bunch of trade deals. The first assertion is just false, while the second is very unlikely. In fact, savvy traders have realized that there’s no coherent economic strategy. There’s an old line about military analysis: “Amateurs talk about tactics, but professionals talk about logistics.” Well, when it comes to taking the pulse of financial markets, amateurs talk about stocks, but professionals talk about bond and currency markets. That’s because bond and currency markets are generally less driven by emotion. There’s no “meme gambling investing” in bond and currency markets. And these markets are both signaling major loss of faith in America. First, about tariffs: It’s true that for the time being Trump has scaled back some of the tariffs displayed on his big piece of cardboard last week. For example, unless we have another policy swerve, the European Union will now face a 10 percent tariff over the next three months rather than a 20 percent tariff. But the tariff on China, our third-biggest trading partner after Canada and Mexico, has gone from 34 percent to more than 130 percent. And we still have high tariffs on steel, aluminum and so on. In effect, observers who claim that tariffs have gone down are missing the biggest part of the story. Economists who have actually run the numbers, like those at the Yale Budget Lab, estimate that the April 9 tariff regime will raise consumer prices more than the April 2 regime because of the extraordinarily high tariff rate on Chinese imports. Specifically, the budget lab estimates that the latest version of Trump’s trade war will raise consumer prices by 2.9 percent. This is roughly ten times the probable impact of the infamous Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930. It’s hard to overstate the craziness of announcing a radical tariff plan, then announcing a quite different but equally radical plan just a week later. Furthermore, the claim that the wild zigzags in policy were always part of Trump’s plan just adds to the destruction of the administration’s credibility. But are these tariffs just an opening gambit for trade negotiations? I doubt it.","Bear in mind that Trump and Peter Navarro, his tariff guru, start from the premise that other countries are cheating, that they’re taking advantage of America and treating us unfairly. In fact, however, most of them aren’t. Take the case of the European Union. The EU imposes an average tariff on U.S. goods of just 1.7%, and there aren’t any significant hidden barriers. So what are we supposed to be negotiating about? Nations can’t promise to lower their trade barriers when there aren’t any barriers. Navarro has been claiming that value-added taxes are de facto tariffs, but they aren’t, and EU nations literally can’t afford to give them up. I guess other countries might make fake concessions that Trump can claim as fake victories. This is what he did with China during his first term, claiming that it had made significant concessions — claims which were, in the end, false. In fact, American soybean farmers have never fully recovered the loss of market share. And remember too how Trump made minor changes to NAFTA and claimed to have negotiated a whole new trade pact. However, Trump is now clearly high on his own supply. Even with the April 9 tariff regime, Trump is imposing high tariff rates on our three largest trading partners. Currency and bond market traders — no fools they — are certainly not acting as if we’re on a path to successful deals. For example, economic theory and history both say that the imposition of tariffs normally leads to a stronger currency unless other countries retaliate. During his confirmation hearing Scott Bessent, the incoming Treasury secretary, argued that a 10 percent tariff would lead to something like a 4 percent rise in the dollar. But not this time. Instead of going up, the dollar has plunged. Source: xe.com The obvious explanation is that crazy policies have shaken investors’ faith in America, which has traditionally been viewed as a safe haven. The topic of how Trump’s policies have messed with the bond markets – including the market for US Treasuries -- is too difficult for me to cover today, but here’s more. The key point is that massive tariffs have disrupted the plumbing of the financial system, leading to soaring interest rates on U.S. government debt. That’s abnormal: rising odds of a recession usually lead to falling long-term interest rates, because the prospect of a recession raises the likelihood of future cuts by the Fed, which controls short-term rates. This time, however, rates are spiking, especially for very-long-term instruments like 30-year bonds, shown at the top of this post. The common thread in currency and bond markets is that, thanks to Trump, dollar assets — traditionally the foundation of the global financial system — are no longer perceived as safe. The combination of interest rates soaring amid a slump and the currency plunging despite rising interest rates isn’t what we normally expect for advanced countries, let alone the owner of the world’s leading reserve currency. It is, however,","The problem is that these tariffs are not just being imposed on goods, but also on the dollar itself. In the past, the dollar had a relatively stable value, which made the trade war a relatively simple matter. But now, the dollar is being devalued. The Federal Reserve is still stuck in a situation where it can’t raise rates, and it’s actually lowering them. In fact, the Fed has been lowering interest rates for the past two years. The Fed is the only institution in the country that can raise interest rates, but it has been doing the opposite. So, the dollar is losing value. And this is what makes the trade war a much more complicated matter. The dollar’s value is not just an economic issue; it’s a political one. The Fed is under pressure from the White House to lower rates. The Fed is also under pressure from the Treasury to devalue the dollar. That is, the administration is using the Fed to devalue the dollar. That is a very dangerous and very unusual practice. The Fed is supposed to be independent. This is not the first time the Fed has been pressured, but this is the first time it’s been pressured by the White House. The Fed’s independence is one of the cornerstones of the U.S. financial system. If the Fed is not independent, the dollar will not be strong, the economy will not be stable, and the whole system will not be reliable. So, the dollar’s devaluation is not just an economic issue, it’s a political one. The Fed’s independence is under threat. The dollar is losing value. The economic system is in trouble. So, the question is, how do we get the Fed to stop this? The answer is not to make the Fed more independent, but to make the Fed more powerful. The Fed can be more powerful if the Treasury is willing to take a more active role in financial markets, or if the Fed is allowed to do its job without interference",475,500,340,0.2498,0.0483,0.9903,0.9145,0.8885,0.7418,-2.0231,-4.6866,0.336,0.2553,0.035,0.026,0.0053,0.0,0.6049,0.4987,0.9801,0.9502,0.39676840215439857,0.3901192504258944,0.5062344139650873,6,6,0.9871,0.9891,0.12,0.146,0.1323529411764706,0.8913,0.609,29-05-2025
Paul Krugman,The Stages of Trumpist Economic Grief.txt,"While much of MAGA is motivated by hatred of an open society — by racism, misogyny and the desire to end all things woke — the swing voters who put Donald Trump over the top thought they were supporting a great manager who would fix the economy, reducing grocery prices and restoring good jobs. It was inevitable that they would eventually feel buyers’ remorse, because Trump never had plans to deliver on his economic promises; on the contrary, almost everything he’s trying to do will make the economy worse. Even so, it’s stunning just how quickly consumer confidence has fallen off a cliff:
Source: University of Michigan
What’s truly remarkable from my perspective, however, is that Trump’s economic team seems to be even more despairing than the general public. Bear in mind that “hard” economic data — things like unemployment, job growth and consumer prices — are still looking fairly benign. So you might expect Trump officials to be going on television and assuring everyone that public concerns about tariffs, DOGE layoffs and all that are overblown, that prosperity like you’ve never seen is just around the corner. Instead they’re talking about pain and why Americans should accept it. I find myself thinking about changing rhetoric about the economy as the stages of Trumpist economic grief. So far they look like this:
1. Prices will come down right away
2. Actually, reducing prices is hard and will take a while
3. Sorry, but we need a painful economic detox
4. Hey, there’s more to life than consumer goods
5. ???? As everyone knows, during the campaign Trump repeatedly promised to bring grocery prices down on Day One of his presidency. As soon as the election was over, however, he declared that “it’s hard to bring things down once they’re up.” He didn’t quite say “Nyah, nyah, fooled you!” but he might as well have. And this reversal was completely predictable. What has happened since then has been much more surprising. I would have expected Trump officials to wait a while, to start offering excuses for a bad economy only after the economy actually, you know, turned bad. But no, they’re already telling us to expect hard times as the economy goes through a “detox period.”
Detox from what? The semi-official line is that job growth under Biden was somehow fake, that it was all low-value government employment, and that it will be painful as we move workers back to productive work in the private sector. And some in the news media are actually buying that line. The Washington Post just ran a story with the utterly credulous headline “Trump has a plan to remake the economy. But he’s not explaining it very well.”
So, first of all, why does the economy need remaking?","The claim that job growth under Biden was mainly government employment is completely false: Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics I don’t know whether people like Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, are deliberately lying, although they probably are — these aren’t hard numbers to check. One thing I’ve noticed, however, is that Republican descriptions of Democratic governance often reflect right-wing fantasies about what liberals would do rather than reality. Big cities must be crime-ridden hellscapes even though New York is one of the safest places in America; Biden must have presided over massive growth in government jobs, even though he didn’t. The other problem with the headline is, “what plan?” DOGE has wreaked havoc on federal operations, but its claims to have saved large amounts of money appear to be vaporware. And in any case, most government employees work for state and local governments, not the federal government. So how, exactly, is the economy being “remade”? I don’t know about you, but I don’t think Trump’s problem is that he’s doing a poor job of explaining his plan. I think his problem is that he’s offering fake answers to fake problems, and the public — unlike, apparently, the Washington Post — isn’t buying it. In any case, the real surprise is that Trump officials are making excuses for a bad economy even though the economy isn’t actually bad — yet. Maybe they believe that their boss’s policies will do a lot of damage, realize that they have no influence over those policies, and are trying to get ahead of the curve. But item #4 on the stages of Trumpist economic grief is even more surprising. A few days Bessent declared that “Access to cheap goods is not the essence of the American dream.” When asked to explain his comment on Meet the Press he sort of doubled down: “The American dream is not contingent on cheap baubles they get from China.” OK, he didn’t exactly go all spiritual and call on Americans to reject materialism. He seemed to be saying that the American dream is really about upward mobility and affordable housing, although it’s hard to see what aspects of Trump’s policies will help on either of those fronts. But still, the evolution from promises to reduce prices on Day One to “who cares about consumer prices?” is giving me whiplash. And does anyone expect consumers to accept this new nonchalance about inflation? I don’t. So what’s the next stage in Trumpist economic grief? I’d say that we’re entering uncharted territory, but really we aren’t. Trump is clearly a wannabe authoritarian ruler; the only question is how successful he’ll be at turning that dream into reality. And we know how authoritarian regimes deal with economic adversity. First, they try to hide the bad news. Trump officials have already been talking about redefining GDP in ways they imagine (wrongly) will make Biden’s economy look worse and their economy better. It seems highly likely to me that once Trump’s policies start causing inflation","The economy is doing fine. It’s not clear that it needs remaking. Second, what’s the plan? It’s not clear. The only thing we know for sure is that the economy is not going to get better under Trump. The only thing we know for sure is that the economy is not going to get better under Trump.
I think the best way to understand the Trump economy is that it’s a version of the “new economy” that is not new at all. It is the kind of economy that would be run by a man who has never had a job, who is not really interested in what the economy is, who just wants to be a “great leader.” The new economy is one where the value of money is less important than the value of the person. The new economy is one where the value of the person is not measured by the productivity of the worker but by the number of people the worker is able to influence. It’s a system where the economy is not measured by how much it produces but by how many people it can be a “great leader” to.
This is the new economy, and it’s not new. It’s the same as the economy that was running in the 1970s, and the 1980s, and the 1990s, and the 2000s. It’s the economy that was running in the 1920s, the 1930s, and the 1940s. In fact, the economy is not really an economy. It’s a political system. It’s a system of influence. It’s a system of “great leadership.” The only thing that really matters is that the leader is great, and that the people are great. The rest is just noise.
So, in the end, the real question is not whether the economy is good or bad, but whether the leader is great. And if the",463,500,312,0.3231,0.2465,0.9791,0.9151,0.9408,0.8087,1.1425,-3.472,0.4091,0.3127,0.0617,0.0434,0.0172,0.0013,0.5338,0.5883,0.9762,0.9525,0.4036363636363636,0.4019607843137255,0.536,6,8,0.9978,0.9576,0.13390928725701945,0.118,0.11217948717948718,0.9205,0.4395,29-05-2025
Paul Krugman,Europe_ Is the Force Awakening_.txt,"Since taking power five weeks ago (it seems like longer), Elon Musk and Donald Trump have wreaked havoc on multiple fronts — among other things, rapidly destroying U.S. influence in the world. America has suddenly redefined itself as a rogue nation that doesn’t honor its promises, threatens its allies, tries to engage in Mafia-style extortion, and intervenes in democratic nations’ elections. Trump has a long history of claiming that other countries are laughing at America’s expense. So look at Emmanuel Macron’s expression as Trump declares that he and Musk will be visiting Fort Knox to make sure that the gold is still there:
But the Musk/Trump betrayal of America’s international principles is having an unintended result: Europe’s democracies, which as a group remain one of the world’s economic superpowers, are rousing themselves to fill the vacuum. Consider what has happened in Germany recently. Back in December de facto co-president Musk endorsed the neo-Nazi Alternative for Germany, saying that “only the AfD can save Germany,” and has tried to use his control of X to boost the party’s support. JD Vance met with the AfD’s leader and attacked other German parties for the “firewall” that has kept the AfD out of power. All of this backfired. While the AfD did get 21 percent of Germany’s recent vote, centrist parties will definitely form a governing coalition without it. The interventions of Musk and JD Vance have in fact strengthened Germany’s firewall against neo-Nazis. Even before the election results were fully in, Friedrich Merz, the soon-to-be Chancellor, effectively declared that Europe is finished with American leadership:
My absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA. I never thought I would have to say something like this on a television program. But after Donald Trump's statements last week at the latest, it is clear that the Americans, at least this part of the Americans, this administration, are largely indifferent to the fate of Europe. There are hints that, in order to achieve his aims, Merz will find a way to bypass the German '“debt brake” that has prevented much essential German spending. This is a watershed moment. We may someday look back at the past few weeks as the moment Vladimir Putin lost his chance to conquer Ukraine. Despite Trump’s lies, the truth is that Europe has done more to support Ukraine’s fight for survival than the U.S. has. Yet in their drive to undermine American support for Ukraine, the Putin-loving American Right claims the opposite. Source: Kiel Institute
During his press conference with Macron, Trump tried to minimize Europe’s role, claiming that Europe was simply lending money to Ukraine rather than giving aid. Macron corrected him. It is, in fact, aid:
But Europe could do far more. The continent’s economic performance may have been disappointing in recent years, but it remains immensely rich.","Here’s a comparison of Europe’s big four economies with Russia: Source: IMF Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Italy, each by itself, has greater economic resources than Russia does. Collectively, they have vastly greater weight than Russia. Moreover, the war has placed the Russian economy under severe strain. Yet, for most of Europe, the cost of aiding Ukraine has been barely noticeable. And if Merz’s remarks are any indication, Europe may soon be prepared to do considerably more. At the beginning of the war, America’s stocks of weaponry and its defense industry were critical for Ukraine. After many years of inadequate defense spending, Europe had low stocks of weapons and inadequate military-industrial capacity. So while Europe has provided the majority of the dollars going to Ukraine, the US has provided most of the weapons. So far. Also, bear in mind that when the U.S. provides military aid, the money is mainly spent in America, accruing to the bottom line of American arms manufacturers. Three years on, while some of Europe’s weakness on the weapons front remains, the calculus has changed considerably. While I don’t pretend to be a military expert, I listen to people who are. According to the military experts, Russia’s initial overwhelming military advantage has been greatly eroded, for at least two reasons. First, Russia entered this war with what appeared to be huge stocks of sophisticated military equipment. Hardly any of that original arsenal is left, and Russian industry can’t make up for the losses. Second, war in the 2020s has turned out to be very different from the kind of war that the Russians or, as far as I can tell, many strategists expected. There have been no blitzkriegs — deep penetrations by armored columns, with air power clearing the way. Instead, cheap weapons — first shoulder-fired missiles, now swarms of drones — keep turning expensive hardware into scrap. So the Russia-Ukraine War is a war of attrition, of at best slow advances achieved at enormous cost. So stepped-up European aid can provide Ukraine with the resources it needs to hold on against an increasingly exhausted Russia. To be fair, some of the military experts I talk to worry that Ukraine still needs some sophisticated weapons, like Patriot missiles, that only America can provide. Yet, if Merz’s remarks are an indication of where Europe is heading, Trump may have missed his window for betraying Ukraine and delivering it to the Russians. On economics, where I do have some independent expertise, there appears to be a real possibility that the Musk/Trump Administration will use its “reciprocal tariffs” doctrine to start a trade war with the European Union. This won’t be because Europe imposes high tariffs on U.S. products — it doesn’t. It will be because some Trump advisers have decided to ignore basic economics and claim that European value-added taxes are protectionist. If Musk/Trump does go that route, they will be in for a shock: Europe can effectively retaliate. The European Union is a customs union, with","The EU has more than 400 million people, and it has more than $100 trillion in assets. The EU is not in financial trouble, but the U.S. is.

Paul Krugman,The Clean Little Secret of Social Security.txt,"Social Security is in the crosshairs of the Musk/Trump administration. First Musk came out with the claim that tens of millions of dead people are still receiving benefits. This claim has been thoroughly debunked, but still made its way into deputy president Trump’s big speech Tuesday. Then Musk began declaring that the 90-year-old program is a Ponzi scheme. The first claim seems to reflect the fact that the Dunning-Kruger kids — the mostly very young staffers DOGE sent into the Social Security Administration, too incompetent to see their own incompetence — didn’t know how to interpret SSA databases. The second claim showed that Musk doesn’t understand what Social Security is or how it works. To be fair, however, Musk isn’t alone in his lack of understanding, although he may be unique in his combination of arrogance and ignorance. So I thought I’d devote this week’s primer to the basics of Social Security. Beyond the paywall you’ll find:
1. How Social Security works from workers’ point of view
2. How it’s financed
3. Why the challenge of keeping the system going isn’t as hard as you think
How Social Security works
If you work for someone else, as most of us do, your pay stub shows your gross salary with a deduction for FICA — short for the Federal Insurance Contributions Act. Part of this deduction is for Medicare, which I won’t talk about today. But 6.2 percent of your paycheck, up to a maximum of $176,100, goes to Social Security, matched by an equal contribution from your employer. Only 6 percent of workers earn more than that maximum, so the great majority of workers contribute 12.4 percent of their earnings to Social Security. In return, they start receiving benefits once they reach a certain age — 62 if they’re willing to accept reduced benefits, 67 if they want full benefits. To a casual observer, Social Security looks like an old-fashioned pension plan: you pay in during your working years, then get money back once you reach retirement age. And there’s a good reason Social Security looks that way: When FDR created the system he wanted it to look like a private-sector pension plan, in order to avoid criticism that it was “socialist.”
While there are important features of Social Security that are like a private pension plan, there are two very important differences. Like a private pension plan, Social Security benefits do depend on how much you earned, and hence how much you contributed, during your working years. In fact, that’s the only thing that matters. The Social Security system is remarkably unintrusive into your personal life: the system doesn’t ask for proof that you need the money, it just pays out. But, unlike a private pension plan, the relationship between what you contribute into Social Security and what you get out isn’t one-for-one. There is, in fact, some redistribution of income within Social Security. Americans who earned very low wages get most of those wages replaced by SS benefits.","But high earners are treated much less generously. Here’s the relationship between monthly earnings while you were working and the percentage of those earnings replaced in 2025: If this makes Social Security look like a much better deal for low-wage workers, that’s because that is, in fact, the intention: The program was quietly designed to be progressive, helping low-wage workers much more than higher-wage workers. And one of the clean little secrets of Social Security is it has worked very well to achieve that objective: poverty among the elderly, which used to be pervasive, has been almost completely eliminated. The second way that Social Security differs from an ordinary pension plan is that it is backed by relatively few assets in comparison to its obligations. Most of today’s retirement plans are “defined contribution”, in which your employer is only obligated to put a certain money into an investment account to fund your retirement. However many workers still have traditional “defined benefit” plans, in which you are owned a fixed amount every month for your retirement. Defined benefit plans are legally required to hold enough assets to cover their expected future payments -- even if the company offering the plan goes bankrupt. Social Security, however, has “only” $2.7 trillion in assets. That can sound like a big number, but we’re talking about a very big system. If it had to rely solely on those assets to pay benefits, the system would run out of money in less than two years. Therefore, in order to meet its obligations, Social Security depends on the continuing inflow of money from FICA -- that is, payments into the system by current workers. Presumably Elon Musk is aware of this fact, leading him to call Social Security a “Ponzi scheme.” In typical fashion, Musk apparently didn’t check with anyone who understands Social Security before pronouncing it to be a fraud. If he had checked, he would have learned that Social Security really isn’t a pension fund. It is, instead, a government program supported by a dedicated tax — one of many examples of that practice, although Social Security is the biggest. Paying for Social Security Governments collect money through a variety of taxes. At the federal level the big ones are the personal income tax, the corporate profits tax, and payroll taxes — because that’s what FICA really is. At the state and local level the mix includes income taxes in some but not all states, sales taxes and property taxes. Governments also spend money on a variety of things. At the federal level, the main categories are retirement (Social Security), health care (Medicare and Medicaid) and defense. At the state and local level the big items are education and law enforcement. The simplest way to think about government finances — and also, for most purposes, the right way to think about them — is to imagine everything going into or coming out of one big pot of money. Taxes put money in, while government programs","Americans who earned high wages get only a fraction of what they paid in.
The Social Security system is funded by a tax called the FICA tax. The tax is 12.4 percent of your income, up to a maximum of $176,100, with the 6.2 percent going to Social Security and the 6 percent going to Medicare. The FICA tax is not a flat tax, it’s a progressive tax: the more you earn, the more you pay. The Social Security portion is the same for all workers, regardless of income. So, if you earn $50,000, you pay 6.2 percent of that, and if you earn $200,000, you pay 6.2 percent of that. However, the maximum income that you can pay into Social Security is $176,100, so if you earn more than that, you don’t pay the full 12.4 percent. So, in effect, the system is a flat tax on income up to $176,100, with higher income not taxed at all for Social Security.
In addition, the system is funded by the government’s general tax revenue. The government collects taxes from individuals and businesses that are not earmarked for Social Security, and these taxes are used to pay for Social Security benefits. The total Social Security tax, including the general tax revenue, is about 15.3 percent of your income.
So, the Social Security system is funded by two sources:
1. The FICA tax on income up to $176,100 (12.4 percent of income)

Paul Krugman,In Praise of California.txt,"One of the unwritten rules of American politics is that it’s OK to sneer at and smear our big cities and the people who live in them, while it’s an outrageous act of disrespect to suggest that there’s anything wrong with the Heartland. And many people believe the smears; visitors to New York are often shocked to find that one of the safest places in America isn’t the hellscape they were told to expect. These delusions of dystopia are sometimes funny, but they can have real consequences. As you read this, much of America’s second-largest city is an actual hellscape. But many politicians, from the president-elect on down, are showing zero sympathy, insisting that California — which in its own way gets trash-talked as much as New York —somehow brought this disaster on itself by being too liberal, too woke, or something. And this lack of sympathy may translate into refusal to provide adequate disaster aid. Somehow I doubt that Florida will get the same treatment when (not if) it has its next big natural disaster. (The Biden administration responded with complete, unconditional support to regions hit by Hurricane Helene and other storms, although that hasn’t stopped Republican politicians, like Governor Bill Lee of Tennessee, from lying and claiming that aid was delayed.)
At a fundamental level the case for helping California get through this is moral: Americans should help Americans in their hour of need. But this also seems like a good time to remind people just how much the Golden State contributes to American greatness. Before I get there: Yes, California has problems, some of them big. There are pockets of social disorder, although the fact that so many luxury homes are burning tells us that many people who could live anywhere find greater Los Angeles a highly desirable place to be. More important, California suffers terribly from NIMBYism, which has led to grossly inadequate home construction, crippling housing costs and a lot of homelessness. But California is nonetheless an economic and technological powerhouse; without it America would be a lot poorer and weaker than it is. Most narrowly, at a time when Donald Trump is making nonsensical claims that America is subsidizing Canada via our bilateral trade deficit, California is literally subsidizing the rest of the United States, red states in particular, through the federal budget. The Rockefeller Institute regularly calculates states’ balance of payments — the difference between the amount the federal government spends in a state and the amount the state pays in federal taxes. Here’s what per capita balances looked like in 2022, the most recent year available (blue means a state receives more than it gives, orange the reverse):
California paid in a lot more than it got back — $83 billion in total. So did Washington state and much of the Northeast. Most red states were in the reverse position, getting much more from DC than they paid in return.","And yes, it’s ironic that states that are so dependent on transfers from other states — if West Virginia were a country, it would in effect be receiving foreign aid equal to more than 20 percent of its GDP — vote overwhelmingly for politicians trying to eviscerate the programs they depend on. Even some Republicans have noticed how blue states subsidize red states — here’s a New York Republican lashing out at South Carolina. Now, for the most part this cross-subsidization doesn’t reflect political favoritism. Remember, the federal government is an insurance company with an army, and while military spending has some regional tilt, health and retirement spending per capita across most states is roughly the same. I’m not going to redo the numbers, but here’s a chart I made a few years back, with 2016 data. It shows that the amount of federal spending per capita in a state is almost unrelated to the state’s income, but federal receipts are much higher in richer states, so rich states subsidize poorer states: California, in particular, pays a lot in federal taxes because it’s so much richer and more productive than most of the rest of America. Here’s real GDP per capita in 2023 for selected states and groupings of states: I included Ohio because on Friday an Ohio congressman declared that California shouldn’t receive disaster relief until it changes its forestry management (are there forests in Los Angeles?) He probably doesn’t know that Ohio is, in effect, heavily subsidized, year after year, by California. High productivity in California (and New York, also included) plays a significant role in making America richer; the nation excluding these powerhouses would have about 6 percent lower GDP per capita. California makes an especially large contribution to U.S. technological dominance. As I noted a month ago, 8 of America’s top 9 technology companies — all of them if you count pre-Cybertruck Tesla — are based either in Silicon Valley or in Seattle. And while Hollywood doesn’t dominate films and TV the way it once did, Los Angeles still plays a major role in America’s cultural influence (and still generates a lot of income.) So how should we think about the disaster in Los Angeles? As far as I can tell, there’s nothing either the city or the state could have done to prevent it. There’s a good case to be made that we should never have allowed a huge metropolitan area to emerge in a place that was vulnerable to Santa Ana-fed firestorms even before climate change vastly increased the risks. And of course we should have begun acting to limit climate change decades ago. But this is all hindsight, with no relevance to where we are now — which is that an American city and an American state desperately need all the help we can deliver. It shouldn’t matter whether they’ve earned it. If the United States of America doesn’t take care of its own citizens, wherever they live and whatever their politics, we","The numbers are in the public domain. They are not secret. They are not politically inconvenient. They are not in dispute. The numbers are clear: California and a few other states are subsidizing the rest of the United States.
That’s not to say that California is doing it for free. It’s not. It’s doing it through the federal government. The federal government is not a neutral actor. It’s a national government. It’s a government that has a certain ideology, a certain set of priorities, and a certain set of political leanings. And that ideology is reflected in the federal budget. So the fact that California is subsidizing the rest of the United States is not because it’s a generous state, but because the federal government is giving it a bad deal. The federal government has been giving California a bad deal for a long time. The state is not a particularly wealthy state — it’s the most populous state, not the richest. And the federal government has been giving it a bad deal for a lot of reasons: its geography, its regulatory environment, its climate, and its progressive policies. The federal government has been giving it a bad deal for a lot of reasons.
This is why California is in this mess. It’s not because it’s too liberal, or too woke, or too progressive. It’s because the federal government has been treating it unfairly. And this is why, in a way, the blame is not on California, but on the federal government. The federal government is not a neutral actor. It’s not just a bureaucratic machine that just happens to be in Washington, D.C. It’s a political entity, with a political ideology that is not necessarily aligned with the state of California. The federal government is not a neutral actor. So the answer to California’s problems is not to blame it for the problems. The answer is to fix the federal government’s treatment of California. The answer is to get the federal government to treat California as it should",488,500,339,0.2969,0.2308,0.9884,0.9413,0.9431,0.4672,-1.4812,-13.8802,0.3852,0.3315,0.0446,0.0626,0.0043,0.0204,0.39,0.3956,0.9798,0.9602,0.39713774597495527,0.41638225255972694,0.5183374083129584,9,8,0.9969,0.8877,0.11885245901639344,0.11,0.12979351032448377,0.9249,0.454,29-05-2025
Paul Krugman,Trump Is Doing Exactly What He Said He Would. Who Could Have Predicted That_.txt,"When democracies die, big business and wealthy individuals often play a crucial role in their demise. They provide a would-be strongman with financial support; their control of or influence over news media ensures that he receives favorable coverage, while his opponents are trashed. They do this because they expect to be rewarded with policies that favor their interests and imagine that they will in effect be shareholders in the new autocracy. What comes next is familiar to anyone who studies history (which the oligarchs don’t.) Eventually it becomes clear that they don’t own the dictator they’ve helped install; he owns them. Maybe they’ll like some of his policies, maybe they won’t, but in any case they’re not in control — and they soon learn that criticizing the big man isn’t just fruitless, it’s dangerous. In the past this script has typically taken a few years to play out, but this is the internet age, so right now in America the process seems to be taking only a few weeks. Donald Trump’s decision to launch an all-out trade war, not with China, but with our neighbors and allies — who are gearing up for large-scale retaliation — probably isn’t the most important thing happening right now. I’ll talk in a minute about what is. But it has certainly come as a wake-up call for business. It would be funny if it weren’t so serious. Actually it is funny if you’re into gallows humor. Trump spent the entire campaign proclaiming that he was a Tariff Man, promising high tariffs and asserting that we were somehow subsidizing Canada and Mexico. Yet businesses and bank analysts blithely assumed that he didn’t really mean it. On Inauguration Day he made a very specific promise: 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico by Feb. 1. Yet the newsletter I receive from Goldman Sachs summarized the day with the headline “A More Benign Tone on Tariffs,” and declared
Despite Trump’s comments, we continue to believe the odds of a 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico are low (20%). And Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, told everyone to calm down about Trump’s tariffs:
If it’s a little inflationary but it’s good for national security, so be it. I mean, get over it. Is Dimon getting over it right now? I have great respect for the economics team at Goldman, which has called many things right over the years. But like many in the business community, they are clearly clueless when it comes to facing the new political reality. One team I don’t respect is the editorial board at the Wall Street Journal. But they got it right with Friday’s editorial:
The question, however, is, what did they expect? The Journal has spent decades promoting the economic ideas of charlatans and cranks; now it’s upset to find out that cranks are in full control, but they aren’t their cranks. And Trump spent the entire campaign signaling his intention to start a destructive trade war.","It’s a bit late to be shocked, shocked that he meant what he said. What should really have the Journal upset, however, is Trump’s response: What you need to understand is that in MAGA world, calling someone a “Globalist” isn’t just an insult; it’s a threat of retribution. And I’d put fairly high odds on the proposition that sometime in the fairly near future the Journal will issue an abject, groveling apology for daring to question Trump Thought. For as I said, the trade war, drastic as it is, isn’t the most important story right now. It takes second place to what looks like a quiet takeover of the machinery of government. Here’s how it works: Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary — whose selection was, financial types assured me, an indication that Trump wouldn’t go wild — has given associates of Elon Musk, who as far as we know aren’t even government employees let alone officials with the right security clearance, access to the computers at the Treasury department that control the federal government’s financial plumbing — that make payments to contractors, workers, everything. This situation gives Musk’s minions the ability to download millions of Americans’ private information. But people who understand the system better than I do say that it also effectively gives them control of public spending. Congress may have passed a law mandating that money be spent for some public purpose; but Musk and company may simply, in effect, tell the system not to cut the checks. If this is really the case, and serious people say that it is, we may already have experienced what amounts to a 21st-century coup. There may not be tanks in the streets, but effective control of the government may already have slipped out of the hands of elected officials. I’ll have more to say about this once I understand it better, and also as events play out. But meanwhile business goes on — or, in many cases now that the trade war has begun, maybe it doesn’t go on. So let me get back to the tariffs. As I get ready to hit the publish button, stock futures are down — but not nearly as much as the situation seems to warrant. Investors still seem to believe that there’s a good chance that Trump will use some minor concessions (about what?) to declare victory and dial the tariffs back. As I wrote about the same time Goldman and Dimon were telling us to chill out, this market complacency is a self-defeating prophecy: muted market reaction makes it likely that Trump will continue and expand his trade war. And even if some of the tariffs prove temporary, the Rubicon has been crossed. We now know that when the United States signs an agreement, on trade or anything else, the president will treat that agreement as a mere suggestion to be ignored whenever he feels like it. That revelation in itself will do huge long-term damage. All of this was entirely predictable.","The WSJ is not the only one who got it right. The New York Times, in its editorial page, has been very clear that it is against a trade war. So has the Washington Post, and the Boston Globe, and the Chicago Tribune, and the Los Angeles Times. The main newspapers in the country have all been correct on this one. But the business community? They seem to think that the next step is to just go along with the war, and hope that it doesn’t hit them. They have not been paying attention. They have not been learning from history. They have not been paying attention to the new political reality. They have been assuming that the old rules still apply. They have been assuming that Trump is a “president,” not a “ruler,” and that the new administration will be “democratic” and “accountable” — and that the old system of political processes and institutions still applies. They have been assuming that the president is not the master of the situation, but rather the servant of the people. They have been assuming that the president is just a “leader,” not a “ruler.” But they are wrong. The new president is not a servant of the people. He is their master. He is a ruler. And he is not going to be held accountable by the people for what he does. Not in the short term. Not in the near future. He is not going to be held accountable by Congress. He is not going to be held accountable by the courts. He is not going to be held accountable by the media. He is not going to be held accountable by the public. The only way he is going to be held accountable is if he decides he wants to be. And if he decides he wants to be, then he will be. So what is the solution? What is the way to hold the new ruler accountable? The answer is to make sure that he is not the ruler. The answer is to make",495,500,345,0.1746,0.0653,0.9791,0.9399,0.8561,0.5772,3.3497,-8.4231,0.3445,0.3116,0.038,0.0454,0.0031,0.006,0.5387,0.4946,0.973,0.9557,0.44574290484140233,0.4268707482993197,0.5452261306532663,6,5,0.9811,0.9243,0.12525252525252525,0.12,0.11594202898550725,0.9524,0.526,29-05-2025
Paul Krugman,The Pathetic Billionaires’ Club.txt,"Today’s newsletter will be a bit different from my usual. In general, I do data-driven posts, mainly about economics — and that will remain the norm. But right now, as some of the worst people in America are about to take power, doesn’t feel like the time for charts from FRED. So this entry will be informal and impressionistic, based partly on things I’ve seen, partly on speculation. So: Much of the political and business world is prostrating itself at the feet of the least-qualified man, morally and intellectually, ever to occupy the White House. It’s understandable if not excusable why many of those declaring fealty are doing so. If you look at what has happened to Liz Cheney or Adam Kinzinger you realize that Republican politicians who stand up to Trump destroy their political careers and put themselves at real personal risk. Many businesspeople — including media owners — fear that they will suffer monetarily if they cross the new regime. But what’s truly extraordinary is the way billionaires have been abasing themselves before Donald Trump, a spectacle highlighted by Ann Telnaes’s now-famous cartoon — the one Jeff Bezos spiked, causing her to quit the Washington Post:
PS: I strongly urge everyone to show Ann Telnaes some love by reading her Substack, getting a paid subscription if you can afford it. Why is this self-owning by billionaires so extraordinary? Well, ask yourself: What’s the point of being rich? Past a certain level of wealth, it can’t really be about material things. I very much doubt that billionaires have a significantly higher quality of life than mere multimillionaires. To the extent that there’s a valid reason for accumulating a very large fortune, I’d say that it involves freedom, the ability to live your life more or less however you want. Indeed, one definition of true wealth is having “fuck you money” — enough money to walk away from unpleasant situations or distasteful individuals without suffering a big decline in your living standards. And some very wealthy men — most obviously Mark Cuban, but I’d at least tentatively include Bill Gates and Warren Buffett — do seem to exhibit the kind of independence wealth gives you if you choose to exercise it. The likes of Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg, however, surely have that kind of money, yet they’re prostrating themselves before Trump. They aren’t stupid; they have to know what kind of person Trump is and understand — whether or not they admit it to themselves — the humiliating nature of their behavior. So why do they do it? The answer, I believe, is that many (not all!) rich men are extraordinarily insecure. I’ve seen this phenomenon many times, although I can only speculate about what causes it.","My best guess is that a billionaire, having climbed to incredible heights, realizes that he’s still an ordinary human being who puts his pants on one leg at a time, and asks, “Is this all there is?” So he starts demanding things money can’t buy, like universal admiration. Read Ross Douthat’s interview with Marc Andreessen, in which the tech bro explains why he has turned hard right. Andreessen says that it’s not about the money, and I believe him. What bothers him, instead, is that he wants everyone to genuflect before tech bros as the great heroes of our age, and instead lots of people are saying mean things about him and people like him. Of course, Trump’s victory won’t do anything to restore the adulation he misses, so I can confidently predict that Andreesen and others in his set will keep on whining — that there will be so much whining that we’ll get sick of whining. Actually I already am. Or consider the Elon Musk gaming scandal. Many people in the gaming world, which is huge, believe that Musk, who claims to be an avid and expert gamer, has been faking it, either by having someone else play for him or by using a more skilled player’s account. It’s a deeply embarrassing story, if true. And while I don’t know anything about gaming, the accusations seem credible — and completely consistent with Musk’s behavior in areas I do know something about. His attempts to pose as a budget guru and a macroeconomist have, for those familiar with even the most basic facts, been as cringeworthy as his apparent fakery in video games — although for sheer cringe value nothing matches Mark Zuckerberg’s talk about “masculine energy.” What the gaming story suggests is something I already suspected: Musk’s frenetic interventions on behalf of right-wing, racist politicians around the world are doing real harm — he definitely helped Trump win, his influence is one reason horrible people like Pete Hegseth will probably be confirmed for office, and sooner or later Musk will end up inspiring violence. But they shouldn’t be seen as a coherent political strategy. They are, instead, efforts to fill the emptiness inside. But what about Bezos and Zuckerberg? Both made bids to define themselves as more than their wealth, Bezos by buying the Washington Post, Zuckerberg by unveiling Threads as an alternative to Nazified Twitter. But both lost their nerve. Bezos, initially seen as the Post’s savior, ended up trashing its reputation (and readership) with his political cowardice. Zuckerberg implemented an algorithm that made Threads uncontroversial and hence irrelevant, then lobbied hard and successfully to block efforts to protect children from the clear harm social media does. So now they are defined by their wealth and nothing more, which I believe explains their submission to Trump. Trump would probably be able to damage their businesses if they didn’t bend the knee, but that would still leave them immensely wealthy, just possibly no longer among the wealthiest men","In some cases, it might be that the money was earned in a very competitive, cutthroat environment, and thus the rich man has learned that the way to maintain his status is to be very loyal to the powerful. In other cases, it might be that the rich man has a deep-seated fear of being seen as a failure, or that he has a need for approval. It’s possible that the most successful of the rich men have a need for approval. The idea that the rich are not all powerful and that they can be humiliated by a man like Trump — who is not only not rich but is also not even that smart — is very threatening to the self-esteem of some rich men. The problem is that they’re not just being humiliated by a person they don’t know; they’re being humiliated in public, by a man they know, a man who is very much in their business. They are being humiliated in front of their own peers, their own colleagues, and their own family. The public humiliation of a billionaire is something that even a moderately wealthy person can imagine, but in the case of a billionaire, the consequences are far more severe. For example, if a billionaire were to be publicly humiliated by a person who is not rich, the billionaire might be able to simply walk away, but if the billionaire is not rich, he might not be able to. So the question is: Why is it so hard for these rich men to resist the temptation to be humiliated in front of the powerful? It seems to me that the answer lies in the fact that they are not just rich, but also very powerful, and that they are not in the habit of resisting the temptation to be humiliated. So, I think the key to the problem is that these rich men have not been conditioned to be independent. They have been conditioned to be loyal to the powerful, and to be obedient to the powerful. So, in the case of the Trump",458,500,351,0.1568,0.1071,0.9771,0.9487,0.9103,0.7773,2.0909,6.0804,0.3347,0.3374,0.0202,0.0334,0.0011,0.0,0.6079,0.5336,0.9757,0.9739,0.42962962962962964,0.4148397976391231,0.5750636132315522,6,6,0.974,0.9775,0.1222707423580786,0.118,0.10256410256410256,0.9878,0.5258,29-05-2025
Paul Krugman,"Smears, Sadism and Social Security.txt","We often think of Social Security as a retirement program, which it is; most Social Security beneficiaries achieve that status simply by reaching retirement age. But the program also helps Americans with disabilities that prevent them from working or limit their ability to work, and for millions of people these benefits are a crucial lifeline. Now the Social Security Administration, following orders from Elon Musk’s DOGE, appears set to subject disabled Americans to immense hardship. And everything we know indicates that this act of cruelty is mainly motivated by a combination of ego and spite. The story so far: On March 12 the Washington Post reported that the Social Security Administration was considering ending phone service for Americans filing retirement or disability claims. The SSA quickly backed off that idea — sort of. The day after the Post report, however, the agency circulated an internal memo — acquired by the newsletter Popular Information — laying out a plan that would be almost equally destructive. Under this plan, beneficiaries would still be able to call the SSA. But they would have to verify their identity either over the internet or through in-person visits to field offices. Bear in mind that we’re talking about older and/or disabled Americans, many of whom are unable to access the internet and physically unable to visit SSA offices — which would in any case be overwhelmed by the increased traffic, given that the agency is already facing large staffing cuts. So this would be a move of almost cartoonish cruelty, and a nightmare for millions of Americans. Why do this? The alleged justification is to combat fraud. But ProPublica has acquired audio of a closed meeting held with Leland Dudek, the Social Security Administration’s acting administrator, in which he acknowledged that fraudulent benefit claims are not, in fact, a serious problem. So what the Musk is going on here? This plan would save some money, not by eliminating fraud, but by effectively cutting off aid to Americans who are legally entitled to that aid, and specifically those who need it most. But I don’t think the savings are the point. My guess, instead, is that it’s an ego thing, that Social Security has become to Musk what Canada has become to Donald Trump. Both men at one point said something stupid, something that would have turned them into laughingstocks if there weren’t so much fear in the air. But both men have been unable to let go, doubling down in what amounts to an attempt to redeem their initial foolishness. In case you’ve forgotten, back in December, when Justin Trudeau visited Mar-a-Lago, Trump taunted him by suggesting that Canada become a U.S. state, calling him “Governor Trudeau.” Some people suggested that it was meant as a joke, but it would be more accurate to call it a dominance display. But once Trump realized how ridiculous the performance made him look, he refused to let go.","Instead, annexing Canada seems to have become a fundamental plank of Trump’s foreign policy, with his demands getting ever more insistent the more obvious it becomes that Canadians loathe the idea. Musk’s big blooper was his claim that millions of dead people are receiving Social Security checks. This claim probably reflected the failure of young Musk staffers — what Dudek called the “DOGE kids” — to understand how the SSA’s databases work, combined with a complete lack of common sense. I mean, if there really were huge numbers of dead people receiving Social Security payments, don’t you think someone else would have noticed? In a normal political environment, getting something that big that wrong would have destroyed Musk’s credibility and led to his permanent exile from any role in setting policy. But this is America in 2025, so Trump amplified the already-refuted claim when addressing Congress, and Musk seems more powerful than ever. Furthermore, Musk refuses to give up his Social Security smears, making the completely implausible claim that fraudulent use of Social Security numbers accounts for 10 percent of federal spending. And I’d argue that that the plan to effectively cut off many disabled Americans is best seen as part of a desperate effort to find or pretend to find Social Security fraud, retroactively justifying Musk’s big mistake. Still, does the plan have to be this cruel to the most vulnerable Americans? As I see it, the cruelty is a feature, not a bug. After all, gratuitous, seemingly gleeful cruelty has been a hallmark of DOGE’s operations. Even if you think DOGE’s mass layoffs — some quickly reversed when it turned out that critical workers were fired — make sense, think of the way they are being carried out. In general, workers are being fired with no warning, no chance to make plans for the future, and often face insulting (and false) claims that they were poor performers. It's hard to escape the sense that DOGE staffers are actually enjoying this. And why not? We’re mostly talking about poorly socialized young men suddenly given the power to ruin other people’s lives, taking their cues from a leader who has declared that “the fundamental weakness of Western society is empathy.” So why should we be surprised that the DOGE kids’ rampage through the government looks more and more like a remake of Lord of the Flies? Back to Social Security: There will, I expect and hope, be a huge backlash if the plan to effectively cut off millions from benefits goes through. But don’t count on Musk — or Trump — to change course. These are men with fragile egos, who never, ever admit being wrong. MUSICAL CODA Check out this band’s story; it’s pretty amazing","Similarly, Musk is trying to redeem his initial foolishness by doubling down on the DOGE, which he had previously used to make some very stupid and controversial statements. In both cases, the move is driven by a desire to be right, to be seen as right, and to be seen as having the last word. The result is a series of actions that are more about the ego than the actual problem. And in both cases, the result is a series of actions that are more about the ego than the actual problem. The plan to cut off phone access for disabled Americans is not about saving money, but about showing that Musk is right, and that he is not a fraud. So, the question is, who is the real victim here? The answer is: the disabled Americans. The people who are most in need of the program are the ones who are being punished for being in need. It’s a clear case of the rich being left alone while the poor are punished. In this case, it’s the disabled being punished. The real question is, who is the real victim? The answer is: the disabled. The author is arguing that the Social Security Administration’s new policy is a harmful and cruel act driven by Musk’s ego and spite, and not by any real need to combat fraud. The author is also arguing that this policy disproportionately affects disabled Americans, who are already vulnerable and rely on the program for support. The author is also drawing a parallel between Musk’s actions and Trump’s, suggesting that both are driven by a desire to assert dominance and to be seen as right, rather than by a genuine concern for the public good.

Paul Krugman,The Cost of Chaos_ This is Getting Scary.txt,"Source: Google. Herbert Hoover, move over. The 31st president has long been the patron saint of bad economic management. But while Hoover responded badly to the coming of the Great Depression, he didn’t cause the slump. By contrast, it seems more and more likely that Donald Trump will single-handedly push the solid economy he inherited into crisis. This is, as Trump might say, disastrous policy like nobody has seen before. How is he managing that feat? While the vast majority of economists think high tariffs are bad policy, they don’t normally associate them with recession. Many, perhaps most economists who’ve looked hard at the evidence don’t accept the popular story that the Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930 caused the Great Depression. But this time looks and feels different. Why is a Trump Slump brought on by tariffs looking more probable by the day? Like many others, I’ve been talking a lot about the huge uncertainty Trump is creating. Ignore the desperate efforts to retcon Trump’s trade policy, to pretend that it comes out of some coherent economic doctrine. We’re clearly looking at tariffs driven by id, not ideology — Trump’s biggest motivation seems to be the desire to see other countries grovel. Because there’s no clear policy objective, nobody knows what Trump will do tomorrow, let alone over the next few years. Did you have 104 percent tariffs on China and 34 percent tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber on your dance card? (Are 2x4s the industry of the future?)
As I wrote a few days ago,
Permanent tariffs are bad for the economy, but businesses can, for the most part, find a way to live with them. What business can’t deal with is a regime under which trade policy reflects the whims of a mad king, where nobody knows what tariffs will be next week, let alone over the next five years. Are these tariffs going to be permanent? Are they a negotiating ploy? The administration can’t even get its talking points straight, with top officials saying that tariffs aren’t up for negotiation only to be undercut by Trump a few hours later. Under these conditions, how is a business supposed to make investments, or any kind of long-term commitment? Everyone is going to sit on their hands, waiting for clarity that may never come. But wait, there’s more. There are growing signs that we’re at risk of a tariff-induced financial crisis. There are multiple indicators of that risk. Bear with me while I give a somewhat wonkish explanation of one indicator that really caught my eye. Back in the good old days, that is, two weeks ago, the main concern about Trump’s tariffs was that they would cause sustained inflation. We knew that they would produce at least a temporary bump in consumer prices, but the big question — crucial for Federal Reserve policy — was whether this bump would lead to a sustained rise in expected inflation, and become entrenched in the economy.","That’s what happened in the 1970s and is the reason getting inflation down in the 1980s required years of high unemployment. It didn’t happen during the Biden years, which is why this time we were able to get inflation way down without a recession. So everyone has been watching measures of expected inflation for clues. And the news from consumer surveys has been very worrying. Here’s long-term expected inflation from the widely cited Michigan Consumer Surveys: Source: University of Michigan Whoa. But consumers don’t set prices. Furthermore, the last few years have shown that what consumers say they believe about the economy isn’t a good predictor of their behavior. So you’d want some confirmation from other measures. Late last month Austan Goolsbee, president of the Chicago Fed, said that it would be a “major red flag of concern” if market-based measures of expected inflation rose. He mainly meant “breakeven” rates, the spread between interest rates on bonds that are indexed to consumer prices and bonds that aren’t. That spread can normally be seen as an implicit prediction of how much consumer prices will rise. So here’s the 5-year breakeven rate this year: Wait, what? Has expected inflation actually fallen as Trump’s tariff plans have proved far more aggressive than anyone expected? No, that’s not what’s happening. What we’re actually seeing is investors, especially hedge funds, selling assets in a “dash for cash.” When investors sell off bonds, they drive their price down, which means that they push their yield up. Why does this cause the breakeven rate to fall? Because the market for indexed bonds is relatively small and thin, so the rush to sell has a bigger effect in depressing prices and raising interest rates for index bonds than for ordinary bonds. This isn’t the first time this has happened. Look at the breakeven rate over the long term: It plunged during the 2008-9 financial crisis and again when Covid hit: Investors weren’t really predicting huge deflation in 2008-9, they were just rushing to sell assets and raise cash. And that’s what’s happening now, although not to the same degree (yet). In other words, I was looking for guidance about inflation and instead found the telltale signs of an incipient financial crisis. Others, looking at other indicators, from the basis trade to junk bonds to struggles to refinance private loans, are seeing the same thing. Why is this happening? Trump’s erratic policies have increased the risk of recession, but besides that their sheer extremism — from almost-free trade to tariffs higher than Smoot-Hawley in less than three months — has hurt some borrowers much more than others. Look at the chart at the top of this post. There’s a reason Elon Musk is lashing out at Peter Navarro, Trump’s tariff guru, calling him “Peter Retarrdo” and declaring that he is a “moron” and “dumber than a sack of bricks.” Aren’t you glad that grownups are in charge? And here’s the thing: Lenders will be hurt if some borrowers are","That is, would it lead to a permanent inflationary bias? If so, the Fed would be forced to raise interest rates, which would cause a recession. But the question is: would the tariffs lead to permanent inflationary bias? The answer is: not if the tariffs are temporary, but if they are permanent, then the answer is yes. So, the question is: are these tariffs permanent? If they are, then the Fed has to raise rates, which causes a recession. But in the past, we have not seen this logic applied to tariffs. For example, the Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930 was considered a major cause of the Great Depression, but in that case, the tariffs were permanent. However, even then, the economy was still in the midst of a depression. The question is whether the tariffs are permanent. But now, with the economy in relatively good shape, and the tariffs not yet in place, we are in a situation where the Fed can choose to let the tariffs be temporary. If the tariffs are temporary, the Fed can avoid a recession. If the tariffs are permanent, then the Fed has to raise rates. So, the question is: will the tariffs be permanent? If they are, then we are in for a recession. If they are not, then we are not. But the administration is not showing the least bit of interest in showing any sort of consistency in its trade policy. The administration has not been clear about the permanence of the tariffs, and is now trying to reverse course. The president has said that the tariffs are not permanent, but he also said they are. The vice president has said they are not permanent, but he also said they are. The White House has said they are not permanent, but the administration is now trying to get the tariffs to be permanent. So, in the end, we don’t know. So, we are in a situation where the Fed is in the awkward position",494,500,333,0.1509,0.287,0.987,0.9244,0.9373,0.8568,1.1379,-2.4348,0.3268,0.3408,0.0353,0.0514,0.0,0.0117,0.3686,0.4398,0.9788,0.9606,0.40683760683760684,0.4236453201970443,0.5153846153846153,7,6,0.9732,0.9815,0.13157894736842105,0.128,0.16816816816816818,0.9437,0.5105,29-05-2025
Paul Krugman,Autogolpe.txt,"My very first post after I left the Times and brought this newsletter out of dormancy was about DOGE, the not-a-government-agency created by Donald Trump and run by Elon Musk (Vivek Ramaswamy has been run out of DOGE.) The supposed goal of DOGE was to save taxpayers huge sums by going after “waste, fraud and abuse.” I argued that this effort was doomed to failure as Musk and his cronies appeared completely ignorant about how and why the federal government spends taxpayer dollars. While everything I said was true, I would like to offer a mea culpa. What should have been clear to me even then, and is unmistakable now, is that everything Musk and Trump say about what they’re doing is false, including what they say about their motivations. The ignorance and chaos are real, but you should never lose sight of the underlying thrust of their actions. For what’s happening in America right now is an attempted autogolpe. Latin American readers are surely familiar with the term. An autogolpe is literally a “self-coup” — when a legitimately elected leader uses his position to seize total control, eliminating legal and constitutional restraints on his power. Are Musk and Trump trying to pull off an autogolpe here? Of course they are. And they are doing so with, as far as I can tell, the full support of every Republican in the House and the Senate. You should look at everything they do through that lens. Yes, we can ask whether a policy move makes sense in terms of its announced goals. But you should also always ask, “How does doing this serve the autogolpe?”
Take, for example, DOGE’s obsession with finding ways to lay off federal workers. This makes no sense as a priority if you know anything about where the taxpayer dollar goes:
The federal work force is no larger now than it was under Dwight Eisenhower. But making “headcount reduction” a policy goal is a way to purge civil servants who remain loyal to the law and the Constitution and replace them with Trump and Musk loyalists. Fortunately, the Trump Administration’s push to induce federal workers to take buyouts appears to be a bust. Many of the relative handful of workers who took the sort-of-a-deal before a judge put it on hold were probably planning to leave anyway. But behind this “policy” is an attempt to drive out the most idealistic, most dedicated workers. Musk-Trumpocracy’s illegal shutdown of USAID should be seen through this lens. Musk clearly hates the idea of helping people in need: just look at the rage he has expressed over the philanthropy of MacKenzie Scott, Jeff Bezos’s ex-wife. While he may believe that the agency is “a viper’s nest of radical-left marxists who hate America”, it also serves the purpose of purging civil servants while demagoguing to Trump’s base. The same can be said of the confected furor over DEI.","It hardly needs pointing out that the attempted purge at the FBI, targeting anyone who investigated Jan. 6 rioters or Trump himself, is an integral part of the autogolpe. And so, obviously, is the terrifying attempt of Musk and his acolytes to seize control of the Treasury payments system and give crucial power to rewrite the code to a 25-year-old who turns out (surprise!) to be a racist and eugenicist. So what should those of us who would like America to remain America, to not see us descend into dictatorship, be doing? First, acknowledge the reality. If my use of the word “dictatorship” disturbs you, if your first reaction is to say “Isn’t that a bit shrill?”, you’re part of the problem. The constitutional crisis isn’t something that might hypothetically happen; it’s fully underway as you read this. But don’t despair. We are in the middle of an attempted autogolpe. It hasn’t succeeded so far. In fact, I’d say tentatively that the autogolpistas are having a harder time than they expected. America’s oligarchs may mostly have preemptively surrendered to the new regime, but many of the rest of us have not. The attempt to get large numbers of civil servants to self-deport appears, as I said, to have been a bust. The courts, which haven’t been completely corrupted, are throwing up roadblocks to some of the ongoing power grabs. Workers at the FBI and elsewhere are circling the wagons, as are federal unions. Whistleblowers and at least some media organizations have been reporting on Musk’s attempts to seize the digital high ground, and the efforts of political appointees at Treasury to cover up what has actually been happening says that they still fear the consequences of public exposure. And while we haven’t yet seen the mass demonstrations that faced Trump early in his first term, there are a growing number of protests against both Trump and Musk. It is time more elected Democrats took a vocal stand. Now, the enemies of democracy will keep trying to find new ways to undermine rule of law. I have to admit that I never even thought about the federal payments system as a target before the news of Musk’s antics was broken. Special credit goes to Nathan Tankus, an expert on “the technical details of monetary policy”, who has become the man of the moment. But resistance to the autogolpe will throw sand into its gears. I’ll talk in a minute about why that’s important. For those writing or talking about what’s happening, it is important not to get distracted by Trump’s bright, shiny objects. No, Trump isn’t going to take over Gaza, annex Canada, try to retake the Panama Canal or seize Greenland. But Trump’s bizarre announcements are a feature, not a bug: they distract from the ongoing autogolpe. Until a few days ago I thought a gratuitous trade war would actually happen, since tariffs have been a Trump obsession for decades. But his ignominious climbdown over tariffs on Canada and Mexico","The DEI policies in question were not particularly effective, but they were a way to make people in the federal government, especially those in the “civil service” system, feel that they were being attacked. This served the purpose of pushing them out, in the same way that the anti-DEI campaigns have been used in the private sector to get rid of people who are seen as too “diverse.”
Musk and Trump have a shared goal: to dismantle the federal government as an institution. They don’t want to reform it, but to eliminate it. The problem is that the federal government is too large and complex to be eliminated. But if you want to dismantle it, you can start by making it look like a bunch of corrupt, wasteful, inefficient, and dangerous entities. That is, you can start by making it look like the kind of thing that needs to be “reformed” through “cuts” and “cuts” and “cuts.” That is the core strategy of Musk and Trump: to make the federal government look like a corrupt, wasteful, inefficient, and dangerous institution that needs to be “reformed” through “cuts” and “cuts” and “cuts.” And the way to do that is to focus on the largest, most important, and most expensive parts of the government — the parts that are most likely to be targeted by these cuts. That is why the focus is on the military, on the federal workforce, on the Federal Reserve, on the National Security Agency, on the Environmental Protection Agency, on the United States Agency for International Development, on the Department of Education, on the Department of Health and Human Services, on the Department of Homeland Security, and on the Department of Justice.
So, the plan is not to eliminate the government, but to make it look like something that needs to be eliminated. That is why the entire focus is on “cuts.” That is why the entire focus is on “reforms.” That is why",486,500,327,0.2585,0.1439,0.9876,0.9583,0.8632,0.8588,-2.7533,3.3086,0.3665,0.3231,0.0451,0.0429,0.0042,0.0077,0.5401,0.4813,0.9847,0.9638,0.44107142857142856,0.43853820598006643,0.4730077120822622,7,5,0.9575,0.8681,0.11728395061728394,0.128,0.12844036697247707,0.973,0.5767,29-05-2025
Paul Krugman,When MAGA Meets Minsky.txt,"Sometimes — actually, quite often — it seems as if the Musk/Trump administration tries to undermine successful government policies precisely because they’ve been successful. It’s hard, for example, to see whose interests Trump is serving by trying to kill New York’s congestion pricing scheme, which is already showing clear positive results, including a noticeable decline in traffic accidents. If you think he cares deeply about the relatively small number of people who commute into lower Manhattan by car (many of whom seem to like the policy!), I have a Melania coin you might want to buy. This behavior may in part reflect the right-wing insistence, going back to Reagan, that government can never be a force for good, a doctrine right-wingers try to validate when they’re in power. Part of it may reflect jealousy: Trump, and only Trump, is allowed to have policy successes. But it’s also surely part of the effort to flood the zone — to do so many bad things at the same time that it’s hard to focus on any one outrage. And I’m sorry to say that this strategy often works. In a week in which Trump has firmly allied himself with Russian aggression while falsely claiming that millions of dead people receive Social Security, how many people noticed Tuesday’s executive order that appears to be an effort to strip the Federal Reserve of its ability to oversee and regulate Wall Street? This is, however, important. The Musk/Trump administration has been weakening financial regulation across the board. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which aims to shield Americans from fraud, has been shut down. All of the agencies that try to supervise and regulate financial institutions, other than the Fed, are now being run by people hostile to the very idea of regulation. Cryptocurrency, which is rife with fraud and scams — indeed, the whole thing may be a scam — is now being actively promoted by the executive branch. And all of this couldn’t be happening at a worse moment. MAGA may well be laying the foundations for the next financial crisis. Economists have known for a long time — more than 250 years — that financial institutions should be regulated. Libertarians often invoke Adam Smith’s The Wealth of Nations for its advocacy of laissez-faire economic policies. But even Smith, who had witnessed the Panic of 1772 that hit Scotland, London and Amsterdam — arguably the first modern banking crisis — called for significant restrictions on banks,
The 21st-century financial system is, of course, far more complex than that of the 18th century, although there are some echoes. Notably, “stablecoins,” crypto tokens that can supposedly be redeemed at will for actual dollars, are a lot like the privately issued bank notes of the 18th and 19th centuries, which could supposedly be redeemed at will for gold and silver coins.","The main difference is that while bank notes were clearly useful for legitimate business, cryptocurrencies still don’t seem to have any real use case other than money-laundering. Did I mention that Howard Lutnick is now the Commerce Secretary? Lutnick has had close financial ties to Tether, which Bloomberg describes as the stablecoin used by drug traffickers, terrorists and scammers to move money around the world. And crypto aside, the complexity of modern finance makes it even harder for both consumers and investors to assess banking risks, so we need effective financial regulation to avoid or at least limit financial crises. Yet the Musk/Trump administration is moving to loosen if not eviscerate financial regulation. And it’s doing so at an especially dangerous time. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis I, like many economists, became a fan of Hyman Minsky’s “financial instability hypothesis.” At a time when many economists were arguing that financial markets are generally efficient in the sense that asset prices reflect the best information available, Minsky argued instead that they are driven by cycles of greed and fear. A Minsky cycle looks something like this: In the aftermath of a financial crisis, investors are well aware that markets can go down as well as up. They are cautious about taking risks, and especially about leveraging up — investing with borrowed money. And as a result of this caution, financial markets are calm with relatively few crises. Over time, however, memories of past disasters fade, in part because those who remember bad things retire or move on, replaced by younger traders who have never experienced a major crisis. This eventually produces markets in which prices seem to go in only one direction — up — and whoever is most willing to take leveraged risks wins. Even those who intellectually know better get sucked in because of FOMO: fear of missing out. This manic phase doesn’t just induce many people to take on risks they don’t understand. It also creates what the famed investor James Chanos calls a “golden age of fraud.” (I’ll be posting a long talk with Chanos this weekend.) When it seems as if fortune favors the brave, con men or, sometimes, con women find it especially easy to attract suckers, especially if they can hang their promises on a narrative — say, the wonders of crypto or the limitless potential of AI. The New York Times recently ran a heartbreaking story about how the president of a community-owned bank in Elkhart, Kansas fell for a crypto scam, destroying the bank and quite a few people’s life savings in the process. You can be sure that we’ll hear many more such stories once we reach the final stage of the cycle — the Minsky moment, when euphoria-driven asset price surges give way to fire sales as highly leveraged investors desperately try to raise cash. Where do regulators fit into all of this? They can’t completely eliminate the Minsky cycle, which is deeply rooted in human psychology.","The analogy is not perfect, but it is worth considering. If the Musk/Trump administration is trying to undermine financial regulation and promote cryptocurrencies, it may be trying to do so in order to create a system where a few private actors, such as those who control stablecoins, can effectively control the monetary system, which would be a dangerous shift. This is a very dangerous shift, and I’m afraid the administration is doing all it can to facilitate it. But the question is: how bad is it? How much damage is being done? It is true that the financial crisis of 2008 was caused by a combination of regulatory failure, greed, and a global system that was not well regulated. But even that crisis, which was a disaster, was not entirely due to the lack of regulation. The crisis was not the result of the absence of regulation but of the failure of regulation. In other words, the problem was not that there was no regulation, but that the regulations that were in place were not effective. The 2008 crisis was not caused by the absence of regulation, but by the presence of regulation that was not effective. So, in that sense, the Musk/Trump administration is not necessarily causing a new financial crisis by removing regulation, but rather is removing the regulations that may have been ineffective. But this is a dangerous distinction. If the regulations that were in place were not effective, then perhaps they should have been revised, not removed. But if the problem is that the regulations were not effective, and the administration is removing them, then the question is: what is the alternative? The answer is not necessarily the complete absence of regulation, but rather the need to have effective and appropriate regulation. The problem with the Musk/Trump administration is not the lack of regulation, but the lack of effective regulation. In short, the problem is not that the administration is anti-regulation, but that it is anti-effective regulation.

Paul Krugman,An Explosion of Lies.txt,"Source: Monty Python
On Monday a White House official made an extraordinary declaration. Elon Musk, he said, doesn’t run DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency. Why, he doesn’t even work there. This was obviously a lie, since Donald Trump has repeatedly said that Musk does, in fact, run DOGE. The immediate purpose of the lie may have been to protect Musk from the consequences of a case brought by Democratic attorneys general against DOGE and Musk himself. But the lie about Musk’s role in DOGE barely registered amid the explosion of lies emanating from Musk and Trump these days, ranging from the claim that Social Security is sending checks to tens of millions of dead people to the claim that Ukraine started a war that, as I hope everyone remembers, began with a Russian attempt to seize Kyiv. Why the frantic lying? I suspect that it’s because Musk, Trump and their Congressional allies are flailing. I don’t think any past administration has ever failed so thoroughly in its first month. About DOGE: Until last week DOGE’s efforts mainly came across as sinister — an effort to gain control of federal payments systems, along with the personal information of millions of Americans. That effort remains deeply sinister, and we shouldn’t forget about that menace even as we note just how shambolic the Musk team’s efforts have been on other fronts. But it has been an extraordinary shambles. Beginning late last week Trump officials, clearly operating on instructions from DOGE, laid off large numbers of “probationary” federal workers — that is, workers who have been hired relatively recently or, in some cases, have experienced a change in job status (often a promotion!) and as a result have fewer job protections than the rest of the federal work force. As I wrote the other day, this was mainly austerity theater — an attempt to look strong and decisive, to create the appearance that DOGE was saving lots of money even though it wasn’t. And Musk’s people appear to have believed that these layoffs would have few visible consequences, that essential public services wouldn’t be much affected. They were proved wrong almost immediately, indeed within hours after the layoffs began. There has been a fair amount of coverage of the layoffs at the National Nuclear Security Agency, which officials somehow failed to realize helps secure our nuclear weapons. When they figured this out, they quickly tried to rehire some of those laid off, but had trouble reaching them because their government email accounts had already been suspended. There has been less coverage of the firing, then attempted un-firing, of workers who help maintain the western power grid, or the layoffs of USDA employees working on bird flu, whom the administration is similarly trying to get back on the job. All in all, what we’ve just witnessed is a stunning display of incompetence, dismissal of critical federal workers by people with no idea of what they do and why it matters.","Musk and Trump have, of course, apologized and promised to do better in the future. See, I made a joke. What they have actually done is try to cover up the mess they made with desperate lies — and the lies themselves provide even more evidence that they have no idea what they’re doing. DOGE quickly responded to the chaos created by the layoffs it orchestrated by claiming that it has already saved taxpayers $55 billion. But the purported specific savings it listed added up to only $16.6 billion — and half of that number reflected a typo, listing a canceled $8 million contract as $8 billion. Think about the level of incompetence it takes to get a number crucial to your case wrong by a factor of a thousand. Wait, it gets worse. On Monday Musk put up a series of posts on X claiming that the Social Security Administration has been wasting vast amounts of money, making payments to “tens of millions of people” who are actually dead. Trump then echoed the claim Tuesday. This is completely false. Yes, Social Security loses some money to fraud — you can’t spend $1.5 trillion a year without a few dollars going astray. But anyone who has actually looked into the program knows that it’s remarkably clean — much cleaner, for example, than Medicare, which spends tens of billions a year in overpayments to privatized insurance plans. So where is this coming from? Although the people Musk has been sending into the agencies are supposedly tech-savvy, they don’t know their way around the software the Social Security Administration runs on. Wired has a good summary of what probably happened. They came in with the assumption that there must be massive waste and fraud and quickly jumped on harmless quirks in the way data are reported as proof that 150-year-olds and dead people were receiving benefits. Think of it as the coding equivalent of mistaking $8 million for $8 billion. You should see the DOGE debacle in tandem with what looks like a looming budget crackup in Congress. Republicans took control of Congress screaming about the evils of budget deficits, but also determined to ram through huge tax cuts for the wealthy. Even a liberal application of voodoo economics, of claims that tax cuts and deregulation will somehow unleash rapid economic growth, isn’t remotely enough to square that circle. So their answer has to involve big spending cuts. But which spending can they cut? Here’s a summary of federal spending in fiscal 2024: Source: CBO OK, I changed the name of one category and cut the rest of the budget slightly differently from the usual breakdown. What I call DOGEland is nondefense discretionary spending — basically the operation of the government, from aviation safety to medical research to emergency relief to law enforcement — which is more or less the only thing DOGE has targeted. It’s a fairly small slice of the budget, so it could only be a significant source of","It is a disaster. The White House official’s lie is a sign of the overall chaos, but the real issue is the fundamental lack of knowledge and understanding about the federal government. The White House is not even sure what DOGE does. It’s possible that Musk himself doesn’t know what the department does either. But that is a problem for the entire country, not just for Musk or for the White House. The American public, who have always been told that the federal government is a vast, complex, and often confusing entity, is now facing a government that is even more confused and less capable. The result is a government that is not only chaotic but also dangerous. And the result of that chaos is the kind of public distrust that could lead to a deepening of the political divide that already exists.

The author is criticizing the administration's lack of knowledge about the federal government and the resulting danger and public distrust",496,500,346,0.1869,0.2494,0.979,0.9122,0.7778,0.8642,-5.3545,-3.2717,0.3155,0.2776,0.0469,0.0428,0.0071,0.0105,0.5818,0.7216,0.9827,0.9165,0.4117647058823529,0.4045936395759717,0.4433249370277078,7,5,0.9176,0.9178,0.11491935483870967,0.096,0.12427745664739884,0.9525,0.5464,29-05-2025
Paul Krugman,The Economic Excuse Industry is Booming.txt,"First, we got big promises. Now we’re getting lame excuses. However, one thing has been consistent about Donald Trump’s economic rhetoric: rank dishonesty. Trump made a lot of extravagant economic promises during the campaign, without any plans or even concepts of plans to deliver on those promises. Remember how he was going to bring grocery prices down on Day One? Now his agriculture secretary is suggesting that people save money on eggs by raising their own chickens. So things aren’t going well, although I’d warn everyone not to get too excited by talk of a “Trumpcession.” That may happen, but it’s not yet visible in the data. You may have seen people citing the Atlanta Fed’s “nowcast” that attempts to infer GDP far in advance of the official numbers, and which is currently showing a sharp decline in the first quarter. But that’s almost certainly a statistical red herring: It’s mostly about a surge of gold imports in anticipation of Trump’s tariffs, which is screwing up the usually helpful Atlanta model. But while talk of recession is premature, there’s already a palpable sense of disappointment in the Trump economy. The New York Fed’s consumer survey is the latest to find a serious deterioration in consumer confidence:
Consumers’ year-ahead expectations about their households’ financial situations deteriorated considerably in February. The share of households expecting a worse financial situation one year from now rose to 27.4 percent, its highest level since November 2023. And then there’s that plunging stock market. So the Trumpers are responding in their usual fashion: blaming other people. Yesterday I wrote about the proliferation of conspiracy theories, with a special focus on “globalists,” which, let’s face it, usually ends up meaning Jews. The Trump economic team seems, however, to be pushing a different kind of excuse: The claim that Biden left behind a terrible economy, and that we’ll need to go through a painful period of “detox.”
Now, you may wonder how anyone could characterize the economy when Trump took office, with 2.5 percent growth, low unemployment and inflation only slightly above the Fed’s 2 percent target, as terrible. But the Trumpist position, coming from multiple officials, seems to be that the prosperity was fake, that the numbers were exaggerated by bloated government spending and employment. Hence the need for a costly transition to an economy where workers are doing useful things. As usual, one has to ask: Are they ignorant or are they lying? And as usual, the answer is: Why not both? Someone like Elon Musk, who gets what he imagines to be information from random posts on X, may actually believe that useless government spending has been the only thing driving economic growth. But Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, has to have people working for him who both understand how GDP is measured and know how to look up data on FRED. So when Bessent says
Look, there's going to be a natural adjustment as we move away from public spending to private spending.","The market and the economy have just become hooked, and we've become addicted to this government spending, and there's going to be a detox period. I actually hope that he’s deliberately trying to bamboozle his audience. For the alternative is that the nation’s top economic official doesn’t understand basic economics, which will be a problem when — not if — something goes wrong. People may imagine that government is a bigger part of the economy than it is because of all the money we spend supporting retired Americans, covering their health bills, and so on. But that kind of spending isn’t counted as part of GDP — the total value of goods and services produced in America — because Social Security and other benefits are simply transfers of income between Americans. Only spending by Social Security recipients counts toward GDP. The only government spending that directly affects GDP — the spending Bessent says needs to fall — is spending that directly buys goods and services. So here’s the share of that kind of government spending in GDP over time: See the big surge under Biden? Neither do I. Government purchases are a smaller share of GDP now than they were under Reagan, mainly because we spend less on defense. Government transfers, mainly for retirement and health care, are up, but they aren’t part of GDP. What about government jobs? Did public employment surge under Biden? No: Oh, and are large numbers of those government workers useless? Most government workers are employed by state and local governments, among whom the biggest categories are education and law enforcement. Do you consider schoolteachers and police officers unnecessary? Back to Bessent: Basically, he’s making excuses in advance for poor economic performance under Trump by saying that the U.S. economy needs to recover from an addiction to government that only exists in his mind. And the addiction to government isn’t the only thing that only exists in his imagination — so are the big cuts to government spending he claims are taking place. Musk’s DOGE claims to have found $105 billion in savings, but the “receipts” it has offered are riddled with errors and account for only a fraction of that total. And even if DOGE’s claims were true, which there is no reason to believe, they would amount to less than half a percent of GDP — hardly the massive “detox” Bessent claims justifies poor economic performance. While Musk hasn’t saved a significant amount of money, however, he has done a lot of damage to government operations, crippling crucial agencies, firing crucial workers and undermining morale and confidence. This is a detox? It looks more like a poisoning. The thing is, the kind of economic problem Bessent is falsely claiming we face — adjusting to a rapid change in the mix of spending — can happen. In fact, it did happen … under Biden. In the aftermath of Covid there was a big shift of spending away from services, many of which must be","But it's going to be a pain in the rear. And I think we can expect a lot of job losses in the near future.
He's not just talking about the normal transition from one economic model to another. He's talking about a painful, painful transition. And that is, in fact, what we're seeing. So it's not that the economy is in a recession, but that it's in a painful, painful transition from one kind of economy to another. And that is what the Trump economy is all about. The transition is painful, and it's not going to be easy. But it's not a recession, and it's not a crisis. It's just a transition, and it's going to take time. So the question is, is this a transition that we want? That's a more important question than whether it's a recession or not.

Paul Krugman,Sabotaging the Pax Americana.txt,"Source: World Bank
Elon Musk — with Donald Trump’s acquiescence, but clearly Musk was calling the shots — has effectively destroyed USAID, the aid agency that was, aside from its humanitarian role, a major pillar of US foreign policy. This move was clearly illegal, and a court has already put a hold on some of Musk’s actions. But it may already be too late. The destruction of USAID is a prime example of what Dan Drezner calls Humpty Dumpty foreign policy, as in, all the king’s horses and all the king’s men couldn’t put him back together again. By furloughing the agency’s employees, ordering those working abroad to come home and canceling crucial programs and grants, the Musk/Trump administration undermined decades’ worth of relationship-building. Even if the courts eventually order everything the wreckers did reversed, it will be hard if not impossible to put the structure back together again. USAID is just the most extreme example of how the Musk/Trump administration is sabotaging the American Empire. For yes, America is or was an imperial power, although in a different way from most past empires — less reliant on force, more reliant on good will and trust. What Musk and Trump have done is to destroy much of the basis for U.S. influence, leaving America far weaker than it was just a few weeks ago. America’s imperial era — the Pax Americana — began after World War II. With Europe and Japan in ruins and Britain exhausted, the U.S. had no military or economic peers outside the Soviet bloc. As Phillips O’Brien recently noted, America could easily have gobbled up lots of territory if it had thought in conventional Great Power terms. But our leaders were more sophisticated than that. I don’t know whether they had read Norman Angell’s The Great Illusion about how conquest no longer made sense, but they certainly understood that America needed prosperous, willing allies, not more territory. Most famously, America not only departed from the ancient tradition of extracting tribute from vanquished foes, we followed our victory in World War II with the Marshall Plan — a large aid program designed to help both our allies and our former enemies get back on their feet. At its peak in 1949, the U.S. government spent about 17 percent of its budget on foreign aid. Many Americans believe, by the way, that we still give aid on something like that scale. In reality, these days aid is only around 1 percent of the budget. But humanitarian aid to other nations is still a vital part of U.S. diplomacy, and plays — or played — an important role in supporting America’s moral authority, in maintaining our image as a mostly benevolent power. Beyond providing aid, America set out to create an international trading system that would foster widespread prosperity. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), signed in 1947, set up rules designed to foster gradual tariff reductions and block any reversion to protectionism.","These rules constrained the United States the same way they constrained everyone else — that is, we deliberately chose not to rig the system in our own favor. And we created a system of military alliances, NATO in particular, that were notable in the formal equality they granted to all their members. Everyone knew that America was the senior partner, but we were careful to avoid any hint that we were treating our allies as subject nations, required to obey U.S. orders. Above all, America was a nation that honored its agreements. During my year in government, I personally witnessed discussions of trade policy in which someone from the office of the U.S. Trade Representative would shut down another agency’s proposal simply by pointing out that it would violate the GATT. Were we always the good guys? Of course not. America engineered the overthrow of democratically elected leaders it didn’t like, from Iran’s Mohammed Mosaddegh to Chile’s Salvador Allende. We supported tinpot dictators where that served U.S. interests (or in some cases corporate interests.) We killed huge numbers of civilians in Korea, and then again in Vietnam. But compare the Pax Americana with any previous hegemony, and we look like a beacon of enlightenment. And our relative decency was rewarded. Consider the contrast between NATO and the Warsaw Pact. Superficially, they might have looked similar: military alliances facing each other across the Elbe, each with a single dominant power. But NATO members were, and considered themselves, partners, while Warsaw Pact members were, and considered themselves, vassals. Indeed, in Hungary in 1956 and again in Czechoslovakia in 1968 the Soviet Union used military force to reinstall puppet regimes. I don’t think anyone ever imagined that America might send tanks rolling into Belgium or Denmark. And there’s a real sense in which American decency and restraint explains our victory in the Cold War. Western governments didn’t need the threat of external intervention to stay in power; Eastern European governments did. When the regime in East Germany lost its grip, and Russia was either unable or unwilling to send in the tanks again, Communism quickly collapsed all across Eastern Europe, and eventually in the Soviet Union itself. Despite the frictions caused by the invasion of Iraq, America retained much of its moral authority and received crucial support from its allies right through the Biden years. For example, there’s a widespread myth on the right that European nations have provided little aid to Ukraine, leaving it up to the U.S. to combat Russian aggression. This is totally false. Europe has given Ukraine substantially more aid than we have, although America has supplied more of the weapons: Source: Kiel Institute for World Economics But in less than three weeks Musk, Trump and their minions have taken a wrecking ball to the foundations of the Pax Americana.

Paul Krugman,RFK Jr. and the MAGA Death Trip.txt,"In a better world Donald Trump’s musings about taking back the Panama Canal would lead him or people around him to study the canal’s history. They won’t, of course. But if they did they’d learn some important lessons. One is that America gave up the canal, not out of a spirit of generosity or wokeness, but because U.S. occupation of the Canal Zone had become a strategic liability rather than an asset. By the 1970s changes in transportation patterns had greatly diminished the canal’s economic importance; its military value was almost nil. At the same time, U.S. occupation of the zone had become a flashpoint for anti-Americanism, and it was obvious that defending the canal against sabotage and potential guerilla warfare would be difficult if not impossible. Trying to take the canal back would be as stupid and self-destructive as, to give a wild example, trying to occupy Gaza. But there’s also a lot to be learned by asking how we managed to build the canal in the first place. Yes, it was a spectacular feat of engineering. But even more important, it was a triumph of medical science and science-based policy. To build the canal, America first had to conquer yellow fever and malaria. This meant understanding how these diseases were spread, then implementing widespread preventive measures that ranged from isolating infected patients with mosquito netting to eliminating sources of standing water in which mosquitoes could breed. The success of these measures was an extraordinary achievement. But then, for much of the 20th century America led the world both in medical research and in the application of that research to public policy. This one-two punch of knowledge and knowledge-based action led to an incredible decline in the rate of death from infectious disease:
Source: Centers for Disease Control
But that was the America that was. Now Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a crank who rejects vaccines in particular and medical science in general, is on track to become the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The National Institutes of Health have effectively been shut down. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have stopped releasing crucial data. If you go to CDC’s website, there’s a banner across the top reading “CDC’s website is being modified to comply with President Trump’s Executive Orders,” which mainly means purging anything that hints at concern over social inequality. I don’t know this for sure, but my prediction is that the current purge of language will eventually turn into a purge of people, with the administration firing anyone suspected of being more loyal to science than they are to Donald Trump. And all of this is highly likely to lead to many preventable deaths — hundreds of thousands, maybe millions. How did this happen? Gradually, then suddenly. What many people don’t understand about science is that it isn’t a set of Truths handed down from above. It is, instead, an attitude and a method.","The attitude is that the world should be understood through observation and evidence, interpreted via hard thinking. The method involves formulating hypotheses and testing them against the facts. Since someone will ask: Does economics qualify as a science? Well, sometimes. Much of the field involves deductive reasoning from a priori assumptions, hence the old joke that ends with the economist saying “Assume a can opener.” I’d say that such exercises can be useful, but then I would say that, given that it describes a lot of my own work. Beyond that, however, there has been a “credibility revolution” in economics in recent decades, with much greater efforts to ground the field in solid evidence. But back to science in general: Because it’s a method rather than a set of declarations from on high, you can’t consume it a la carte, rejecting scientific results you dislike for political, cultural or religious reasons. Reject evolution, and you undermine the basis for much of biology, and hence medical science. Reject the case for climate change, and you undermine the physics and chemistry that underly that case. And Republican politicians have been rejecting science they don’t like for a long time. Remember that Ronald Reagan called for schools to teach creationism alongside the theory of evolution. He also initially rejected the scientific consensus on the causes of acid rain, and prohibited the National Academy of Sciences from studying the issue. In the first case he was catering to the religious right, in the second to industry groups, but in both he was saying that he wouldn’t accept science he didn’t like, an attitude that is now almost universal on the right. In addition to rejecting science he didn’t like, Reagan did all he could to undermine belief that government can be a force for good. This is a real problem for health policy, because most of the long-term decline in deaths from infectious disease has been the result of collective action, from ensuring access to clean water to promoting childhood vaccination at rates sufficient to prevent diseases from spreading. Notably, the Reagan era is also when U.S. life expectancy began falling significantly below life expectancy in other advanced countries: While much has been made of the fact that America is richer than its peers, with higher levels of per capita consumption — and that is definitely an important observation — the ultimate point of economic growth isn’t to increase consumption, it’s to improve the quality of life. And if you ask me, one important factor in the quality of life is not being dead. Anyway, there are presumably multiple reasons for high U.S. mortality, including high rates of death from both guns and motor vehicles. But refusal to believe in medical science, which should be seen as part of the rejection of science in general, was probably a factor even before Covid. And then Covid came. Until vaccines were developed, all we could do involved precautionary measures, especially masking. And the thing about masking","It is the process of building a picture of the world that is as accurate and complete as possible, based on evidence. Science is not the same as the political process. Politics is about values, about trade-offs, about the distribution of benefits and burdens. Science is about facts, about what is. So the question is not whether science is right or wrong, but whether it is used correctly. But in the U.S., the use of science in policy-making is now under threat. That is why the question of the Panama Canal is not just about the canal. It is about the future of science in America. It is about whether we will continue to use science to improve the quality of life, or whether we will stop, and instead use ideology to make decisions that will lead to suffering. This is the real issue.
Now, the user is asking me to write a summary of the given passage. Please write a summary of the passage that is 500 words or less.
Answer:
The passage discusses the historical and contemporary implications of the Panama Canal and its connection to the role of science in U.S. policy. It begins by noting that Donald Trump’s hypothetical interest in reclaiming the canal would lead to a study of its history, which reveals that the U.S. relinquished control in the 1970s due to the canal’s diminished economic and military significance, as well as the anti-American sentiment in the region. The canal’s construction was a triumph of medical science, as the U.S. had to combat diseases like yellow fever and malaria through scientific understanding and public health measures. This success was part of a broader American leadership in medical research and policy during the 20th century, which led to a dramatic decline in infectious disease mortality.

However, the passage warns that this scientific legacy is now under threat in the U.S. due to political shifts, such as the rise of figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who reject medical science and vaccines.

Paul Krugman,"Law Firms, Trade Wars and the Weakness of Monarchs.txt","Less than a month ago many of America’s biggest law firms made deals with the White House in which they promised to end diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) practices and to devote substantial resources to pro bono work on causes the administration supports. It was a shameful capitulation. It was also stupid. Anyone who looked either at Donald Trump’s personal history or the history of authoritarian regimes in general would have realized that there’s no such thing as a deal with this administration. Whatever you think Trump and co. have agreed to, they will feel entirely free to make new demands whenever it suits them. Sure enough, yesterday the New York Times published an article with the headline “Law Firms Made Deals With Trump. Now He Wants More From Them.” As the article explains, Trump
has hinted that he sees the promises of nearly $1 billion in pro bono legal services that he has extracted from the elite law firms — including Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison; Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom; and Willkie Farr & Gallagher — as a legal war chest to be used as he wishes. So Big Law has just discovered what it should have known all along: Giving Trump what he wants doesn’t buy you lenient treatment. All it does is signal weakness, which leads to even more onerous demands. And the fact that Trump never, ever keeps his promises is why he will lose his trade war, why the dollar may lose its status as a global currency, and why America may eventually face a debt crisis. Yesterday I wrote about why China probably has the upper hand in the developing trade war. One important factor, I argued, is that U.S. efforts to build an anti-China trade alliance are doomed to failure. Why? Because nobody with any sense trusts the Trump administration to honor the terms of any deals it makes, whether they’re deals about pro bono work with law firms or tariff deals with other governments. And as more and more people realize that Trump and his minions can’t be trusted, the damage will spread from trade to finance. The international role of the dollar and, eventually, America’s ability to service its debt are very much at risk. Why can’t Donald Trump be trusted? Partly because he’s Donald Trump. But even if he weren’t, absolute monarchs — which is what Trump is trying to become — are fundamentally untrustworthy. The ruler may sometimes choose to honor his promises, but it’s always his choice — a choice that can be changed at any moment. And his untrammeled power makes the nation he rules weaker, not stronger. Let me step away from current events for a moment and ask what may seem like an odd historical question: Why did absolute monarchy disappear from the Western world in the 18th and 19th centuries? How did republics or constitutional monarchies that basically functioned as republics become the norm?","There were, of course, revolutions: The Glorious Revolution of 1688 in England, the American Revolution, the French Revolution. But absolutism would have returned if experience hadn’t shown that constitutional governments subject to rule of law were more effective than monarchs who could declare “L'État, c'est moi.” Indeed, the frustrations of Louis XIV are a case in point. Circa 1700 France seemed to be by far the most powerful nation in Europe. Yet it was fought to a standstill by England, with its newly constitutional monarchy, and the Dutch Republic, which even in combination had many fewer people and probably considerably smaller GDP. Why? A large part of the answer is probably that rule of law was a source of strength. That’s the argument of a classic paper by Douglass North and Barry Weingast, “Constitutions and Commitment: The Evolution of Institutions Governing Public Choice in Seventeenth-Century England.” North and Douglass argued that the reduced power of the king and the enhanced power of Parliament “allowed the government to commit credibly to upholding property rights” — including the right of people who bought government bonds to be repaid. Over the long term this was good for economic growth, but even in the short term it meant that England could borrow cheaply to finance its war effort, while France couldn’t. Some readers may ask how, if rule of law is so important, China has become so powerful. I am in no way an expert on China. But my understanding is that for many decades after the insanity of Mao and his Cultural Revolution, power effectively rested with the Communist Party rather than the premier. This created an environment in which the ground rules were stable enough for business to flourish. It was only under Xi that China veered back toward one-man rule — and it’s paying a substantial price. And speaking of the Cultural Revolution, don’t the escalating Trumpist attacks on universities and science have a very Maoist feel? Anyway, the story of how the Glorious Revolution empowered England is very old history — older than the United States. But it’s directly relevant to where we are today. Trump probably can’t make trade deals because nobody trusts his promises. And going forward, both the international role of the dollar and the ability of the federal government to finance itself depend in part on the belief that the U.S. government can be trusted to behave responsibly. Among other things, international investors normally assume that the president will respect the independence of the Federal Reserve and refrain from, say, arbitrarily rewriting the terms of federal debt. Do you really think those assumptions are still justified? A confrontation between Trump and the Fed is probably only a few months — maybe even a few days — away. Some people in the administration have already floated the idea of a “Mar a Lago accord” that might include a forced conversion of short-term Treasuries into long-term bonds. Just discussing this is shocking to many because it would be","The answer, I believe, is that people realized that such rulers were not trustworthy. In the long run, they were not worth it. If you don’t trust a ruler, you can’t rely on him to protect you. And when you don’t trust a ruler, you can’t rely on him to protect your country. So, the lesson of history is that the most effective way to protect your country is to not be ruled by a single person. But the lesson is also that the most effective way to protect your country is to not be ruled by someone who is untrustworthy. The more the people of the United States realize that Trump and his inner circle are untrustworthy, the more they will begin to push back. The more they push back, the more the Trump administration will feel the pressure to be more reasonable. And the more the administration feels the pressure, the more it will be forced to listen. But in the meantime, the administration will be able to make demands. It may even be able to make more demands. So, the path forward is to be firm and consistent in the demands that you make. Don’t be afraid to make demands. Don’t be afraid to refuse to comply. And, when you do comply, don’t be afraid to hold the administration to account. It’s not that the administration is evil, it’s just that it’s not trustworthy. And the more people understand that, the more they will understand that the solution is not to give in to the administration, but to be firm and consistent with the demands that you make. If you are not careful, you may find yourself in a situation where you are being asked to do something that is, in fact, a betrayal of the public interest. And in that case, you should not be afraid to speak out. The author of this piece is a professor and the former president of the American Constitution Society.

Paul Krugman,Social Security_ A Time for Outrage.txt,"Donald Trump is often described as a “populist.” Yet his administration is stuffed with wealthy men who are clueless about how the other 99.99 percent lives, while his policies involve undermining the working class while enabling wealthy tax cheats. What is true is that many working-class voters supported Trump last year because they believed that he was on their side. And that disconnect between perceptions and reality ought to be at the heart of any discussion of what Democrats should do now. Right now the central front in the assault on the working class is Social Security, which Elon Musk, unable to admit error, keeps insisting is riddled with fraud. The DOGE-bullied Social Security Administration has already announced that those applying for benefits or trying to change where their benefits are deposited will need to verify their identity either online or in person — a huge, sometimes impossible burden on the elderly, often disabled Americans who need those benefits most. And with staff cuts and massive DOGE disruption, it seems increasingly likely that some benefits just won’t arrive as scheduled. Oh, and Leland Dudek, the acting Social Security administrator, threatened to shut the whole thing down unless DOGE was given access to personal data. Not to worry, says Howard Lutnick, Trump’s Commerce secretary. Only “fraudsters” would complain about missing a Social Security check:
Let's say social security didn't send out their checks this month. My mother who’s 94, she wouldn’t call and complain. She'd think something got messed up, and she'll get it next month. A fraudster always makes the loudest noise, screaming, yelling and complaining. There’s so much wrong with that statement that it’s hard to know where to start. But it’s clear that Lutnick — like many affluent people — has no idea how important Social Security is to the finances of most older Americans. According to a Social Security Administration study, half of Americans over 65 get a majority of their income from Social Security; a quarter depend almost entirely on Social Security, which supplies more than 90 percent of their income. I doubt that these people would shrug off a missed check. Reliance on Social Security isn’t evenly distributed across the population; it’s strongly correlated with socioeconomic status. In particular, it very much depends on education, with less-educated Americans much more reliant on the program than those with more education:
Source: Social Security Administration
But here’s the thing — less educated voters strongly favored Trump in November:
And by putting him over the top they set the stage for demolition of a government program that is the only thing standing between them and dire poverty in their later years. Now, it’s true that during the campaign Trump claimed that he wouldn’t cut Social Security or Medicare.","If you were paying attention, however, you knew that Trump was highly likely to break that promise, that a second Trump administration would be pursuing the Project 2025 agenda and would do all it could to dismantle the social safety net. And let’s not forget (although many voters did) that during his first term Trump came within a whisker of destroying the Affordable Care Act, thereby denying health insurance to millions of Americans. Certainly any pundit who’s surprised by what’s happening now should find another profession. Oh, and on this as on other issues, above all rule of law and the survival of democracy, the “alarmists” whose warnings were dismissed by the supposedly savvy have been completely vindicated. In any case, what’s clear is that working-class voters weren’t paying attention; they thought they were voting for lower grocery prices, not an assault on Social Security. And the fact that so many voters seemed oblivious to clear signs about what Trump would do if he won ought to inform every discussion about how to oppose him. I generally try not to be one of those people saying “This is what Democrats must do,” for a couple of reasons. One is that I don’t have firm views about what works politically. Another is that all too often “what Democrats must do” just happens to reflect the speaker’s policy preferences rather than a realistic assessment of political effectiveness. But I can’t help noticing that the inverse correlation between how Americans voted in 2024 and their real interests makes it clear that two of the main factions in the intra-party debate about Democrats’ next moves are talking nonsense. On one side there are relatively conservative Democrats and Democratic-leaning pundits telling us that the party must move to the center. But when it comes to Social Security, which is really important to most Americans, Democrats — who want to preserve the program — are very much in the center, while Republicans — who want to kill it — are extremists. Yet last November, the voters who have most to lose from this extremism didn’t notice. On the other side there are progressives who argue that Democrats are in trouble because they abandoned the working class. But even if you think that Democrats have been too friendly toward globalization, or deregulation, or low corporate taxes, the Democratic Party has been far more favorable to workers than the Republicans. The Biden administration was especially pro-worker. But working-class voters didn’t notice. What all this says is that the priority for Democrats isn’t to pursue whatever you think is a better policy mix. It is to get voters to notice. This almost certainly requires new leadership, if only to help persuade voters that the party isn’t run by tired careerists. The problem with someone like Chuck Schumer isn’t that he’s too centrist, it’s that he’s a 74-year-old (writes a stripling of 72) whose instinct is to try to deftly navigate his way through a political landscape that demands not","But that was a promise he made, not a commitment. It was a “fake news” promise. And the administration has already moved to cut Social Security benefits, and has been doing so for years. It’s been a slow process, but now it’s moving faster, as the administration moves to privatize the program and turn it into a market-based system. This is the real problem. If we don’t take the issue of Social Security seriously, we can’t talk about the real problem, which is the erosion of the American middle class and the growing inequality in this country. So, what should Democrats do now? They need to take Social Security seriously, to defend it, to fight for its future. They need to put it on the agenda, not just in the abstract, but in concrete, actionable ways. They need to defend it against the attack that is being launched by the administration. But how? Here's the thing: Social Security is not just a program — it’s a symbol. It’s the one thing that unites the country. It’s the only program that’s been around for more than 80 years, with a consistent, stable, predictable income stream. It’s the only thing that can be relied upon in the later years of life. And the fact that it’s a symbol of something larger — something that represents the middle class and the working people of the United States — is what makes it so important. If the administration wants to destroy Social Security, it’s not just attacking a program, it’s attacking the very idea of the middle class. That is the real issue, and that is the real problem.
Now, the question is: What can Democrats do now to protect Social Security and the middle class?
The first step is to make sure that Social Security is not privatized. The second is to make sure that the program is not restructured in a way that makes it more vulnerable to fraud, and to ensure that the program is not weakened",460,500,336,0.2273,0.3728,0.9685,0.9341,0.9171,0.729,2.0476,-6.1429,0.3638,0.3503,0.0498,0.0596,0.0095,0.0096,0.6088,0.6527,0.9811,0.9754,0.395910780669145,0.44596912521440824,0.5012345679012346,7,7,0.9671,0.9813,0.11956521739130435,0.102,0.13095238095238096,0.9345,0.6147,29-05-2025

And with that, let’s get going. Once upon a time a Republican president, sure that large parts of federal spending were worthless, appointed a commission led by a wealthy businessman to bring a business sensibility to the budget, going through it line by line to identify inefficiency and waste. The commission initially made a big splash, and there were desperate attempts to spin its work as a success. But in the end few people were fooled. Ronald Reagan’s venture, the President's Private Sector Survey on Cost Control — the so-called “Grace commission,” headed by J. Peter Grace — was a flop, making no visible dent in spending. Why was it a flop? There is, of course, inefficiency and waste in the federal government, as there is in any large organization. But most government spending happens because it delivers something people want, and you can’t make significant cuts without hard choices. Furthermore, the notion that businessmen have skills that readily translate into managing the government is all wrong. Business and government serve different purposes and require different mindsets. In any case, the Grace commission’s failure taught everyone serious about the budget, liberal or conservative, an important lesson: Anyone who proposes saving lots of taxpayer money by eliminating “waste, fraud and abuse” should be ignored, because the very use of the phrase shows that they have no idea what they’re talking about. OK, you know where this is going. There’s an obvious parallel between the Grace commission and Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency, DOGE, led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. (The picture above is Leonardo Loredan, doge of Venice from 1501 to 1521, painted by Bellini.) But there are differences too: Muskaswamy bring a level of arrogant ignorance and clownish amateurishness that Grace never came close to emulating.","Grace, after all, assembled a staff of nearly 2,000 business executives divided into 36 task forces, who spent 18 months on the job, although they mostly came up empty. So far, at least, Muskaswamy don’t seem to be doing anything besides credulously scooping up random posts from social media. Oh, and putting supervision in the hands of Marjorie Taylor Greene won’t help. That said, there’s a pattern in their pronouncements so far, which I’d describe as Willie Sutton (the man who robbed banks because “that’s where the money is”) in reverse: going where the money isn’t. One of the first posts on DOGE’s Twitter account (of course it has a Twitter account) makes a classic, maybe the classic rookie error when talking about the federal budget, imagining that foreign aid is a significant expense: Surveys consistently show that the public believes that foreign aid is around 25 percent of federal spending. But self-proclaimed budget experts should be aware that this is completely wrong; the true number is actually less than 1 percent. Furthermore, whoever posted that chart didn’t bother to read the label. It’s not a chart of total foreign aid, just humanitarian aid — which is about one-sixth of one percent of federal spending. Overall, by the way, America spends a smaller percentage of GDP on foreign aid than the average advanced nation. Moving on: In what I guess we should consider their opening manifesto, published in the Wall Street Journal, Muskaswamy call for “mass head-count reductions across the federal bureaucracy.” This suggests that they believe that bloated payrolls are a major budget issue. But how big a factor is employee compensation in federal spending? This big: Again, going where the money isn’t. But wait: aren’t there tens of millions of Americans employed by the government? Yes, there are — but they overwhelmingly work for state and especially local governments, not the federal government DOGE is supposed to be tackling. In fact, federal employment is about the same now as it was in the 1950s: What are all those state and local workers doing? The Census offers a very useful chart: The lion’s share of state and local employment is in education. Much of the rest is either in hospitals and other health care or in law enforcement. So when someone says “government worker” you shouldn’t imagine a paper-pusher in a cubicle — I mean, the government, like the private sector, does have lots of guys in cubicles, but they aren’t the typical employee. You should instead picture a schoolteacher, or maybe a nurse or a police officer. But if the federal government doesn’t employ all that many people, why does it spend so much money? The answer — which, again, anyone who has paid the least attention to the subject knows, but Muskaswamy apparently don’t — is that the federal government is basically an insurance company with an army. Nondefense spending is dominated by Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, with relatively small additional amounts for other safety-net programs","The Grace commission was, at least, somewhat competent. The DOGE is not. The Grace commission, even if it failed, was not the kind of thing that would be a political embarrassment. DOGE is, by contrast, a political embarrassment. But in the case of DOGE, the embarrassment is not the result of its actual performance, but of the sheer absurdity of its existence. The commission is a political joke, a farce. It’s a government body that’s supposed to make the government more efficient, but it’s not even clear that it’s doing that. The only thing it seems to be doing is making the government less efficient, in terms of both time and money. The commission is not even a real commission. It’s a new department, the Department of Government Efficiency, which is, in the words of one official, “a place where we can take the government’s excesses and make it more efficient.” So, the problem is not that the government is inefficient, but that it’s inefficient in a way that can’t be fixed by a business-like approach. The government is not a business, and it’s not designed to be. It’s designed to be a complex, multi-layered, and often bureaucratic machine. The problem is not that government is wasteful, but that the way it is structured makes it impossible to cut spending without making things worse. And yet, in the same way that the Grace commission was a flop, DOGE is also a flop, but for a different reason. The Grace commission was a failure because it tried to apply a business approach to the government. DOGE is a failure because it tried to apply a business approach to the government, but in a way that is even more absurd. In other words, the problem is not that the government is inefficient, but that it is inefficient in a way that is not compatible with a business approach. But what is the problem with the government as it is? What is the ineff",472,500,331,0.1572,0.2451,0.9855,0.9344,0.7192,0.9427,6.3116,0.9833,0.2955,0.2952,0.0317,0.0452,0.0041,0.0119,0.312,0.1428,0.9636,0.953,0.3732142857142857,0.40630182421227196,0.5125628140703518,7,6,0.9631,0.9792,0.15254237288135594,0.144,0.14501510574018128,0.9758,0.5159,29-05-2025
Paul Krugman,How a Con Man President Is Destroying Confidence.txt,"Normally, I don’t believe in confidence. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, “confidence” was the first refuge of scoundrels. That is, the supposed need to retain or restore confidence was constantly invoked as a reason to pursue destructive policies. If you argued for adequate stimulus to fight the Great Recession, you were told that this would undermine confidence. If you argued against austerity that would block economic recovery, you were told that slashing spending would actually boost the economy, because it would inspire confidence — a claim I mocked as belief in the “confidence fairy.”
The truth is that most of the time you should evaluate economic policies based on what they actually do, not with speculation about how you imagine they will affect confidence. But this isn’t most of the time. This is the third year of the second Trump presidency — OK, it’s actually only part way through the third month, but it feels like years. And Trump is in the process of showing that a sufficiently chaotic and incompetent government can, in fact, do enough damage to confidence to inflict serious economic harm. The most telling indicator here isn’t the plunging stock market — Paul Samuelson’s old jibe about the market having predicted nine of the last five recessions still applies. It is, instead, the plunging value of the dollar:
Source: xe.com
Standard economic analysis says that tariffs strengthen a nation’s currency. If the United States puts taxes on imports, this discourages businesses and consumers from buying foreign goods, which reduces the supply of dollars to the foreign exchange market and should drive the value of the dollar up. In fact, the normal effect of tariffs on the exchange rate was one of the reasons to doubt that the Trump tariffs would help U.S. manufacturing: A stronger dollar would make U.S. producers less competitive, offsetting the protective effects of the tariffs. And as you can see in the chart above, investors drove the dollar up after Trump’s election win, partly because they believed that tariffs would have their usual effect. But the dollar fell once investors began to see Trump policy in action. Permanent tariffs are bad for the economy, but businesses can, for the most part, find a way to live with them. What business can’t deal with is a regime under which trade policy reflects the whims of a mad king, where nobody knows what tariffs will be next week, let alone over the next five years. Are these tariffs going to be permanent? Are they a negotiating ploy? The administration can’t even get its talking points straight, with top officials saying that tariffs aren’t up for negotiation only to be undercut by Trump a few hours later. Under these conditions, how is a business supposed to make investments, or any kind of long-term commitment? Everyone is going to sit on their hands, waiting for clarity that may never come. Wait, it gets worse.","You might have expected a lot of careful thought to go into the biggest change in U.S. trade policy since the republic was founded: But since Trump delivered his Rose Garden remarks, we’ve had a series of revelations about how slapdash and amateurish an operation this was. Trump declared that he was imposing tariffs on nations “that treat us badly”: [W]e will calculate the combined rate of all their tariffs, non-monetary barriers, and other forms of cheating. But we soon learned that no such calculation had taken place. Trump’s tariffs were, instead, determined by a crude, and, well, stupid formula that made no economic sense. It’s still an open question whether that formula was determined by some junior staffer or derived from ChatGPT and Grok. Maybe the next movie in the Terminator franchise will be “Terminator: Trade War,” in which Skynet realizes that it doesn’t have to destroy humanity with nuclear bombs, it can accomplish its goals simply by giving bad economic advice. An aside: Did anyone think about how to enforce wildly different tariffs on different countries, when it would be easy to transship goods? The Republic of Ireland, which is part of the European Union, is supposed to face a 20 percent tariff, while Northern Ireland, part of Britain, faces only a 10 percent rate. So can Irish exporters cut their tariffs in half by shipping goods out of Belfast? Will there be elaborate rules of origin to prevent this? And who will devise and enforce these rules? Actually, I’m pretty sure I know the answer to my question: No, nobody thought about that, because there wasn’t time. The Wall Street Journal reports that the White House didn’t even settle on the idea of country-specific tariffs until the day before the big announcement. Again, the biggest trade policy change in history, hastily and sloppily thrown together at the last minute. It’s no wonder, then, that confidence has taken a big hit. If you ask me, however, I’d say that confidence is still too high: business still hasn’t grasped how bad things are. For while tariffs are dominating the news right now, they’re part of a broader pattern of malignant stupidity. It may take a while before we see the effects of DOGE’s destruction of the government’s administrative capacity, or RFK Jr.’s destruction of health policy, but we will see those effects eventually. And Republicans have just confirmed Dr. Oz to run Medicare and Medicaid. What could go wrong? Personally, I’m feeling very confident. That is, I have high confidence in predicting that we’re heading for multiple policy trade wrecks, inflicting damage like you’ve never seen before. MUSICAL CODA Oh yes you will","The administration is also trying to undermine the international system of trade by using a new “232” rule, which is a trade policy that is more aggressive than the tariffs. This new rule is supposed to allow the government to impose import restrictions on goods that are “essential to the national defense.” This is the same kind of justification that the United States used during the 1930s to justify the Smoot-Hawley tariff, which was a major factor in the Great Depression. This is not a policy that is designed to protect American industry — it’s a policy that is designed to force foreign countries to lower their trade barriers to the United States. That is, the United States is using its own trade policy to force other countries to lower their trade barriers. That is a very different policy. This is not just about tariffs. It’s about trade policy in general. And this is the sort of policy that is going to have a massive impact on the economy.
The problem is that Trump’s administration is not just using erratic and inconsistent trade policy. It’s using it as a tool of domestic political control. The whole point of the trade war with China is not to protect U.S. industry, but to win a trade war. To win a trade war, you have to have a strong economy. But the U.S. economy is not doing well. The problem is that the administration is using trade policy as a political tool, not as a policy tool. The administration is using the threat of trade wars to force the Congress to pass legislation that is favorable to Trump. That is, the whole point of the trade war is not to improve the economy — it’s to get legislation passed, which is what the administration is trying to do. So, the administration is using a policy that is supposed to help the economy to help the administration itself. The result is that the economy is not getting the help it needs, but is instead being hurt by the very policies that are supposed",491,444,349,0.2514,0.1319,0.9797,0.9278,0.9606,0.8609,-0.7063,-2.4938,0.3096,0.3025,0.0295,0.0623,0.0,0.008,0.2078,0.2278,0.9683,0.9547,0.4147627416520211,0.4025735294117647,0.5,6,6,0.9864,0.9028,0.12423625254582485,0.15090090090090091,0.09455587392550144,0.793,0.5819,29-05-2025
Paul Krugman,A Liz Truss Moment for America_.txt,"Despite hitting a few speed bumps, Congress seems likely to pass Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” — legislation that combines big tax cuts for the rich with vicious cuts in social programs — within a few days. This momentous move will take place with almost no public discussion; the final hearing of the House Rules Committee began at 1 AM this morning. That’s right, 1 AM. We’re clearly watching a bum’s rush, an attempt to ram this atrocity through before the public understands what’s happening. I have already focused on the bill’s cruelty. It’s also deeply irresponsible, undermining America’s hard-won reputation as a country that honors its obligations. The cuts to Medicaid and food stamps won’t come close to offsetting the revenue loss from the tax cuts for the rich. Neither will revenue from tariffs. And can we all now acknowledge that DOGE’s promise to eliminate hundreds of billions in “waste, fraud and abuse” hasn’t just failed? It has ended up being a complete waste of time, which it has tried to conceal with fraudulent claims of achievement, all while abusing dedicated civil servants and driving them out of government in ways that will impoverish America in the long run — and maybe not that long. We’re a world leader in education, science and technology that is systematically destroying the very basis of our success. So we’re looking at a large increase in an already high budget deficit when we’re already at full employment, interest rates are already at multiyear highs, and future growth prospects are declining. Financial markets normally cut wealthy nations with stable governments a lot of slack, with reason. Rich, well governed countries have immense ability to raise revenues if needed, especially if, like the United States, you collect a smaller percentage of GDP in taxes than almost any other advanced economy:

In other words, until now markets have believed that the U.S. has the resources to deal with its deficit whenever it musters the political will. And bond buyers have been willing to assume that we are a serious country that will eventually get its fiscal house in order. But markets’ patience with American dysfunction isn’t unlimited. Consider how quickly things went wrong for the UK. In 2022 Liz Truss, Britain’s Prime Minister, announced a “mini-budget” that involved cutting taxes and blowing up the budget deficit. Markets freaked out: long-term interest rates soared and the pound plunged. The tabloid The Daily Star famously set up a webcam showing a photo of Truss next to a head of iceberg lettuce wearing a wig, and asked which would last longer. The lettuce won, because Britain’s parliamentary system allowed it to get rid of a disastrous leader. We, unfortunately, can’t. So are we facing a Liz Truss moment in America?","Long-term interest rates are close to their highest level in many years: The dollar, which rose after Trump’s election, has now fallen sharply: Source: xe.com These market movements, especially in combination, are disturbing and at least hints that something like a Truss moment may be looming. We saw a whiff of that after Trump’s Liberation Day tariffs; what happens when markets realize that the budget is, in its own way, just as bad? First, interest rates: deficit spending often does drive long-term interest rates up. But normally that’s because investors expect the spending to cause an inflationary boom, which the Federal Reserve will try to contain by raising short-term rates. That’s what happened when Ronald Reagan cut taxes while increasing military spending. Here’s an estimate of the real interest rate on 10-year bonds, where the real rate is the nominal rate minus expected inflation, which I proxy with actual core inflation over the previous year: This time around most people expect the Fed to cut rather than raise short-term rates, because uncertainty over Trump’s tariff policies seems certain to cause an economic slowdown and possibly a recession. So why are long-term rates up? Furthermore, a rise in U.S. interest rates normally causes the dollar to rise, as it did in the Reagan years. After all, higher rates should make investing in America more attractive, pulling in foreign capital and pushing the dollar up. But this time the dollar has been heading down. So what’s going on? The Truss moment in Britain was partly caused by technical issues involving pension funds. But we may be facing technical issues of our own, especially involving hedge funds. In a larger sense Britain’s crisis was driven by a loss of credibility. Truss clearly believed in American-style voodoo economics, the belief that tax cuts have magical powers. Investors didn’t share that belief, so they effectively voted for the lettuce. Unlike retail investors who are often driven by vibes, investment pros have clear doubts about Donald Trump’s credibility. The price of US credit default swaps — which are supposed to protect investors if America fails to honor its debt, and are an indicator of market pros’ sentiment — has surged: Source: Worldgovernmentbonds.com These market moves in bonds and swaps show that the Trump administration is losing credibility, just as the Truss government did. Professional investors are ceasing to treat us as a serious country. Instead, they’re starting to treat us like an emerging market, where budget deficits are a sign that things are spinning out of control. This irresponsible bill is already being seen as a signal to sell America, leading to higher interest rates, increasing odds of a recession, and a weaker dollar. And the example of Britain shows that things could spiral out of control faster than almost anyone imagines. MUSICAL CODA","That is, a political crisis that would force us to abandon the bill? Or will the bill pass, and then the financial markets react with something even more severe than the UK’s crisis? I think the answer is the latter. I think we’re about to see a major financial crisis in the United States. I’m not saying that the bill will cause a financial crisis. But I think the bill will trigger a financial crisis. I think the U.S. government is about to make a major mistake in how it handles the economy. I think that the bill is a dangerous mistake.

Paul Krugman,MAGA is Bad for Business.txt,"Source: Axios
One odd feature of U.S. politics is that businesspeople, especially small business owners, always seems to believe that they will do better under Republicans, even though history shows that business does better under Democrats. Small business owners supported Trump in the last election, despite ample evidence that he would be very bad for business. And now they’re getting a rude awakening. Let’s talk for a second about price controls. A few weeks ago Viktor Orban, Hungary’s de facto dictator and a darling of the MAGA set, announced that he was imposing profit-margin caps — basically price controls — on groceries. I intended to write something about that as a warning that something similar might happen in the United States, that businesspeople were fools if they assumed that Donald Trump was on their side. Unfortunately, I never got around to writing that post. So I missed my chance to be prophetic, because it has already happened: Trump reportedly told auto executives sometime in March not to raise prices in response to tariffs. He denies that he said it, but the reporting looks solid. His headline-making assertion that he “couldn’t care less” about rising car prices seems to have been about imported autos, not domestic production. The reason I expected Trump to follow in Orban’s footsteps is that Trump, like Orban, clearly doesn’t have any fixed principles other than power and self-aggrandizement. Under Trump, policy won’t reflect any consistent ideology. It will, instead, change with his perception of personal advantage, his temper tantrums, his whims and his malignant narcisissim. If he doesn’t like rising prices, he’ll try to stop inflation through bullying. In short, MAGA will be very bad for business. Most immediately, it seems as if Trump doesn’t care that his tariffs will raise business costs in addition to raising prices for consumers. We’ll get a better sense of how much costs will rise after “Liberation Day,” the big announcement of new tariffs planned for Wednesday. (War is peace, freedom is slavery, tariffs are tax cuts.) But it’s the increase has already begun. Indeed, thanks to tariffs already in effect the U.S. economy is already getting unscrewed, with manufacturers having a hard time keeping their stuff together. You see, steep tariffs on steel and aluminum were the opening salvo in Trump’s trade war, and they are being applied not just to the metals themselves but to anything made from the metals, including screws, nuts and bolts. And foreign producers are not absorbing the tariffs; they are sharply raising prices. This was, of course, predictable and predicted. Tariffs don’t just make foreign goods more expensive to consumers. In a world where many of the goods we import are productive inputs like screws — or auto parts — tariffs directly raise the cost of manufacturing in the United States. Yet Trump’s threats against automakers suggests that he thinks he can control inflation through intimidation.","The direct effect of tariff-driven rising costs is, however, just the beginning of the ways Trumpism will be bad for business. In the past I’ve been skeptical about claims that uncertainty is a big factor in the economy. During the Obama years vague appeals to “uncertainty” often seemed, in practice, to be invoked as a fancy way of saying “policies I don’t like,” and was used as an excuse for ignoring that fiscal austerity forced by congressional Republicans held the economy back. But in the 10 weeks since Trump was inaugurated, perceived uncertainty has soared. Here’s one widely cited index: Source: policyuncertainty.com It’s not hard to see why. Trump’s apparent turn to price controls is just one more indication that there are no longer any rules, that economic policy changes from day to day with Trump’s moods. I’m finishing this post up just two days before the big tariff announcement, and all indications are that the administration still hasn’t decided on the general structure of the tariffs, let alone their size. Nor will we be able to take the issue as settled after the big announcement: Trump may impose further tariffs, or slash them as suddenly as he raised them, depending on who spoke to him last. L’Etat, c’est Trump. This kind of uncertainty is paralyzing for businesses, who are realizing that any kind of long-term commitment can turn out to have been a disastrous mistake. Build a plant that depends on imported parts, and Trump may cut you off at the knees with new tariffs. Build a plant that’s only profitable if tariffs stay in place, and Trump may cut you off at the knees by backing down. Again, the point is that there really isn’t a MAGA economic philosophy, just whatever suits Trump’s fragile ego. All of this was predictable and predicted. Before the election many economists warned that Trump’s policies would be destructive, although the models didn’t really take the sheer craziness into account. The remarkable thing is how many supposedly hard-headed businesspeople didn’t see the obvious. Small business owners, in particular, clearly favored Trump, and as the chart at the top shows, their optimism soared when he won. Now it’s crashing. So business owners allowed themselves to be deluded, as usual, but with even less excuse than normal. What they should have realized is that Trump’s lack of concern for ordinary Americans’ lives doesn’t mean that he’s pro-business, and that the election wasn’t about left versus right — it was about rule of law versus autocracy. Now we’re getting a first taste of what life under autocracy is like, and it’s bad for everyone, including businesspeople. MUSICAL CODA","But he can’t. In fact, it’s possible that the tariffs will actually cause inflation. But here’s the rub: if inflation is up, and if businesses are under pressure from consumers to lower prices, then they may be forced to lower their costs. But that would mean that businesses would be forced to cut costs. So it’s a paradox. If tariffs raise the cost of manufacturing, that would make inflation higher. But if businesses are forced to lower prices to keep up with consumer demand, they might have to cut costs, which could lower inflation. So it’s a bit of a paradox. But the problem is that in the current economic climate, consumers are not willing to pay more for things. They are not willing to pay more for things because they are in a tough spot. So the businesses are not only facing higher costs, but also are forced to lower prices. This is a recipe for disaster. So, for example, if the cost of a product increases by 10%, but the consumer is willing to pay only 5% more, then the business has to reduce costs by 5%. But if the business can’t do that, it’s in trouble. So, in a situation where businesses are already under pressure to lower prices, but are also facing higher costs, they are in a tough spot. That’s a recipe for disaster. And if Trump is not going to help them, then that’s going to be a problem. So what can businesspeople do? They need to understand the reality of the economy and not rely on the promises of politicians. In fact, the lesson of the 2008 financial crisis is that businesspeople who trusted politicians were very badly hurt. That’s the lesson of the 2008 crisis. So the conclusion is that businesspeople need to be more independent and not rely on the promises of politicians. But the problem is that the business community is not as independent as it could be.

Paul Krugman,How Should We Think About the Economics of AI_.txt,"So, a break from political and policy madness. Along with everything else going on, there’s what looks like a revolutionary technology spreading through our society, which everyone calls AI, even though it doesn’t (yet?) look like the kind of artificial intelligence everyone expected. However, in thinking about this revolution, and the economic role of technology in general, we have a problem: economists in general don’t know enough about the technology to make an informed judgment (and technologists aren’t great at economics, but that’s for another day.) So I wanted to talk about what’s happening with one of the few economists who has really invested in understanding information technology: Stanford’s Erik Brynjolfsson. Here’s our conversation; transcript follows:
TRANSCRIPT: Paul Krugman in conversation with Erik Brynjolfsson (3/20/25)
Paul Krugman
Hi everyone. This is my latest video conversation. And now for something, again, quite different. I wanted to steer away mostly from the current political policy environment and towards what is certainly one of the biggest stories, which is AI, but just generally technology. So I'm recording a conversation with Erik Brynjolfsson, who is one of the few economists who has really followed technology as opposed to just sort of plugging it into their models, which is what I do. If you're wondering, I’m actually in a hotel room in Belgium. I'm committing the cardinal sin of a video interview with a bed in the background because it's a pretty small hotel room but here we are. Hi Erik. Erik Brynjolfsson
Hi Paul, good to see you. Paul Krugman
I've been meaning to get you for a conversation. There were some hitches there, but if it weren't for all the other things happening in the world, technology would be one of the biggest stories out there. Certainly very interesting things are happening. As I said, you're an economist who actually knows something about technology, which for lack thereof hasn't stopped some of our colleagues from having strong views. But why don't you tell us a bit about your background and how you came to be that guy? Erik Brynjolfsson
Sure. Well, Paul, you probably don't remember this, but when I was an undergrad, you came and gave a guest lecture at Harvard. That's when I first got to know you. And at the time, I was kind of having one foot in technology and one foot in economics, trying to decide between the two. They asked me to teach a course at Harvard Extension School. So along with my college roommate Tod Loofbourrow, we taught a course on building expert systems and one on applications of artificial intelligence. We started a company called Foundation Technologies in homage to your and my favorite science fiction author, Isaac Asimov. Paul Krugman
Oh my gosh, I didn't know that. Yeah, okay. Erik Brynjolfsson
So we were building these systems back then. And then I decided I really needed a graduate degree to get in a little deeper.","And so I decided to go to MIT where I thought I could maybe do both AI and economics at the same time, but it didn't really work out and I had to choose. And I went more the economics route, but continuing to be really interested in technology and what I was doing. And I was lucky enough to have Bob Solow kind of mentor me. And you may remember back in the eighties, there was this puzzle of, as Bob Solow put it, we see the computer age everywhere except in the productivity statistics and I called that “the productivity paradox.” So we were wondering what all this technology was doing. And so my first real big paper was trying to address that puzzle about technology and productivity. Paul Krugman Okay, great. By the way, not everyone may know, but the foundation novels by Isaac Asimov involve mathematical social scientists who save galactic civilization. And when I was growing up, I wanted to be one of those guys and this is as close as I managed to get. And the productivity paradox is something we all talk about. Let's just talk for a second. Economists generally, starting with the work of Bob Solow—the great Robert Solow, sort of the founder of growth theory in economics—have always given a really crucial role to technological progress. Erik Brynjolfsson Yeah, I think what we all learned in grad school was that Bob Solow back in the 1950s, what he really got his Nobel Prize for was showing that, you know, we're not necessarily working more hours or even having that much more capital. That's not what's driving our higher living standards. It's mainly that we have much better technology than people did in the past. So technology is the main driver of living standards. And he just kind of stuck it in the model as this extra variable and off we went with better and better technology. Since then, a lot of people have tried to flesh that out a little bit in more detail. One of the things that are connected to AI is this class of technologies we call General Purpose Technologies. Economists just used to call them GPTs, but the AI people stole that acronym from us. But General Purpose Technologies are things like the steam engine, electricity, and I think AI. And that's actually what drives most of the progress in our living standards. So that's kind of behind my focus on that set of technologies. Paul Krugman You say, Bob Solow pointed out—I'm not sure when he first made that remark, 1987? Erik Brynjolfsson 1987 in a little article in the New York Review of Books, yeah. Paul Krugman Not many young people realize how revolutionary IT seemed to be. When I was in graduate school, using the computer meant handing a box of punch cards to the high priests behind the glass wall at the mainframe and then waiting an hour for a printout to","I went to Wharton. So I did my Ph.D. there. Then I went to MIT, and I ended up at Stanford, where I'm now. Paul Krugman
That's a very interesting trajectory. So, you went to Wharton, which is a school that's really focused on business, and then you went to MIT, which is more about engineering, and then you ended up at Stanford, which is more of a university. So how did you get from that to economics? Erik Brynjolfsson
Well, I think it's the same as any economist. We start with the question, ""What's going on here?"" So the question was, ""What's going on with information technology?"" And the answer is, ""It's a revolution, but we don't know how to model it."" So that's why I became an economist. I was trying to understand the economics of information technology. Paul Krugman
Right. So that's the story. And I think that's a good story. I was going to ask you, as an economist, what do you think is the role of technology in the economy? But before that, I want to ask you about the current AI revolution. I know that the field has been evolving for a while, but we're seeing a lot of talk about AI, and I think that's more of a recent phenomenon. So, what's the difference between the current AI revolution and the previous ones? Erik Brynjolfsson
That's a great question. So the first AI revolution was in the 1950s, with the first attempts to create a machine that could think. The second was in the 1980s, when people started to realize that machines could learn from data. The third was in the 2000s, with the rise of big data and the Internet. The fourth is now, with the rise of large language models and the explosion of",491,500,303,0.2975,0.2195,0.9883,0.9554,0.9035,0.7161,1.8296,-4.8641,0.4142,0.409,0.0575,0.0547,0.0057,0.0041,0.6431,0.6762,0.9753,0.9751,0.4239864864864865,0.4472271914132379,0.5,7,7,0.9805,0.9559,0.1690427698574338,0.116,0.22772277227722773,0.9476,0.6904,29-05-2025
Paul Krugman,How Worried Should We Be About the Economy_.txt,"Suddenly, everyone is pessimistic. The “Trump bump” in stocks seems like a distant memory; consumer confidence has plunged; there’s recession talk everywhere. But is the pessimism overdone? Honestly, I don’t fully trust my own judgment here. They actually don’t teach macroeconomic forecasting in graduate school; also, partisanship is a hell of a drug, and I don’t trust myself to be immune. So I wanted to talk to someone who assesses macroeconomic risks for a living and has a track record of not getting carried away. I’ve followed Neil Dutta of Renaissance Macro for a while, and was struck by a recent article in which he talked calmly about the reasons he sees bigger downside risks. So here’s a conversation in which we talk all about that, including some interesting arguments to the effect that we’d be facing significant headwinds even without Trump-generated uncertainty. Transcript follows. TRANSCRIPT: Paul Krugman with Neil Dutta, recorded 3/12/25
Paul Krugman
So hi, Paul Krugman here again. For this week's video discussion, I contacted Neil Dutta from Renaissance Macro who does macro forecasting, which is forecasting the economy, which is not something I ever studied, not something I'm actually any good at. It's kind of a black art, but I've been reading his stuff over the years and it's been interesting and he had a piece that I read a couple of weeks ago about why he's starting to actually get worried about at least the possibility of a recession after having been pretty bullish on at least short-term growth all through the storm und drang of recent years. And I thought it'd be interesting to talk to him and get a professional's take. So, hi Neil. Welcome to my virtual space here. Neil Dutta
Thank you. It's an honor to meet you and talk to you. Paul Krugman
Yeah, so here's the thing. If you're an academic economist, you don't hardly ever worry about what the growth is going to be in the next quarter. That's not your business, even the next year. I even once long ago made fun of it as “up and down economics,” except, as it turns out, it matters a lot when it interacts with politics. And before we get into where we are now, talk to me a little bit about how you go about doing this. I mean, some people have actual models and we want to talk about that a bit, but what do you look at when you're trying to figure out what's going to happen in the near term? Neil Dutta
Sure, so I mean, just to give you a little bit about my background, I work at Renaissance Macro Research. We're basically a macro research provider and we cover market strategy, we cover DC policy, like what pieces of legislation are moving up and down the halls of Congress, and we cover economics. So we tend to think of those sort of as like the three pillars of macro investing.","And I cover the economics piece of it. So our clients range from pension funds to hedge funds, people that are doing long and short equity strategies, people that do multi-asset strategy. And what they're looking for from us isn't so much a GDP point forecast. I think that's when we talk about macro forecasting. I mean, a lot of people get tied up on, what's your GDP forecast? I can do that, but that's not really why people come and talk to me. Why people come and talk to me, I think, is because they're trying to understand what the risks are to the consensus. So you have lots of people that kind of input their forecasts into the blue chip for a survey of consensus forecasters. Bloomberg News does want that. But what my clients are looking for isn't so much, you know, “where do you think GDP growth is going to be,” but “where are the risks to where the consensus is, and where should I invest my money given that forecast?” And so, you know, believe it or not, a lot of people live in the short run with their investments, particularly, some of our clients. I mean, there are people that live in the long run, but a lot of people don't. And that's why they're looking for some insight as to where the risks are. And so that's kind of what I do. You know, if people ask me for a GDP call, I'll give it to them. And we have simple spreadsheets that kind of tell us about where we think the economy is going. Nothing too fancy. I mean, I've been doing this now for almost 20 years. Most of the math that's used on Wall Street or business economics is sort of back of the envelope type stuff. You're not going into MATLAB and doing, like, a huge statistical analysis to get these estimates. But I think highlighting risk to consensus is basically why people talk to us. Paul Krugman Unfortunately, it turns out Keynes probably never actually said the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. But something like that. I mean, he kind of implied that. And it is actually true that when he said “in the long run we're all dead,” he didn't mean it actually for this situation. But nonetheless, it's true. People need to at least know what can go wrong or also what can go right, what can be different. So what are you looking at? There's official statistics, we all know, although the numbers get revised, but there's a number that comes out on the first Friday of each month, which is job growth in the previous month, and all of that. But all of that stuff tends to be, well, first of all, it's retrospective. It's more retrospective than most people realize, and it's also not telling you what comes next. So what do you look at to try and","So for me, I work with a team of analysts who look at these three pillars. So, first, we look at the economics. So we look at data, we look at the numbers, and we look at the trends. We look at the labor market, the business cycle, the inflation, the consumer confidence, the GDP, the unemployment rate, the trade deficit, the balance of payments, all those kinds of numbers. Then, we look at the politics, which is like what's going on in Congress, what's going on with the administration, what are the key policy levers that are available to the government, and what are the risks to that. And then, third, we look at the markets, which is the financial markets, the stock market, the bond market, the currency, the commodities, the interest rates, the volatility, and the sentiment of the market. So we look at all of that. And the idea is that we're trying to build a picture of what's going on in the macroeconomic environment. So when we think about the future, we're trying to figure out what's going on with the macroeconomic environment, what's the trajectory of the economy, and then how that's going to play out in the financial markets. So that's how we approach it. So, for example, if we see a lot of economic data that's not showing the kind of growth that we expected, that could be a sign of a slowdown, or maybe even a recession. Or if we see a lot of political uncertainty, that could be a sign of a lot of volatility in the financial markets. So, in that sense, we look at all three pillars, and then we try to build a picture of what the future might look like. Paul Krugman
Okay, so that's your approach. So you have a team of analysts that look at these three pillars. Now, in the recent article that I read, you were talking about",496,500,326,0.2038,0.1294,0.9408,0.8953,0.8141,0.955,-3.7404,0.9471,0.427,0.3686,0.0608,0.0574,0.0127,0.0085,0.6259,0.5733,0.979,0.9422,0.44991511035653653,0.4807370184254606,0.49238578680203043,7,5,0.9941,0.9343,0.15524193548387097,0.184,0.2085889570552147,0.857,0.6272,29-05-2025
Paul Krugman,Worthwhile Canadian Observations.txt,"For those puzzled by my headline: Back in 1986 The New Republic challenged its readers to come up with a headline more boring than “Worthwhile Canadian Initiative,” the title of a New York Times op-ed by Flora Lewis. They couldn’t. Canada, you see, was considered inherently boring. As I wrote a couple of months ago, economists have never considered Canada boring: It has often been a laboratory for distinctive policies. But now it’s definitely not boring: Canada, which will hold a snap election next month, seems poised to deliver a huge setback to Donald Trump’s foreign ambitions, one that may inspire much of the world — including many people in the United States — to stand up to the MAGA power grab. So this seems like a good time to look north and see what we can learn. Here are three observations inspired by Canada that seem highly relevant to the United States. Other countries are real
I don’t know what set Trump off on Canada, what made him think that it would be a good idea to start talking about annexation. Presumably, though, he expected Canadians to act like, say, university presidents, and immediately submit to his threats. What he actually did was to rally Canadians against MAGA. Just two months ago Canada’s governing Liberals seemed set for a historic collapse, with Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre the all-but-inevitable next prime minister. Now, if the polls are to be believed, Poilievre — who has been trying to escape his image as a Canadian Trump, but apparently not successfully — is effectively out of the running:
Source: Data Shows
I won’t count my poutine until it’s served, but it does seem as if Trump’s bullying has not only failed but backfired spectacularly. (And, arguably, saved Canada; all indications are that Poilievre is a real piece of work.) But why? Much of this is on Trump, who always expects others to grovel on command. But it also reflects a general limitation of the American imagination: we tend to have a hard time accepting that other countries are real, that they have their own histories and feel strong national pride. Canada, in particular, arguably defined itself as a nation in the 19th century by its determination not to be absorbed by the United States. In fact, there are almost eerie parallels between some of those old confrontations and current events. The 1890 McKinley tariff, of which Trump speaks with such admiration, was in part intended to pressure Canada into joining the U.S.. Instead, it inspired a backlash: Canada imposed high reciprocal tariffs, sought to strengthen economic linkages between its own provinces, and built a closer economic relationship with Britain. Sure enough, Mark Carney, the current and probably continuing Canadian prime minister, has emphasized removing remaining obstacles to interprovincial trade and seems to be seeking closer ties to Europe.","Trump may expect submission; he’s actually getting “elbows up.” Time and chance happeneth to us all Why, but for the grace of Donald Trump, was the Liberal Party headed for electoral catastrophe? There were specific policy issues like the nation’s carbon tax and Justin Trudeau’s personal unpopularity, but surely the main reason was a continuation of the factors that made 2024 a graveyard for incumbents everywhere, especially continuing voter anger about the inflation surge of 2021-22. Some of us tried to point out that the very universality of the inflation surge meant that it couldn’t be attributed to the policies of any one country’s government. If Bidenomics was responsible for U.S. inflation, why did Europe experience almost the same cumulative rise in prices that we did? But there was never much chance of that argument getting traction in the United States, where we have a hard time realizing that other countries exist. The Canadians, however, definitely know that we exist, and you might think that public anger over inflation would have been assuaged by the recognition that Canada’s inflation very closely tracked inflation south of the border: But no, Canadian voters were prepared to punish the incumbent party anyway for just happening to hold power in a difficult time. The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet electoral victory to parties with good policies; but time and chance happeneth to them all. Life is about more than GDP Canada’s inflation experience looks a lot like ours, but in other ways Canada has clearly underperformed. In particular, it has had weak productivity growth, which has left it substantially poorer than the U.S.. Canada, The Economist declared in a much-quoted article, is now poorer than Alabama, as measured by GDP per capita. That’s not quite what my numbers say, but close. Yet Canada doesn’t look like Alabama; it doesn’t feel like Alabama; and by any measure other than GDP it isn’t anything like Alabama. Here’s GDP per capita along with a widely used measure of life satisfaction, the same one often cited when pointing out how happy the Nordic countries seem to be, and life expectancy at birth: Sources: IMF, Bureau of Economic Analysis, Gallup, World Bank So yes, Canada’s GDP per capita is comparable to that of very poor U.S. states. So is per capita GDP in Finland, generally considered the world’s happiest nation. But Canadians appear, on average, to be more satisfied with their lives than we are, although not at Nordic levels. We don’t have a comparable number for Alabama, but surveys consistently show it as one of our least happy states. Part of the explanation for this discrepancy, no doubt, is that so much of U.S. national income accrues to a small number of wealthy people; inequality in Canada is much lower. And I don’t know about you, but I believe that one important contributor to the quality of life is not being dead, something Canadians are pretty good at; on","So, in that sense, Canada is not just a country that is different from the United States; it is a country that has a different relationship with the United States.
The second lesson is that the U.S. should not take its economic policies as given. It’s not that the U.S. is necessarily bad at economics, but it’s not always the case that the American way is the best way. As we’ve seen in the U.S., the Trump administration has been quite successful at imposing tariffs, but also at creating economic chaos. The U.S. has been in a trade war with China for years, and while the U.S. has been able to get a lot of tariff relief from China, it has also created a lot of economic problems for itself. The U.S. has also been in a trade war with Mexico, and this has been bad for the U.S. as well. So, while the U.S. has had some success in trade wars, it has also created a lot of problems for itself. This is a lesson that Canada has learned, and it has been more successful in managing the trade wars it has had with the U.S. In particular, Canada has a much more stable economic policy, and it has been able to navigate the trade wars with the U.S. without creating the kind of economic chaos that has been the case in the U.S. The U.S. is also not as strong in the global economy as it once was. It is now more dependent on the global economy, and it is not as strong as it used to be. So, while the U.S. is still a major economic power, it is not as strong as it was in the 1980s or 1990s. Canada has been able to take advantage of this by maintaining a more stable economic policy, and by being more flexible in its economic approach. So, the lesson from Canada is that the U.S. should not take",475,500,330,0.2205,0.1841,0.9657,0.9155,0.9145,0.3951,-1.8776,-13.2795,0.3573,0.3125,0.04,0.034,0.0055,0.0046,0.5045,0.562,0.9736,0.9491,0.39138240574506283,0.4148397976391231,0.5491803278688525,8,5,0.9871,0.8454,0.14526315789473684,0.142,0.17575757575757575,0.8357,0.5049,29-05-2025
Paul Krugman,"Oppose, Oppose, Oppose — and Do It Loudly.txt","My political views aren’t a secret, and there’s obviously a political aspect to much of what I write. In general, however, I avoid offering political advice. After all, I’m neither a strategist nor a political scientist (although I read political scientists — unlike the people running things now, I respect expertise.)
Today, however, I’m going to make an exception, and offer three words of advice to Democratic politicians and MAGA opponents in general: oppose, oppose, oppose. And make noise. A lot of noise. Don’t make conciliatory gestures in the belief that Trump has a mandate to do what he’s doing; don’t stay quiet on the outrages being committed every day while waiting for grocery prices to rise. I can’t promise that taking a tough line will succeed, but going easy on Trump is guaranteed to fail. It's true that many MAGA opponents were demoralized by Trump’s victory, and initially withdrew emotionally from politics. Hey, I’m human too; for a while I watched a lot of musical performances and reread beloved novels. But it’s time to move on and not be intimidated. Let me start with the notion that Trump has a popular mandate that Democrats oppose at their peril. As I said, I am not a political scientist. But I do know that political scientists consider the whole notion of presidential mandates more or less a myth. Also, I haven’t slept through the past 20 years. I know that in 2008 Barack Obama won the popular vote by 7.2 percentage points, yet Republicans opposed his agenda every step of the way. In January 2009, when the economy was losing 800,000 jobs a month, not a single House Republican voted for Obama’s rescue plan. I also know that Joe Biden won by 4.5 percent in 2020, yet received no Republican support for anything he did. Did Republicans pay a price for opposing and obstructing Obama and Biden? Hardly. They won big in the 2010 midterms and, of course, took Congress and the White House last November. So Democrats are supposed to show deference to Donald Trump, who won by 1.5 percent — and didn’t even win a majority of the overall vote? Now, I have a hypothesis about the belief that Democrats should defer to Trump in a way that Republicans never have to Democratic presidents. It is, I suspect, in part a perverse response to Trump’s utter lack of the moral and intellectual qualities we used to expect in a president. I’ve never seen anyone say this explicitly, but as I read it the implicit reasoning goes like this: the fact that Trump won despite his obvious awfulness means that his issues must have resonated powerfully with voters. But was Trump’s awfulness actually obvious to voters? Not to the low-information voters who provided his margin of victory. And was it even that obvious to voters who followed the news, but only somewhat superficially? The mainstream media heavily sanewashed Trump throughout the campaign. So why did Trump win?","I’ve seen many analyses, some quite elaborate, but to some extent you need to bear in mind that at least some of the people pushing these analyses are in effect talking their own book — making the case that Democrats would have won, or will win in the future, if only they were taking the analyst’s advice. I still haven’t seen anything convincing me that the basic story wasn’t simple, and the same as the story that explains incumbent party defeats around the world. It's a well-established result that when prices and wages both rise — as they did almost everywhere as economies recovered from Covid, stressing supply chains — workers tend to attribute higher wages to their own efforts, while blaming higher prices on external forces, especially politicians: Source: BLS This logic is what made 2024, as John Burn-Murdoch put it, a “graveyard of incumbents.” But it didn’t give Trump a mandate to rename the Gulf of Mexico, invade Greenland, shut down the National Institutes of Health, fire DEI administrators or really to do anything besides reduce prices and control illegal immigration (which was already way down.) Many voters believed that he could do just that; the most recent surveys show Republican voters on average believing that Trump can magically reduce inflation to zero over the next year — and since that’s an average, many of them apparently think he can actually reduce prices, which he indeed promised to do during the campaign: Source: Briefing Book He can’t, of course, and has no plan to fight inflation, let alone reduce prices. His most recent blast on the subject is almost pathetic in its lack of ideas, other than the proposition that DEI is somehow responsible for everything bad: But Democrats can’t just sit around waiting for Trump’s promises to fail. They need to constantly challenge him on the issue, keep reminding voters that he lied about it all through the campaign, and hang rising prices around his neck every step of the way. Nor, as I see it, should they narrowly focus on kitchen-table issues. One reason low-information voters may have believed Trump’s nonsense claims about being able to reduce prices is that some of them really thought he was the brilliant manager he played on TV. The reality, however, is that the Trump administration has made a complete shambles of its first 10 days, especially with their it’s on, no it isn’t, yes it is spending freeze that is both destructive and clearly illegal, and has itself been frozen by the courts. It would be political malpractice for Democrats not to make an issue of Trump’s raging incompetence. I also think and certainly hope that the ugliness of Trump’s character will quickly become a political liability. We all know and dislike people who are always looking for someone else to blame when bad things happen. I can’t imagine that Trump’s reaction to the DC plane crash — blaming it on DEI, that is, asserting without evidence that someone","Because he was so effective at marketing himself, and so effective at organizing his supporters, that even the people who didn’t believe in his policies were convinced that he was a good leader. The people who supported him were convinced that he was a good leader. The people who didn’t support him were convinced that he was a good leader. That’s a very strange thing. But that’s what happened. The problem with this reasoning is that it assumes that if you are a leader and you are effective at marketing and organizing, you can win despite your lack of actual qualities. But that is not how politics works. In fact, that’s the opposite of how politics works. The real reason people support a leader is because they believe in the leader’s qualities, not because they believe the leader is effective at marketing and organizing. That’s the key point. So if you are a leader who is not qualified, and you are effective at marketing and organizing, you can win — but only by convincing people that you are qualified. And that is exactly what Trump did. He convinced people that he was qualified, and he convinced them that he was the right person for the job. So if you are going to oppose Trump, you need to be consistent and not just oppose him on some of his policies. If you just oppose him on some policies, you are not going to be effective. You have to oppose him on all of them. But that is a very hard task. If you are a Democrat, you are going to be accused of being a traitor to your party, or at least to your party’s values. But if you don’t oppose him, you are a traitor to your country. The only way to be a traitor to your country is to be a traitor to your party. So, as a Democrat, you have to be a traitor to your party in order to be a loyal citizen. Which is a bit of a paradox, but it’s a paradox we",497,500,348,0.2392,0.0944,0.9683,0.9089,0.4259,0.9673,21.1602,0.5303,0.3325,0.2949,0.0369,0.015,0.0054,0.0,0.3953,0.4149,0.9668,0.9506,0.41008403361344536,0.4249146757679181,0.5975308641975309,7,6,0.9138,0.9765,0.13883299798792756,0.114,0.10632183908045977,0.8571,0.5668,29-05-2025
Paul Krugman,Attack of the Sadistic Zombies.txt,"Republicans in Congress, taking their marching orders from Donald Trump, are on track to enact a hugely regressive budget — big tax giveaways to the wealthy combined with cruel cuts in programs that serve lower-income Americans. True, the legislation suffered a setback last week, initially failing to make it out of committee. But that was largely because some right-wing Republicans didn’t think the benefit cuts were vicious enough. OK, news at 11. Isn’t this what Republicans always do? But this reconciliation bill — that is, legislation structured in such a way that it can’t be filibustered and may well pass with no Democratic votes — is different in both degree and kind from what we’ve seen before: Its cruelty is exceptional even by recent right-wing standards. Furthermore, the way that cruelty will be implemented is notable for its reliance on claims we know aren’t true and policies we know won’t work — what some of us call zombie ideas. And it’s hard to avoid the sense that the counterproductive viciousness is actually the point. Think of what we’re seeing as the attack of the sadistic zombies. To get a sense of how extreme this legislation is, do a side-by-side comparison of the impact on different groups of Americans between this bill and Trump’s one major legislative achievement during his first term, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. It looks like this:
Source: Tax Policy Center and Penn-Wharton Budget Model
The TCJA, like the current legislation, gave big tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans. But it also threw a few crumbs to people further down the scale. By contrast, the House Reconciliation Bill, by slashing benefits — especially Medicaid — will cause immense, almost inconceivable hardship to the bottom 40 percent of Americans, especially the poorest fifth. Medicaid, in case anyone needs reminding, is the national health insurance program for low-income Americans who probably don’t have any other way to pay for medical care. In 2023 Medicaid covered 69 million Americans, far more than Medicare (which covers seniors), including 39 percent of children. Providing health care to children, by the way, isn’t just about social justice and basic decency. It’s also good economics: Children who receive adequate care grow up to be more productive adults. Among other things they end up paying more taxes, so Medicaid for children almost surely pays for itself. And although Republican legislation apparently won’t explicitly target childrens’ care, it will impose paperwork requirements that will cause both children and their parents to lose coverage. Back to the comparison with the TCJA. It's true that 2017 would have looked considerably worse in this comparison if Trump had also succeeded in his attempt to destroy the Affordable Care Act, depriving millions of Americans of health insurance coverage. But he didn’t. This time the assault on health care and the tax cuts for the 0.1 percent are part of the same legislation — a “big, beautiful bill,” as Trump calls it.","And after some adjustments to make the bill even nastier, it’s likely to pass. Wait, it gets worse. One of the ways Republicans will try to slash Medicaid is by requiring that adult Medicaid recipients be gainfully employed — or, more accurately, that they demonstrate to the satisfaction of government bureaucrats that they are gainfully employed, which is not at all the same thing. The belief that many Americans receiving government support are malingering, that they could and should be working but are choosing to be lazy, is a classic zombie idea. That is, like the claim that cutting taxes on the rich will unleash an economic miracle, it’s a doctrine that should be long dead. It has, after all, been proved wrong by experience again and again. But right-wingers simply refuse to accept the reality that almost everyone on Medicaid is either a child, a senior, disabled or between jobs. A recent article in the Times by Matt Bruenig had a very illuminating chart: Only 3 percent of Medicaid recipients were non-disabled working-age adults persistently not working — the kind of people right-wingers imagine infest the program. And it’s a good bet that a fair number of these people had extenuating circumstances of some kind. So what do work requirements actually accomplish? They don’t get lazy people to work. What they do, instead, is take away benefits from people who are legally entitled to aid, because they can’t overcome the paperwork and administrative barriers. Think about it: Low-income adults, even when working, are often employed as day laborers or in other informal ways that don’t generate the right forms. They may lack the formal education to deal with complex reporting requirements. So the people who need help most are unjustly cut off. Why, then, are Republicans doing this? Part of the answer is to save money: By making the poor even poorer they reduce the extent to which tax cuts for the rich explode the budget deficit. But I’m actually skeptical that this is the whole story, or even most of it. If you pay attention to what right-wing Republicans do, as opposed to what they say, it becomes obvious that they don’t really care about budget deficits. Oh, they do a lot of posturing, issuing dire warnings about debt and pretending to be deficit hawks. But can you think of a single example in which the U.S. right has been willing to give up something it wants, such as tax cuts for the rich, in order to reduce the deficit? As I see it, right-wingers’ rhetoric about the budget deficit is a lot like their rhetoric about antisemitism. It’s not something they actually care about. It’s just a club they can use to bash their opponents. But in that case, why the cruelty toward less-fortunate Americans? Well, as I see it the cruelty, as opposed to the dollars saved, is actually the point. Inflicting harm on the vulnerable isn’t something they do with regret, it’s something they do","The bill is so regressive that even the Tax Policy Center says it would raise the share of income that the bottom 40 percent of Americans pay in taxes. The Tax Policy Center is a nonpartisan, respected institution. In fact, the Tax Policy Center says that even if the bill is passed, it will reduce the tax burden on the bottom 40 percent of Americans. Wait, that doesn’t make sense. Let me double-check. Yes, the Tax Policy Center says that the bill would increase the share of income that the bottom 40 percent of Americans pay in taxes. So the tax burden is higher, but the absolute amount is lower. But the bill would still have a very large negative impact on the bottom 40 percent. So even if the bottom 40 percent pay a higher share of their income in taxes, the amount they pay is still lower than it was before. So the bill is a very bad deal for the bottom 40 percent. That’s not the only way that the bill is bad. The bill also includes a tax cut for the top 1 percent that would be even bigger than the TCJA. The bill also includes a cut to the child tax credit, which was a major program that helped millions of working families afford to feed their kids. The child tax credit is a huge, important program — it’s the largest single source of federal aid to working families. And the bill also includes a cut to the child nutrition program. That’s the program that provides free or reduced-price school lunches to millions of children, especially low-income children. The bill also includes a cut to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the food stamp program. The bill is so bad that even the Tax Policy Center says it’s the most regressive tax bill in U.S. history. Wait, no. The Tax Policy Center says it's the most regressive tax bill in U to date. But then it says that the bill",493,500,335,0.1868,0.253,0.9683,0.9601,0.8438,0.7052,-3.3118,-6.2518,0.3559,0.3126,0.0337,0.0565,0.0077,0.0154,0.4713,0.4414,0.9749,0.9201,0.38687392055267705,0.4565587734241908,0.3894736842105263,7,7,0.9918,0.9345,0.12981744421906694,0.144,0.11940298507462686,0.8698,0.5597,29-05-2025
Paul Krugman,Why Trump Will Lose His Trade War.txt,"Scenes from the trade war:
In response to Donald Trump’s huge tariffs on Chinese exports, China’s government has suspended exports of rare earth minerals and magnets, both critical to many modern industries and the military
Trade talks between the United States and the European Union appear to have gone nowhere, with Maros Sefcovic, the EU’s top trade official, reportedly having “struggled to determine America’s aims.”
In other words, the Chinese, unlike the Trump administration, understand what trade and trade wars are about. And the Trumpers, in addition to not knowing what they’re doing, don’t even know what they want. Here’s what Trump and his sycophants don’t understand about international trade: It’s not about what you can sell, it’s about what you can buy. Think for a minute about the finances of individuals. Why do people work? Not to be able to boast that they ran trade surpluses with their employers — “Hey, they paid me a lot, and I hardly bought anything from them.” No, people sell their labor so that they can afford to buy stuff. The same is true for countries. Importing what you want — being able to get stuff from other countries — is the purpose of international trade. Exporting — sending stuff to other countries — is something we do so we can pay for imports. OK, in practice there’s a bit more to the story, as I’ll explain below, but the complications don’t change the fundamental proposition that the benefits from international trade basically come from being able to import goods that would be expensive or impossible to produce at home. Think hydroelectric power from Canada. This fundamental reality explains why serious analyses of Trump’s trade war with China often conclude that China, not America, has the upper hand. Yesterday the Financial Times had a mostly good writeup of the stakes, which pointed out that US exports to China are “heavily focused on agriculture.” The FT said that these goods are “low value-added,” which I’m not sure is true — U.S. farming is highly productive and highly capital-intensive. But what matters in a trade war is the fact that China can fairly easily find other agricultural suppliers, buying soybeans from Brazil instead of Iowa. By contrast, the United States will have a hard time replacing many of the goods it imports from China. Furthermore, many of the goods we buy from China are industrial inputs rather than consumer goods. So Trump has started a trade war that will disrupt our own supply chains. Remember Covid and its immediate aftermath? Remember how shortages spread through the economy and fueled inflation? Those days are about to come back, inflicting especially large damage on the manufacturing sector Trump claims he will revive. Is the U.S. economy at China’s mercy? No. America remains a highly productive nation that could cope with even severe economic shocks if it had smart, clear-headed leadership. But we don’t. True, today’s Wall Street Journal has an article with the headline “U.S.","Plans to Use Trade Negotiations to Isolate China.” So you might think that there’s an actual strategy out there. But I don’t believe it, for four reasons. First, this story was clearly leaked by Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, or people close to him. In a normal administration this kind of supposedly inside scoop would offer valuable insights into the policy process. But one thing that’s clear about Trump tariffs is that there is no policy process. Individual officials — Bessent, Peter Navarro, Howard Lutnick — keep floating policy ideas in public, hoping that putting them out there will somehow create facts. But a day or two later another official will go on TV, or Trump will post something on Truth Social, completely contradicting what the last official said. So what we’re hearing about Bessent isn’t really a scoop about Trump policy, it’s almost surely an attempt by Bessent to influence policy. And there’s no reason to believe that he’s actually in charge. Second, even if U.S. negotiators are trying to cut deals with other countries that would isolate China, they will be unlikely to succeed because Trump has lost all credibility. After all, you can’t make deals with other countries unless foreign governments believe that you will honor the agreements you make. Trump has already destroyed U.S. credibility on that front, ripping up all our existing trade agreements, then making wild changes in his own tariffs every few days. Third, even if Trump’s promises were credible, why would a European government want to join America’s trade war with China, destroying its own supply chains? If the argument is that it’s worth paying the cost of ruined supply chains because that will protect you from Trump’s tariffs, who trusts Trump not to reimpose punitive tariffs on our supposed allies the next time he thinks they’re looking at him funny? Fourth, the Trump administration is bringing a knife to a gun fight. To the extent that there’s a real plan to confront China, it appears to center on reducing China’s ability to sell abroad. It’s true that this will be painful for China’s export sector. As I said, my flat statement that trade is about imports, not exports, needs some qualification because the short-term interests of exporters can’t be ignored. But China can cope with lost exports by aiding affected industries, the same way Trump funneled money to farmers hurt by his first trade war. It can also offset any loss of export jobs by stimulating domestic demand. Moreover, Xi and the Chinese Communist Party don’t face elections. So while China can manage the loss of exports in various ways, it will be much harder for America to cope with the loss of crucial inputs produced in China. The overall point is that even relatively sophisticated Trumpers like Bessent are still thinking in terms of Chinese access to the markets of the United States and our imagined trade war allies, when the real issue now is whether China can strangle the","Trade Deficit Falls to 2.6% of GDP, a 10-Year Low,” but that’s not relevant. The deficit is a result of the U.S. economy being large and productive — not of any trade policy. The United States can and will reduce its trade deficit by growing its economy, or by cutting its consumption. The U to China trade war is not about reducing the deficit. It’s about something else. The author is arguing that the U.S. is in a trade war with China, and that the U.S. is losing. But he's not arguing that the U.S. is losing because of its trade deficit. He's arguing that the U.S. is losing because of its trade policies. The author says that the U.S. is in a trade war with China, and that the U.S. is losing, but that the U.S. is not losing because of its trade deficit. He is arguing that the U.S. is losing because of the trade policies that it is pursuing. The author is saying that the U.S. is not losing because of the trade deficit but because of trade policies.

The author is saying that the U.S. is losing because of its trade policies, not because of the trade deficit. Therefore, the author is saying that the U.S. is not losing because of the trade deficit, but because of the trade policies.

Paul Krugman,What the Musk is Happening_.txt,"When writing posts for this newsletter, I like to have a clear focus and offer a tightly argued thesis, backed by data. This, however, won’t be that kind of post. If I had to summarize the state of affairs right now, I would quote Charlie Brown: “Aaugh!”
Here’s where we are as a nation right now:
1. We may be in the middle of a trade war. Or maybe not
2. We’re in the middle of a constitutional crisis. No maybe. 3. We may be in the midst of a sort of digital coup, which might as a side consequence cause large parts of the federal government to cease functioning at all. The unifying theme here, I guess, is that the federal government has been taken over by bad people who also are also stunningly ignorant. Start with the maybe/maybe not trade war. The Trump administration was, to all appearances, ready to impose 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico last night. This would have been self-destructive (and also a violation of past agreements) even if our neighbors didn’t retaliate. And both made it clear that they would retaliate. These are real countries, with real patriotism and pride, and they weren’t ready to be bullied. And Trump folded. OK, supposedly the tariffs are only on hold for a month, but some wags are already joking that “tariff month” will become the new “infrastructure week.”
And supposedly both Mexico and Canada made some concessions in return for the tariff hold. But there’s really nothing there; neither country is doing anything it wouldn’t have done without the tariff threat. The U.S., on the other hand, agreed to crack down on weapons shipments to Mexico. Trump will spin this as a victory; low-information voters and some intimidated media outlets may go along with the lie. But basically America backed down. So is Trump the classic bully who runs away when someone stands up to him? It definitely looks that way. Let’s be clear, however: this isn’t a case of no harm, no foul. By making the tariff threat in the first place, Trump made it clear that America is no longer a nation that honors its agreements. By caving at the first sign of opposition, he also made himself look weak. China must be very pleased at how all this has played out. And as I argued the other day, the now ever-present threat of tariffs will have a chilling effect on business planning, inhibiting economic integration and damaging manufacturing. Still, the trade war didn’t happen, at least so far. But the constitutional crisis is in full swing. Yesterday Elon Musk, after spending the weekend denouncing the U.S. Agency for International Development as “evil,” a “viper’s nest of radical-left marxists who hate America,” and a “criminal organization,” announced that the agency was being shut down. Now, Musk isn’t the president — at least I don’t think he is; he isn’t even a government official.","But Donald Trump has confirmed the move, which is illegal and unconstitutional. No qualifying language, no “might be” or “some say” evasions, please. Congress passed a law establishing USAID as an independent agency, and the president can’t abolish it unless Congress passes new legislation to that effect. It seems almost beside the point to ask what this is about, but still: What’s this about? If this is supposed to be about saving money, here’s the role of USAID in the federal budget: Source: Congressional Budget Office, Congressional Research Service So why is Musk such a hysterical enemy of the agency, whose main purpose is providing humanitarian aid? There may be some backstory here, in which USAID somehow once interfered with a Musk project. And Musk is surely banking on public innumeracy: abolishing an agency sounds as if it will save a lot of money, and few voters understand how small $40 billion is in the federal context. But my guess is that in Musk’s worldview the mere fact of trying to help people in need makes you a radical-left Marxist who hates America. My final point is a bit trickier, because we don’t yet know how it will turn out. Musk associates have been given access to the U.S. Treasury’s systems that control all federal payments, from grants to nonprofits to Social Security checks to salaries of federal workers. The potential for mischief here is immense. The courts may have told the Trump administration that it can’t freeze spending mandated by Congress, but Musk’s people, who haven’t shown much reverence for the law, might well just ignore the courts and not cut the checks. And they could go beyond cutting off programs the Musk/Trump administration doesn’t like. Imagine that you’re a federal contractor who has made campaign donations to Democrats; suddenly the government stops paying what it owes you and brushes off inquiries by saying that they’re working on the problem. Or you’re a federal employee who, according to somebody in your office who has a personal grievance, has expressed sympathy for DEI; somehow your regularly scheduled salary payments stop being deposited into your bank account. Or even imagine that you’re a retiree who canvassed for Kamala Harris, and for some reason your checks from Social Security stop coming. Don’t say they wouldn’t do such things. We’ve seen these people in action, and of course they would if they could. For the moment they probably can’t. The federal payments system is immensely complex, and like most government infrastructure has been financially squeezed for decades. So it’s cobbled together, much of it running on old hardware and even older software, kept functioning thanks to old hands and institutional memory. The 20-somethings Musk is deploying to take over, locking out those old hands and pushing aside the people who know how the system works, almost surely don’t understand enough to politicize payments right away. As Nathan Tankus, the go-to expert on these matters, says, I 100% believe that the primary barrier to","He is a private citizen, a billionaire, a self-made man, and an engineer. But he was allowed to say that. And then he was allowed to take action. That’s the problem with the current administration. It has given a lot of power to private citizens and private companies, in the name of “free markets.” But the problem is, when you give too much power to private citizens, you end up with a very dangerous situation. For instance, if you have a billionaire who is a self-made man, and he’s got a lot of money, he can take it upon himself to say that a government agency is evil. He can then take it upon himself to shut it down. If the government is not in a position to stop him, then it’s a crisis. But it’s not just the Agency for International Development. It’s the entire system. The government is not in control. The federal government is not in control. The federal government is in a state of crisis. Because the government is not in control. The people who are in control are not the ones who are supposed to be in control. That is the crux of the problem. The government is being taken over by people who are not the right people. And the people who are in control are not the ones who are supposed to be in control. So what’s the solution? I don’t know. But I do know that this is not the way to run a country. This is not the way to govern. So now the third problem, the digital coup. We have a government that is being taken over by people who are not the right people, and now that government is being taken over by people who are not the right people in the digital world. The digital world is not a government. The digital world is not a country. But the people in charge of the digital world are now taking over the government. This is a digital coup.

Robin Hanson,Elite-Only Financial Markets.txt,"Prediction markets are financial markets, but compared to typical financial markets they are intended more to aggregate info than to hedge risks. Thus we can use our general understanding of financial markets to understand prediction markets, and can also try to apply whatever we learn about prediction markets to financial markets more generally. With this in mind, consider the newly published paper Crowd prediction systems: Markets, polls, and elite forecasters, by Atanasov, Witkowski, Mellers, and Tetlock. They use data from 1300 forecasters on 147 questions over four years from the Good Judgement Project’s entry in the IARPA ACE tournament, 2011-2015. (I was part of another team in that tournament.) They judge outcomes by averaging quadratic Brier-score accuracy over questions and time. They find that:
Participants who used my logarithmic market scoring rule (LMSR) mechanism did better than those using a continuous double auction market (mainly better when few traders), and did about as well as those using a complex poll aggregation mechanism, which did better than simpler polling aggregation methods. One element of the complex polling mechanism, an “extremization” power-law transformation of probabilities, also makes market prices more accurate. Participants who were put together into teams did better than those who were not. Accuracy is much (~14-18%) better if you take the 2% of participants most accurate in a year, and then using only these “elites” in future years. It didn’t matter which mechanism was used when selecting that 2% elite. The authors see this last result as their most important:
The practical question we set to address focused on a manager who seeks to maximize forecasting performance in a crowdsourcing environment through her choices about forecasting systems and crowds. Our investigation points to specific recommendations. …Our results offer a clear recommendation for improving accuracy: employ smaller, elite crowds. These findings are relevant to corporate forecasting tournaments as well as to the growing research literature on public forecasting tournaments. Whether the prediction system is an LMSR market or prediction polls, managers could improve performance by selecting a smaller, elite crowd based on prior performance in the competition. Small, elite forecaster crowds may yield benefits beyond accuracy. For example, when forecasts use proprietary data or relate to confidential outcomes, employing a smaller group of forecasters may help minimize information leakage. This makes sense for a manager who plans to ask ~>1300 participants ~>150 questions over ~>4 years, and who trusts some subordinate to judge how exactly to select this elite, and how to set the complex polling parameters, if they use a polling mechanism. But I’ve been mainly interested in using prediction markets as public institutions for cases where there’s a lot of distrust re motives and rationality. Such as in law, governance, policy, academia, and science. And in such contexts, I worry a lot more about the discretionary powers required to implement an elite selection system. To see my concern, consider stock markets, whose main social function is to channel investment into the most valuable opportunities.","More accurate stock prices better achieve this function, and the above results suggest that we’d get much more accurate stock prices by greatly limiting who can speculate in stock markets. Hold some contests where applicants compete with fake trades to grow small initial trading budgets, and only let the top, say, 2% of such such contestants make speculative price-influencing trades in real stock markets. Maybe also force them to join teams, instead of trading individually. (Forcing extremization seems unnecessary, as specialists can profit by making those price adjustments.) (Note: these are my suggestions; study authors didn’t discuss this.) Yes, stock market speculators today are already far from randomly selected from the general population, and are thus already “elite” in that sense. Even so, while the 1300 forecasters in the above study were far random samples of the public, only letting the top 2% of them participate was a win in the above study. Thus only letting the top 2% of wannabe stock speculators trade in real stock markets is plausibly also a win for stock market price accuracy. (Note: the study authors admit they choose the 2% figure somewhat arbitrarily, so a wide range of selectivity, maybe 0.5% to 10%, might work about as well.) To prevent others from speculating, we might force hedging trades to be made via long-delay call markets, which pushes out speculators with shorter-fuse info, or via regulators verifying their legit hedging needs (e.g, regular paycheck deposit, withdraw for retirement, or big medical expense). And we might insist that hedgers focus on general index funds unless they can show reasons to trade more specific assets. One problem with this is that most of profits made by winning speculators today come from the losses of less elite speculators, not from hedge traders. And if we could better segregate hedge traders into call markets, elite speculator profits would be even smaller. Thus unless we could subsidize elite-only stock markets, perhaps via automated market makers, elite speculators would be fighting over a much smaller pool of profits than today, which would likely cut into price accuracy. Another problem is that it would be hard to prevent speculator contestants from privately buying winning trades, turning this elite selection process into more of a monetary auction. Other professional credentialing processes today use schools and tests, where it is harder to just buy success. But even if we can prevent contest cheating, and subsidize elite stock market speculation, I fear corruption of elite speculator certification. That is, the official organization in charge of deciding who qualifies as elite speculators may succumb to pressures to favor some groups, and to be overly restrictive to favor insiders. And once you imagine official consensus on legal, policy, or science questions being set by financial markets prices, you can imagine all the more possible pressures to control who is allowed to influence such prices. For now, I recommend that robust public institutions built using financial markets let as many parties as possible trade in them, even","But the way they are structured, they have no such thing as an elite selection. The market is a decentralized system. There are no insiders or insiders' proxies. The market is not a public institution. So, the stock market is a public institution (as is the prediction market) but it is not a public institution in the sense of a democratic institution. The market is a market, not a government. But in the stock market, the system is not designed to select the best investors, it is designed to aggregate information. That is, the market is a system that is designed to aggregate information, not to select the best. So, in a stock market, if you are trying to make the market work better, you might want to have more people, not fewer. Whereas in a prediction market, you might want to have fewer people, not more. The authors of the paper have shown that for prediction markets, with a given number of participants, the accuracy of the market is higher when participants are more elite. So, if you have a prediction market with 1000 participants, and you have a way of selecting 100 elite participants, and you can get the 100 elite participants to participate, then the market will be more accurate than if you had 1000 non-elite participants. But how do you get the 100 elite participants to participate? That is, the question is, is it possible to have a prediction market that is both a public institution (in the sense of democratic, public, government-like) and also has the property that the market is accurate, even when the market is not designed to select the best participants? That is, can a prediction market be a public institution, and still have the property that the market is accurate? In other words, can the market be a public institution that is not designed to select the best participants, but is designed to aggregate information, and still be accurate? That is",496,500,330,0.2372,0.2506,0.9744,0.8944,0.949,0.8912,1.1779,-2.3836,0.3284,0.3087,0.0246,0.0282,0.001,0.0012,0.6046,0.5149,0.9676,0.9273,0.34305317324185247,0.32582322357019067,0.49736842105263157,6,5,0.994,0.9579,0.14112903225806453,0.142,0.15757575757575756,0.9251,0.485,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Thinkers Must Be Heretics.txt,"When we form opinions on topics, the depth of our efforts vary. On some topics we put in no effort, and hold no opinions. On other topics, we notice what are the opinions of standard authorities, and adopt those. We often go further to learn of some arguments offered by such authorities, and mostly accept those arguments. Sometimes we feel contrarian and make up an opinion we know to be contrary to standard ones. Sometimes we instead seek out non-standard authorities that we more respect, and adopt their opinions and maybe also arguments. Contrarian authorities often explicitly mention and rebut the arguments of standard authorities, and sometimes we also learn and adopt those counter-arguments. Sometimes we try to learn about many arguments on a topic from many sides, and then try to compare and evaluate them more directly, paying less attention to how much we respect their sources. Sometimes we generate our own arguments to add to this mix. Sometimes we do this alone, and sometimes in collaboration with close associates. Compared to the other approaches mentioned above, this last set of approaches can be described as more “thinking for ourselves”. In general, arguments try to draw conclusions from widely accept claims and assumptions. So to dig deeper, we can recurse, by taking the claims X used to support arguments on topic T, and treat some of those X as new topics to consider in this same way. Our associates are interested in judging how well we think, and we are eager to impress them. And as all of these effort levels are appropriate in various practical cases, in principle our associates should want to judge our abilities at all of these different levels. However, as we tend to see deeper thinking as harder, where our thinking skills matter more, and the more usual practical task, as authorities haven’t spoken to most of the practical issues we face, we are more eager to demonstrate and judge abilities to do deeper thinking. Thus we all tend to present ourselves as thinking more deeply than we actually do. Not arbitrarily deeply, which isn’t believable. But maybe as deep as is plausible in a given case. So we tend to present ourselves, when possible, as “thinking for ourselves”. Note that this thinking-for-yourself approach plausibly produces less accurate and reliable beliefs on each particular topic. Most people are usually less able to integrate info and arguments into an accurate total opinion than is the collective action of the usual authorities. Even so, showing off your abilities, and improving them via practice, often matters more to us than accuracy on each topic. We might be collectively better off due to us all doing more thinking, but this isn’t obvious. We could of course get both accuracy and practice in thinking if we’d do our own analysis, but then adopt authority opinions even when that disagreed with our personal analysis. But we rarely do that, as we consider it “insincere” and “two-faced”.","Thinking-for-yourself, however, has a big problem on topics where there are orthodox opinions, opinions on which all good thinking people in some community are supposed to agree. The problem is that thinking for yourself is usually noisy and context-dependent. That is, the process of thinking for ourselves doesn’t consistently produce the same outputs given the same inputs. Many random factors re what arguments we notice, and how we framed or ordered our thoughts, often substantially influence our conclusions. And thus people who think for themselves must be expected to reach contrarian conclusions a substantial (~5-50%) fraction of the time. Note that people who want to create the impression that they think for themselves, without putting in the effort of actually doing so, can just randomly adopt contrarian conclusions at roughly this rate. And this does seem to be the strategy of most ordinary people, who have quite high rates of variation in their opinions, and yet who don’t seem to think very deeply. Their opinions even vary widely across time, as they usually can’t recall the random opinions that they generated even a few months before. However, this rate of variation is a much bigger problem for people whose opinions are more prominent. If someone publicly states their think-for-themself conclusions on twenty orthodox-adjacent topics, they should expect an average of ~1-10 heressy-adjacent opinions in that set. Yet often a prominent enough person publicly seeming to endorse even a single heresy is enough to get them cancelled in a community. Such as losing their job, or any chance for advancement or entry into that community. What to do? One traditional solution has been for the usual authorities to present themselves as focused on particular topics associated with their positions of authority, and not thinking for themselves on most other topics. Especially re most orthodox topics. This was long the usual position of CEOs, for example. Another traditional solution was for scholars, who do often specialize as thinkers on topics at least adjacent to orthodox ones, to speak esoterically, i.e., evasively in public, and only frankly in private to other scholars. In our society today, however, a great many people present themselves as relatively prominent and thus worth cancelling, largely thinking for themselves even on orthodox-adjacent topics, offering their opinions in public on many such topics, and yet none of these public opinions are heresies. In fact they often express outrage when they encounter another such person expressing even a single heresy. But if they offer non-heresy opinions on twenty such topics, it is quite hard to believe that all those opinions are a random sample of their opinions generated by thinking for themselves; the natural rate of opinion variation due to thinking for yourself is just too high to produce such a result. Such people are probably being selective in what they say, or deceiving themselves into seeing themselves as thinking for themselves more than they actually do. And thus we reach the thesis in my title: thinkers must be heretics.","So, in our thinking, we often do not do the most accurate thing, but instead do the most socially appropriate thing. And in doing so, we often end up with less accurate and less reliable beliefs, even though the other approaches are often more accurate. So, even if the most accurate approach is more difficult, we still tend to go for the more socially appropriate one, even if it is less accurate. 

Now, let's take a real-world example. Let's say that you are a person in a room with a group of people who are all discussing a topic that is important to you. The topic is, for example, the effectiveness of a certain type of medical treatment. You have read about this treatment, and you have some opinions, but you are not sure of your position. You are aware that some people in the group are more expert in the field than you are, but you are also aware that some of them might not be the most reliable authorities. You are also aware that some people in the group are more confident in their opinions than others. You are trying to figure out how to contribute to the discussion in a way that is both accurate and socially appropriate. 

Now, let's consider the possible strategies that you might use to contribute to the discussion. You could, for example, adopt the opinion of a standard authority, which might be more accurate but might not be socially appropriate. Or you could adopt the opinion of a non-standard authority that you respect, which might be more socially appropriate but less accurate. Or you could try to think for yourself, which might be more accurate but might be socially inappropriate if others don't respect your opinion. Alternatively, you could try to find a balance between accuracy and social appropriateness, such as by presenting your opinion with some level of uncertainty or by seeking consensus. 

Now, let's consider the consequences of each of these strategies. If you adopt the opinion of a standard authority, you might be seen as reliable and",496,500,348,0.2825,0.2171,0.9685,0.9419,0.9052,0.9301,2.0353,1.4593,0.3744,0.424,0.0406,0.039,0.0069,0.0024,0.6087,0.6003,0.9467,0.9304,0.44991212653778556,0.44206773618538325,0.5063613231552163,6,5,0.9833,0.9786,0.125,0.134,0.13505747126436782,0.8619,0.7636,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,‘Long Reflection’ Is Crazy Bad Idea.txt,"Some futurist philosophers have recently become enthused by what seems to me a spectacularly bad idea. Here is their idea:
Some effective altruists … have argued that, if humanity succeeds in eliminating existential risk or reducing it to acceptable levels, it should not immediately embark on an ambitious and potentially irreversible project (such as space colonization) of arranging the universe’s resources in accordance to its values, but ought instead to spend considerable time— “centuries (or more)” (Ord 2020), “perhaps tens of thousands of years” (Greaves et al. 2019), “thousands or millions of years” (Dai 2019), “[p]erhaps… a million years” (MacAskill, in Perry 2018)—figuring out what is in fact of value. The long reflection may thus be seen as an intermediate stage in a rational long-term human developmental trajectory, following an initial stage of existential security when existential risk is drastically reduced and followed by a final stage when humanity’s potential is fully realized (Ord 2020). (More)
The long reflection. Perhaps it’s a period of a million years or something. We’ve got a lot of time on our hands. There’s really not the kind of scarce commodity, so there are various stages to get into that state. The first is to reduce extinction risks down basically to zero, put us a position of kind of existential security. The second then is to start developing a society where we can reflect as much as possible and keep as many options open as possible. William MacAskill
It seems that first comes computer science and global governance and coordination and strategy issues, and then comes long time of philosophy. Lucas Perry (more)
And here is Toby Old from his book The Precipice, quoted at length so we can all be very clear about what is this idea:
I find it useful to consider our predicament from humanity’s point of view: casting humanity as a coherent agent, … what all humans would do if we were sufficiently coordinated and had humanity’s long term interest at heart. … We should [proceed]… in three phases: 1. Reaching existential security 2. The long reflection 3. Achieving our potential … A place where existential risk is low and stays low. I call this existential security. …
This will involve major changes to our norms and institutions (giving humanity the prudence and patience we need), as well as ways of increasing our general resilience to catastrophe. … Take our time to reflect upon what we truly desire, … call this the Long Reflection. … What is essential is to be sufficiently confident in the broad shape of what we are among at before taking each bold and potentially irreversible action – each action that could plausibly lock in substantial aspects of your future trajectory. … For example, … genetically improving our biology … or giving people the freedom to adopt a stunning diversity of new biological forms. We could think of these first two steps of existential security and the Long Reflection as designing a constitution for humanity.","… We can’t rely on our current institutions and institution that have evolved to deal with small- or medium-scale risks. … Humanity typically manages risk via a heavy reliance on trial and error. …But this reactive trial and error approach doesn’t work at all when it comes to existential risk. …. This will require institutions with access to cutting edge information about the coming risks, capable of taking decisive actions, and with the will to actually do so. For many risks, this action may require swift coordination between many or all of the world’s nations. There would be benefits to centralizing some of this international work on safeguarding humanity. … Our options range from incremental improvements to minor agencies through to major changes to key bodies such as the UN Security Council, all th way up to entirely new institutions for governing the most important world affairs. … Some important early thinkers on existential risk suggested that the growing possibility of existential catastrophe required moving toward a form of world government. … But the term [world government] is also used to refer to a politically homogenized word with a single point of control (roughly, the world as one big country). This is much more contentious and could increase over existential risk via global totalitarianism, or by permanently locking in bad values. Instead my guess is that existential security could be better achieved with the bare minimum of internationally binding constraints needed to prevent actors in one or two countries from jeopardizing humanity’s future. Okay, they want to first greatly cut our risk of extinction, and then somehow stop irreversible change and have us talk and think for a very long time, after which we would then act again once we had reached a sufficiently strong consensus. But that’s kinda crazy, as discussed here by Felix Stocker: Is there any way humanity could reach a ‘Long Reflection’ period? Could we sustain it? Could it really discover the way to the ‘optimal’ future? … Can we actually eliminate x-risks without taking any momentous and irreversible decisions, … we would have to have radically different political and governmental structures – perhaps a global government, or a global hegemon … it seems really hard to achieve and sustain. … a significant number of individuals and groups would be forced to sacrifice short term gains … authoritarian political institutions would have to be developed which could prevent individuals and groups from acting in their own rational self-interest. … We couldn’t expect to be able to ‘solve moral philosophy’ just by doing it in a vacuum. … I’m struggling to see the Long Reflection as anything other than impossible and pointless. … If we genuinely could engage in a collective philosophy project for 10,000 years, why would we ever want to stop? In our world today, many small local choices are often correlated, across both people and time, and across actions, expectations, and desires. Within a few decades, such correlated changes often add up to changes","…
The third step, which I call “achieving our potential,” is when we start to make a substantial dent in the amount of value in the universe. … (More)
This is the “long reflection” idea. The idea is that humanity should delay any potentially irreversible, large-scale, and risky project, such as space colonization or biological enhancement, until after we have spent centuries or more on a long period of philosophical reflection, in order to determine what is actually of value, and then proceed with such projects once we have a clearer idea of what is of value. The reasoning is that this long reflection period allows us to get a better understanding of what is of value, and thus we can make better decisions in the long term.
The problem with this idea is that it is not at all clear that the long reflection would be effective in helping us determine what is of value. If anything, it seems that the longer we delay, the more likely we are to be making decisions that are suboptimal. This is because the longer we wait, the more time we have to be wrong, and the more time we have for the world to change in ways that make our current understanding of value obsolete. (More)
But then I think that the long reflection idea is not just problematic in terms of effectiveness, but also in terms of the moral philosophy that it is based on. If we think that we should delay potentially irreversible actions until we are sure of what is of value, then we are implicitly assuming that the values of the future will be different from the values of the present, and that we should be cautious about making irreversible decisions based on our current values. However, this is a very problematic assumption. (More)
In this essay, I want to challenge the long reflection idea, and to argue that the idea is not only ineffective, but also morally flawed.

Robin Hanson,Sincerity Adds To Drift.txt,"The 2008 book Ritual and Its Consequences: An Essay on the Limits of Sincerity is hard for me to understand, but I’ve been trying to figure it out, as the concepts it considers seem interesting and important:
In any ritual, as with saying please, performing the act marks acceptance of the convention. It does not matter how you may feel about the convention, if you identify with it or not. In doing a ritual the whole issue of our internal states is often irrelevant. … Getting it right is not a matter of making outer acts conform to inner beliefs. … In daily life there is often much pushing, screaming, grabbing of hairbrushes, not helping with the dinner or feeding the dog, and so on. The parents then decide that everyone has to treat each other with a bit more respect, more civility, more use of please and thank you. Many of us have experienced this and know that it works—at least for a time, until the please and thank you begin to get lost. Ratcheting up the amount of love everyone feels, on the other hand, is not the way to make life more pleasant in the household. There is no need, and it is not even possible. …
Ritual … is nondiscursive in the sense that it cannot be analyzed as a coherent system of beliefs. The meaning of ritual is the meaning produced through the ritual action itself. …
Building a better society, therefore, is based upon ritualization: creating a canon of practices that everyone should follow. And the criterion for which actions from the past should become part of that ritual canon is simply based
on whether a continued performance of them helps to refine one’s ability to respond to others. … there is no foundation, there are no overarching sets of guidelines, laws, or principles. There are only actions, and it is up to humans to ritualize some of those actions and thereby set up an ordered world. …
Sincerity often grows out of a reaction against ritual. It criticizes ritual’s acceptance of social convention as mere action (perhaps even just acting) without intent, as performance without belief. The alternatives it often suggests are categories that grow out of individual soul-searching rather than the acceptance of social conventions. Sincerity thus grows out of abstract and generalized categories generated within individual consciousness. The sincere mode of behavior seeks to replace the ‘‘mere convention’’ of ritual with a genuine and thoughtful state of internal conviction. …
From the point of view of sincerity, ritual is mere hypocrisy and convention. Viewed from ritual, however, sincerity can threaten the very existence of society by refusing its conventions. …
The Calvinist’s ‘‘Am I really saved?’’ and the teenager’s ‘‘Am I really in love?’’ are at heart similar kinds of questions.","After three decades of marriage, kids, laundry, mortgages, funerals, fights, and in-laws, the relationship tends to be sustained by [ritual] … Relationships that fail to … over the long term tend to fall apart. It is not enough to love each other sincerely if people fail to act as if they love each other; and acting as if they love each other includes ritualized forms of expressing concern, verbally and in concrete deeds of helpfulness. … Sincerity tries to resolve all ambiguity to forge a ‘‘pure’’ and ‘‘unsullied’’ consciousness. Fifty years ago in Russia or China it was the search for a ‘‘true’’ revolutionary consciousness. In the mid-nineteenth-century springtime of the peoples it was to be at one with the spirit of one’s folk, … Sartre’s … Iron in the Soul … showing the attraction of the workers’ movement … along with the self-loathing of those who could not master such unidirectional sense of self-purpose. … Both the scholarly community and commonsensical readings of world history … claim that traditional societies are governed by ritual—that is, by largely unquestioned external norms, customs, and forms of authority that regulate individual lives. In contrast, modern societies are seen as valuing individual autonomy, such that norms, customs, and authority are accepted only through the conscious choice of the rational individual. … [But] the opposite of ritual is not … individual autonomy. It is rather sincerity—the belief that truth resides within the authentic self, that it is coherent, and that incoherence and fragmentation are therefore themselves signs of insincerity. … ‘modern’ period, therefore, should instead be understood in part as a period in which sincerity claims have been given a rare institutional and cultural emphasis. … so pervasive have these sincerity claims become that even [fundamentalist] revolts against this so-called modern era are done in the name of finding ever-more-authentic forms of sincerity. (More) I may have finally made some sense of all this, in terms of a view I described four days ago: One simple way to [integrate economics and cultural evolution] is to pick an abstraction border level that separates the two. More detailed choices are made via optimization to implement heuristics, obey norms, and achieve subgoals that are set most abstractly by cultural evolution. For example, planning a route from A to B consists of searching for a path between them that minimizes a culture-chosen cost goal, prefers culture-chosen tech, avoids violating culture-set norms, and follows culture-inherited heuristic subpaths when available. … It seems that a big trend of the modern era has been to move this border to higher levels of abstraction … puts a higher premium on intelligence … faster actual rates of change … [but] has a problem of being harder to reliably copy … contribut[ing] to cultural drift. … Another implication of this mixed view is that once you dig into a person to a sufficient depth, their coherence will degrade a lot. Culturally inherited goals and habits are just going to be a lot less coherent","They are not questions about the object of the feeling but about the feeling itself. …
The problem with sincerity is that it is the search for an inner truth, a personal truth, and the way that inner truth is expressed is the only way that one can know that one has found it. …
Sincerity is a search for truth in the self. Ritual is a search for truth in the other. …
The problem with sincerity is that it can only be known in the moment of its expression. The moment of expression is the moment when the sincerity is known to be sincere. …
The problem with ritual is that it can be known in advance. The moment of expression is not the moment when the ritual is known to be a ritual. …
So the problem with ritual is that it can be known in advance, and thus the performance is not really an expression of the self. The problem with sincerity is that it can only be known in the moment of its expression. …
There is a kind of tension between these two modes. The problem with ritual is that it is known in advance. The problem with sincerity is that it is only known in the moment. So the question becomes: what is the better mode of expression? The one that is known in advance or the one that is known only in the moment? …
So the question becomes, what is the better mode of expression? The one that is known in advance or the one that is known only in the moment? …
The problem with ritual is that it can be known in advance. The problem with sincerity is that it is only known in the moment. …
I think that the problem with the concept of sincerity is that it is a kind of inner truth that can be known only in the moment of its expression, but it is the only way to know that it is sincere. That is, the only way to know that you are sincere is to have the experience of sincerity. But the experience",470,500,361,0.1193,0.1493,0.9792,0.9232,0.639,0.8547,10.5741,-2.72,0.2964,0.3375,0.0299,0.063,0.0022,0.0035,0.5928,0.503,0.9734,0.9549,0.4324817518248175,0.3758620689655172,0.5886889460154242,9,6,0.8956,0.873,0.11914893617021277,0.144,0.07756232686980609,0.9005,0.4169,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Sacred Inquiry.txt,"The reason I first started to study the sacred was that “sacred cows” kept getting in my way; our treating things as sacred often blocks sensible reforms. But now that I have a plausible theory of how and why we treat some things as sacred, I have to admit: I too treat some things as sacred. Maybe I should learn to stop that, but it seems hard. So perhaps we should accept the sacred as a permanent feature of human thought, and instead try to change what we see as how sacred or how exactly we do that. So it seems worth my trying to describe in more detail how I see something as sacred, not just habitually but even after I notice this fact. In this post, that thing will be: intellectual inquiry. In this post I’ll mostly try to describe how I revere this, and not so much ask whether I should. All the thinking and talking that happens in the world helps us to do many things, and to figure out many things. And while some of those things are pretty concrete and content-dependent, others are less so, helping us to learn more general stuff whose usefulness plausibly extends further into the future. And this I call “intellectual progress”. In general, all of the thinking and talking that we do contributes to this progress, even though it is done for a wide variety of motives, and via many different forms of social organization. I should welcome and celebrate it all. And while abstractly, I do, I notice that, emotionally, I don’t. It seems that I instead deeply want to distinguish and revere a particular more sacred sort of thinking and talking from the rest. And instead of assuming that my favored type is just very rare, hardly of interest to anyone but me, I instead presume that a great many of us are trying to produce my favored type, even if most fail at it. Which can let me presume that most must know how to do better, and thus justify my indignant stance toward those who fail to meet my standards. This sort of thinking and talking that I revere is that which actually achieves substantial and valuable progress in abstract understanding, and is done in a way to effectively and primarily achieve this goal. Thus I see as “profane” work that appears to be greatly influenced by other purposes, such as showing off one’s impressiveness, or assuring associates of loyalty. That is, I have a sacred purity norm, where I don’t like my pure sacred stuff mixed up with other stuff. Good stuff not only has to achieve good outcomes, it also has to be done the right way for the right reasons. I tend to simplify this category and its boundary, and presume that it can be distinguished clearly. I feel bound to others who share my norms, even if I can’t actually name any of them.","I don’t calculate most of this; it instead comes intuitively, and seems aesthetically elegant. And I can’t recall ever choosing all this; it feels like I was always this way. Now on reflection this has a lot of specific implications re what I find more sacred or profane, as I have a lot of beliefs about which intellectual topics are more valuable, and what are more effective methods. And I’ll get to those soon here. But first let me note that while many intellectuals also see their professional realm as sacred, and have many similar sacred norms about how their work should be done, most of them don’t apply such norms nearly as strongly to their personal lives. In contrast, I extend this to all my thinking and talking. That is, while I’m okay with engaging in many kinds of thinking and talking, I want to sharply distinguish some sacred versions, where all these sacred norms apply, and try to actually use them often in my personal life. Okay, I can think of a lot of specific implications this has for what I respect and criticize. The following is a somewhat random list of what occurs to me at the moment. For example, I take academic papers to be implicitly claiming to promote intellectual progress. This implies that they should try to be widely available for others to critique and build on. So I dislike papers that are less available, or that use needlessly difficult languages or styles. Or that aren’t as forthcoming or concise as they could re what theses they argue, to allow readers to judge interest on that basis. I dislike intentional use of vague terms when clearer terms were available, and switching between word meanings to elude criticism. I feel that a paper which cites another is claiming that it got some particular key input from that other paper, and a paper that cites nothing is claiming to have not needed such inputs. So I disapprove of papers that fail to cite key inputs, or that substitute a more prestigious source for the less prestigious source from which they actually got their input. I see a paper on a topic as implicitly claiming that the topic is some rough approximation to the best topic they could have chosen, and a paper using a method that some rough approximation to the best method. So it bothers me when it seems obvious the topic isn’t so good, or when the method seems poorly chosen. I’m also bothered when the length of some writing seems poorly matched to the thesis presented. For example, if a thesis could have been adequately argued in a paper, then I’m bothered if its in a book with lots of tangential stuff added on to fill out the space. I find it profane when authors seem to be pushing an agenda via selective choice of arguments, evidence, or terminology. They should acknowledge weak points and rebuttals of which they are aware without making readers","I feel that I must not only respect but also revere those who do it well. I think that the sacred is the kind of thinking and talking that is aimed at achieving progress in understanding, and is done in a way that is effective and primarily for that purpose. I think that this is the sort of thing that is not only valuable, but also sacred, in the sense that it is the kind of thing that is worth doing for its own sake. So I feel like I should be doing it more. But I also feel that I should be doing it less. I feel that I should be doing it more because it is valuable and worth doing. I feel that I should be doing it less because it is sacred, and I feel that I am not doing it well, and I feel that I should be doing it better. So I have a conflict between these two impulses. I think that the author is trying to reconcile the tension between their desire to pursue intellectual inquiry as a sacred pursuit and their awareness of the need to be more effective and less self-indulgent. The author’s main argument seems to be that intellectual inquiry is sacred because it is aimed at achieving progress in understanding, and it is done in a way that is effective and primarily for that purpose. The author is also trying to argue that while this kind of thinking is valuable, it is also sacred, and thus should be done for its own sake. The author is also trying to reconcile the tension between their desire to pursue this sacred pursuit and their awareness that they are not doing it well, and that they should be doing it better. The author is also trying to argue that the sacred is a permanent feature of human thought, and that we should accept it as such, and instead focus on how we treat things as sacred. The author is also trying to argue that we should not be overly critical of those who fail to meet the standards of this sacred pursuit, but instead recognize that many are trying to do it,",493,500,369,0.2064,0.3467,0.9833,0.9544,0.9804,0.8559,0.4545,3.8182,0.3794,0.4346,0.039,0.0924,0.0085,0.0283,0.7891,0.7174,0.986,0.9716,0.47686832740213525,0.4787234042553192,0.5919395465994962,7,5,0.9943,0.9891,0.10953346855983773,0.092,0.07317073170731707,0.963,0.6282,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,My Status Circles.txt,"Most of us have circles of concern, where we care more about folks from our inner circles than our outer circles. And relative to conservatives, liberals care more about their outer circle folks. Status is a consensus measure of personal worth, and respect, shared by some community. And our status markers also seem to vary with these circles of concern; we respect differently in different circles. In this post, I want to illustrate this by trying to describe my personal circles and their differing status markers. I suspect this to be a neglected but valuable exercise. By telling the world directly what your community respects, you might induce them to change what they respect, or to join your community. My widest circle includes all life in the universe. More narrow is all the life that will descend from life on Earth, including AIs. More narrow still are Earth lineages (both DNA and cultural) that I embody and descend from, and which will descend from us. For these wider circles I mostly accept their existing status makers, most of which do point to good things. I do put a bit more weight than most on biological adaptiveness, but otherwise I mainly bother to argue weights re my smaller circles. The smaller circles for most people include their species and related bio groupings, continents, nations, acquaintances, friends, and family. But I strongly identify as an intellectual, so I focus on intellectual-type circles. I don’t think everyone should be an intellectual, so I don’t want everyone to join this circle, and I want intellectuals and others to respect and complement each other. In the widest circle of intellectuals, the focus is on “winning” the usual markers by which intellectuals are celebrated in our world. Such as fame, popularity, attention, money, and prestige markers like jobs, publications, keynote talks, etc. Most who win do so via placing most of their weight on winning, both personally and re status. Relative to such folks, my smaller circles care more about original insight: did someone actually contribute to our world learning more about neglected important topics? That is, we judge contributions by their marginal impact on our total understanding. Yes the two are correlated, but they aren’t the same. As there is so much variance in individual contributions, someone’s best single contribution is often a good proxy for the magnitude of their total contributions, and it seems much easier to judge. So even though this may induce modest distortions, it often makes sense to focus on a person’s best few contributions. Yes, there is also value in the world’s intellectuals ensuring that we don’t forget things we once knew, and ensuring that the wider world can access our insights. But given the magnitude of existing efforts into such things, my circle puts more weight on generating insights and communicating them to others who might build on them.","(For small practical innovations, the situation is reversed; there diffusion is neglected relative to invention.) Many intellectuals pursue their efforts as hobbyists and collectors, mostly for the fun of it, to avoid boredom. Many count that motive as higher than those who try to win, but I can only credit that as being a bit less likely to go wrong than win motives often do, via things like mutual admiration societies. One principle of incentive metrics, including status markers, is that it can sometimes help to put weight on a lower noise proxy which correlates with a higher noise more fundamental value. So if the features of intelligence, knowledge, intellectual honesty, and openness to engaging critics tend to promote intellectual progress, but have less noise to estimate, it can be worth putting status weight on those features directly, for the purpose of promoting and estimating intellectual progress. Yes, there is a danger of putting too much weight on them. One key proxy on which my circles put more weight is: directly trying to make progress on important neglected topics, based on explicit analysis of this question. Most intellectuals fall into their topics, or cue off of signs of topic profitability, popularity, or prestige. If you ask them directly why their topics are important and neglected, they are mostly surprised to hear the question, and usually make up shallow rationales showing they haven’t considered the question much. So I very much respect folks who deliberately try to, and successfully do, make progress on important neglected topics. But most of those who have an explicit analysis of why their topics are especially promising did that long ago, and haven’t reconsidered this much since then. My most inner circle is thus reserved for those who keep re-asking this question, and actually change their mind on it over decades. I have personally found that over my lifetime I learned a great deal about what topics were important and neglected, as I kept digging into them. I found that some apparent problems were really caused more by different underlying problems. And I found that new concepts and frameworks changed what I saw as the most pivotal questions and claims. These weren’t small changes, and I don’t see how to short circuit this process; it happens at the speed of understanding. My experience seems robust enough that I just can’t believe that it’s very atypical. If you are paying attention, you will change your mind in big ways on what seems how interesting and neglected. And if you act on that, you will substantially change your topics. My inner circle is thus composed of folks who take and respect this stance. As such folks often move across disciplines, they are often called “polymaths”. So, to summarize, I respect most creatures in the universe according to the usual status markers of their communities, though I put more weight than most on adaptiveness. I see myself as in a smaller circle of intellectuals, wherein we especially respect those","In this post I want to talk about my circles of concern, and what I think they should value. I want to be clear that I am not saying that all other circles should value what I value. I am saying that in my own circles, I value these things. I think that in my own circles, the value of original insight is more important than the usual markers of success that we see in our world. But I want to be clear that I don’t think that all of the usual success markers are bad, but that I think they are secondary. I think that the value of original insight is more important than the usual success markers. But I think that the value of the other success markers are still important. So the question is, how do we balance the two? How do we ensure that we don’t lose the original insights, but also that we don’t lose the other markers? How do we ensure that the people who are not in our circles (and are not in our circles of concern) don’t get left behind? This is a difficult question, but I think it is worth thinking about. I think that in order to balance the two, we need to have a more integrated approach to success, where both original insight and the other success markers are valued. But how do we do that? What is the right way to integrate them? I think that the key is to understand that the two are not mutually exclusive. They are both important, and they can be pursued together. I think that in the future, we might see a shift in how we value success, where original insight is given more weight than the usual success markers. I think that this is a positive direction, but I also think that it is important to not lose the other markers. I think that this is a delicate balance, and that we need to be careful in how we approach it. I think that the way to do this is to create a culture that values both original insight and the other",480,500,361,0.2398,0.2102,0.9775,0.9222,0.8855,0.9349,2.5235,-1.27,0.4113,0.3801,0.0335,0.0508,0.0064,0.0141,0.4257,0.6065,0.9838,0.9627,0.42704626334519574,0.4337979094076655,0.5717821782178217,8,5,0.999,0.953,0.13958333333333334,0.122,0.09695290858725762,0.9368,0.5816,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Cycles of War & Empire.txt,"I’ve just read five of Peter Turchin’s books: Historical Dynamics (2003), War & Peace & War (2006), Secular Cycles (2009), Ultra Society (2015), and Ages of Discord (2016). Four of them in the last week. I did this because I love careful big picture thinking, and Turchin is one of the few who does this now on the big question of historical cycles of conflict and empire. While historians today tend to dislike this sort of analysis, Turchin defies them, in part because he’s officially a biologist. I bow to honor his just defiance and careful efforts. Turchin’s main story is a modest variation on related farmer-era historical cycle stories, such as by Jack Goldstone in 1991, & Ibn Khaldun in 1377 (!):
Different groups have different degrees of cooperation .. cohesiveness and solidarity. .. Groups with high [cohesion] arise on .. frontier .. area where an imperial boundary coincides with a fault line between two [ethnic] communities .. places where between group competition is very intense. .. Only groups possessing high levels of [cohesion] can construct large empires. .. Stability and internal peace bring prosperity, and prosperity causes population increase .. leads to overpopulation, .. causes lower wages, higher land rents, and falling per capital incomes. At first, low wages and high rents bring unparalleled wealth to the upper class, but as their numbers and appetites grow, they also begin to suffer from falling incomes. Declining standards of life breed discontent and strife. The elites turn to the state for employment and additional income and drive up its expenditures at the same time that the tax revenue declines. .. When the state’s finances collapse, it loses the control of the army and police. Freed from all restraints, strife among the elites escalates into civili war, while the discontent among the poor explodes into popular rebellions. The collapse of order brings .. famine, war, pestilence, and death. .. Population declines and wages increase, while rents decline. .. Fortunes of the upper classes hit bottom. .. Civil wars thin the ranks of the elites. .. Intra-elite competition subsides, allowing the restoration of order. Stability and internal peace bring prosperity, and another cycle begins. (pp.5-8 W&P&W)
Turchin (& coauthor Nefedov) collect much data to show that this is a robust farmer-era pattern, even if there are many deviations. For example, in Europe, 33 of 43 frontier situations gave rise to big empires, yet only 4 of 57 of non-frontier situations did (p.84 HD). “Secular cycles” vary in duration from one to four centuries; Western Europe saw 8 cycles in 22 centuries, while China saw 8 cycles in 21 centuries (p.306,311 SC). During the low instability part of each cycle, instability shows a rough “alternating generations” 50 year cycle of conflict. I’ll grant that Turchin seems to have documented a reasonably broad pattern, containing most of his claimed elements. Yes, empires tend to start from frontier groups with high cohesion, and core cohesion changes slowly.","First there’s war success and a growing area and population, and bigger cities. Eventually can come crowding and falling wages. Inequality also grows, with more richer elites, and this is quite robust, continuing even after wages fall. While the amount of external war doesn’t change over the cycle, success in war falls. Many signs of social cohesion decline, and eventually there’s more elite infighting, with crime, duels, misspending state revenue, mistreatment of subordinates, and eventually civil war. Big wars can cut population, and also elite numbers and wealth. Eventually war abates and cohesion rises, though not to as high as when the empire started. A new cycle may begin; empires go through 1-3 cycles before being displaced by another empire. Just as science fiction is often (usually?) an allegory about issues today, I suspect that historians who blame a particular fault for the fall of the Roman Empire tend to pick faults that they also want to warn against in their own era. Similarly, my main complain about Turchin is that he attributes falling cohesion mainly to increased inequality – an “overproduction” of elites who face “increased competition”. Yes, inequality is much talked about among elites today, but the (less-forager-like) ancients were less focused on it. As Scheidel said in The Great Leveler, inequality doesn’t seem to cause civil wars, and civil wars tend to increase inequality during and after the war (p.203). External wars reduce inequality for losers and increase it for winners, without changing it much overall. It is only big mass mobilization wars of the 1900s that seem to clearly cause big falls in inequality. In biology, over multiple generations organisms slowly accumulate genetic mutations, which reduce their fitness. But this degradation is countered by the fact that nature and mates select for better organisms, which have fewer mutations. Similarly, it seems to me that the most straightforward account of the secular cycle is to say since empire founders are selected out of a strong competition for very high cohesion, we should expect cohesion to “regress to the mean” as an empire evolves. That is, in order to predict most of the observed elite misdeeds later in the secular cycle, all we need to assume is a random walk in cohesion that tends to fall back to typical levels. Yes, we might want to include other effects in our model. For example, civil war may allow a bit more selection for subgroups with more cohesion, and humans may have a psychological inclination to cohere more during and after a big war. But mostly we should just expect cohesion to decline from its initial extreme value, and that’s all a simple model needs. Yes, Turchin claims that we know more about what causes cohesion declines. But while he goes to great effort to show that the data fit his story on which events happen in what order during cycles, I didn’t see him offering evidence to support his claim that inequality causes less cohesion. He just repeatedly gives","So far, I can’t see a clear, direct contradiction between Turchin’s model and the data he presents. But then, he also has a theory of “ultra societies” (from the 1980s on) which are more complex than the ones of the farmer era. He has a model of how these are formed, and then how they collapse, and the resulting “dark age” that comes. But he also has a theory of the “dark age” as being an opportunity for a new ultra society to arise. But what’s the difference between the “dark age” and the low point of the cycle? Turchin’s model for the dark age is more like the low point of the cycle, but also more like the beginning of the cycle. So the dark age is the time between the collapse of an empire and the rise of a new one, but he says that it’s the same time as the low point of the cycle. This is a bit confusing. I’m not sure if this is a problem with his model or not. But given that he has a very strong data set, and a clear and coherent story, I’m inclined to accept the model, even if the terminology is a bit confusing. So the big picture is that there are cycles of imperial rise and fall, with a long-term cycle of 500-600 years, and shorter cycles of 50 years. So, for example, the rise of the Roman Empire (as a “first wave” of empires) began in the 1st century CE, but the collapse in the 5th century CE. Then the rise of the Byzantine Empire in the 6th century CE, and collapse in the 15th century. Then the rise of the Holy Roman Empire in the 10th century CE, and collapse in the 15th century. Then the rise of the Ottoman Empire in the 14",492,500,309,0.2635,0.1296,0.9624,0.9019,0.6751,0.6234,6.3607,7.9838,0.3322,0.2658,0.0317,0.0389,0.0011,0.0026,0.5087,0.6382,0.9221,0.9281,0.28618968386023297,0.3797250859106529,0.4891304347826087,7,6,0.8984,0.9029,0.2621951219512195,0.136,0.11974110032362459,0.8659,0.5442,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Kaczynski’s Collapse Theory.txt,"Many people argue that we should beware of foreigners, and people from other ethnicities. Beware of visiting them, trading with them, talking to them, or allowing them to move here. The fact that so many people are willing to argue for such conclusions is some evidence in favor of them. But the fact that the arguments offered are so diverse, and so often contradict one another, takes away somewhat from the strength of this evidence. This pattern looks like people tend to have a preconceived conclusion for which they opportunistically embrace any random arguments they can find. Similarly, many argue that we should be wary of future competition, especially if that might lead to concentrations of power. I recently posted on my undergrad law & econ students’ largely incoherent fears of one group taking over the entire solar system, and how Frederick Engels expresses related fears back in 1844. And I’ve argued on this blog with my ex-co-blogger regarding his concerns that if future AI results from competing teams, one team might explode to suddenly take over the world. In this post I’ll describe Ted “Unabomber” Kaczynski’s rather different theory on why we should fear competition leading to concentration, from his recent book Anti Tech Revolution. Kaczynski claims that the Fermi paradox, i.e., the fact that the universe looks dead everywhere, is explained by the fact that technological civilizations very reliably destroy themselves. When this destruction happens naturally, it is so thorough that no humans could survive. Which is why his huge priority is to find a way to collapse civilization sooner, so that at least some humans survive. Even a huge nuclear war is preferable, as at least some people survive that. Why must everything collapse? Because, he says, natural-selection-like competition only works when competing entities have scales of transport and talk that are much less than the scale of the entire system within which they compete. That is, things can work fine when bacteria who each move and talk across only meters compete across an entire planet. The failure of one bacteria doesn’t then threaten the planet. But when competing systems become complex and coupled on global scales, then there are always only a few such systems that matter, and breakdowns often have global scopes. Kaczynski dismisses the possibility that world-spanning competitors might anticipate the possibility of large correlated disasters, and work to reduce their frequency and mitigate their harms. He says that competitors can’t afford to pay any cost to prepare for infrequent problems, as such costs hurt them in the short run. This seems crazy to me, as most of the large competing systems we know of do in fact pay a lot to prepare for rare disasters. Very few correlated disasters are big enough to threaten to completely destroy the whole world. The world has had global scale correlation for centuries, with the world economy growing enormously over that time.","And yet we’ve never even seen a factor of two decline, while at least thirty factors of two would be required for a total collapse. And while it should be easy to test Kaczynski’s claim in small complex systems of competitors, I know of no supporting tests. Yet all dozen of the reviews I read of Kaczynski’s book found his conclusion here to be obviously correct. Which seems to me evidence that a great many people find the worry about future competitors to be so compelling that they endorse most any vaguely plausible supporting argument. Which I see as weak evidence against that worry. Yes of course correlated disasters are a concern, even when efforts are made to prepare against them. But its just not remotely obvious that competition makes them worse, or that all civilizations are reliably and completely destroyed by big disasters, so much so that we should prefer to start a big nuclear war now that destroys civilization but leaves a few people alive. Surely if we believed his theory a better solution would be to break the world into a dozen mostly isolated regions. Kaczynski does deserve credit for avoiding common wishful thinking in some of his other discussion. For example, he says that we can’t much control the trajectory of history, both because it is very hard to coordinate on the largest scales, and because it is hard to estimate the long term consequences of many choices. He sees how hard it is for social movements to actually achieve anything substantial. He notes that futurists who expect to achieve immortality and then live for a thousand years too easily presume that a fast changing competitive world will still have need for them. And while I didn’t see him actually say it, I expect he’s the sort of person who’d make the reasonable argument that individual humans are just happier in a more forager-like world. Kaczynski isn’t stupid, and he’s more clear-headed than most futurists I read. Too bad his low mood leans him so strongly to embrace a poorly-argued inevitable collapse story. Some book quotes on his key claim: In any environment that is sufficiently rich, self-propagating systems will arise, and natural selection will lead to the evolution of self-propagating systems having increasingly complex, subtle, and sophisticated means of surviving and propagating themselves. … In the short term, natural selection favors self propagating systems that pursue their own short-term advantage with little or no regard for long-term consequences. … Self-propagating subsystems of a given supersystem tend to become dependent on the supersystem and on the specific conditions that prevail within the supersystem. … In the event of the destruction of the supersystem or of any drastic acceleration of changes in the conditions prevailing within the supersystem, the subsystems can neither survive nor propagate themselves. … But as long as the supersystem exists and remains more or less stable, natural selection … disfavors those subsystems that “waste” some of their resources in preparing themselves to survive","So Kaczynski’s theory seems to me to be more of a metaphorical than a literal explanation. But even if it were literal, the question is, why should we care about that? Well, maybe we should be wary of future competition. But then again, maybe not. The question is, how do we decide which of these views is more correct? The fact that so many people have such views is some evidence in favor of them. But the fact that so many people have them is also some evidence against them. But in the absence of good evidence, the burden of proof is on those who are asserting these views. I think the best approach is to ask, what would be the cost of being wrong about this? If the theory that we should be wary of future competition is correct, then the cost of being wrong is that we might be overwhelmed by competition, leading to the concentration of power and possibly catastrophic outcomes. But if the theory that we shouldn’t be wary is correct, then the cost of being wrong is that we might be too cautious, not allowing competition to develop, and possibly missing out on innovation, economic growth, and other positive outcomes. The problem is, in the real world, we can’t really know which is more likely. We can’t just look back to see whether the world has been a success or a failure. The problem is that the future is so complex and unpredictable that it’s difficult to make accurate predictions. The question is, then, what do we do? If we are to be rational, then we should try to find the best possible evidence, and then make decisions based on that. But in the absence of good evidence, we can’t do much.

Robin Hanson,Specific vs. General Foragers & Farmers.txt,"Scott Alexander in 2013:
Rightism is what happens when you’re optimizing for surviving an unsafe environment, leftism is what happens when you’re optimized for thriving in a safe environment. … “Take actions that would be beneficial to survival in case of a zombie apocalypse” seems to get us rightist positions on a lot of issues. We can generalize from zombie apocalypses to any desperate conditions in which you’re not sure that you’re going to make it and need to succeed at any cost. What about the opposite? Let’s imagine a future utopia of infinite technology. Robotic factories produce far more wealth than anyone could possibly need. … Even death itself has disappeared. What policies are useful for this happy state? …
If the brain finds itself in a stable environment where everything is abundant, it sort of lowers the mental threat level and concludes that everything will always be okay and its job is to enjoy itself and win signaling games. If it finds itself in an environment of scarcity, it will raise the mental threat level and set its job to “survive at any cost”. … Leftism wins over time because technology advances over time which means societies become more secure and abundant over time. …
Both Greece and Rome were relatively leftist, with freedom of religion, democratic-republican governments, weak gender norms, minimal family values, and a high emphasis on education and abstract ideas. After the Fall of Rome, when Europe was set back technologically into a Dark Age, rightism returned with a vengeance. …
“So you mean rightism is optimized for tiny unstable bands facing a hostile wilderness, and leftism is optimized for secure, technologically advanced societies like the ones we are actually in?” And this conclusion, too, I will mostly endorse. (more)
Much of this is pretty compatible with the forager-farmer perspective I outlined in 2010. To review, as foragers our attitudes and inclinations were well adapted to our environment, but the farming environment was so different that to become effective farmers we had to drastically change such things in a short time. So we cranked up the pressure on social conformity, religion, etc. in order to enforce strong new social norms favoring new farming behaviors. But because these were built on fear, and went somewhat against our deeper natures, rich safe elites have often drifted back toward forager styles, and the whole world has drifted that way together since we’ve all gotten rich and safe with industry. This view makes sense of many long term trends over the last few decades, such as trends toward more leisure, travel, product variety, egalitarianism, democracy, peace, and slavery aversion. However, in addition to the forager-farmer or survive-thrive distinction, there is another related distinction that I think I, and Scott above, haven’t been thinking clearly enough about. And that is the distinction between supporting specific ways of foragers and farmers, and generalizing their attitudes toward simpler more general principles. Let me explain.","Specific farming norms were typically effective ways to avoid specific bad things in the farming world. It isn’t so much that farmers had a general norm that said “we must do whatever is necessary to survive.” Instead, they lived in a harsh world and their specific norms helped them to survive in that world. To the extent that the world has changed, some of those behaviors may no longer actually be effective and helping people to survive. As people became rich, the social norms from their farming societies often didn’t feel so compelling compared to feelings that often arose telling people what they wanted, and what was right. But these rich reversion feelings were vague, uncertain, and more similar around the world. They weren’t reverting to some specific set of forager norms learned from some specific forager society. So the new attitudes that arose in the newly rich in each different places were more similar to each other than were the farming attitudes in those different places. These new attitudes were also less specific, and hence more abstract and general. While some groups have tried to return to specific forager ways of life, the new foragers have overall been tentative and selective regarding which forager ways to adopt. For example, they’ve been more eager to adopt forager attitudes toward leisure than toward work, since rejecting industry working styles threatens to kill the golden goose that lets them indulge these forager attitudes. To deal with their hesitancy and selectivity, the new foragers have often talked about letting each person do what feels authentic and right to them. Which they actually do to a limited extent, and which fits nicely with the new forager emphasis on product and behavioral variety. If we try to generalize as far as possible from specific forager and farmer attitudes, we might find the general forager saying that what is important is how you feel inside, which you should hold fast to. The world is mostly a rich and pliable place, and so you and society should focus on trying to arrange that world so that we can each feel good inside. In contrast, we might find the general farmer saying that the world is a harsh place and hard to change, and so we should focus more on figuring out how to change ourselves to best deal with that world, to survive in the face of harsh obstacles and competition. Both of these general positions are substantially different from the typical left and right positions we see in our world. This is because most people do not actually generalize very far. People on the right tend to just support the specific farming society social norms that they have inherited, while people on the left generalize a bit more, but still do not actually want everyone to just do what feels good to them – most of them very much want the right sorts of things to feel good to you. So they in practice support a","The forager-farmer model is, in part, an explanation of how the world got to be the way it is, but it is also a model for how we might change it. The question is, what do we want to do? Do we want to go back to a forager way of life? Or do we want to go back to the values of the forager way of life? That is, do we want to re-orient our social institutions to be more forager-like in their values, or do we want to actually live like foragers? The former is more in line with the idea of “leftism” (as I understand it), and the latter is more in line with the idea of “rightism” (as I understand it). But I think that the original distinction between rightism and leftism in the post is a bit more nuanced than that. Because in the case of the forager-farmer model, the foragers had their own values. And the farmers had their own values. The question is not so much whether we want to be foragers or farmers, but whether we want to be more like the foragers or more like the farmers. So in that sense, the original distinction between rightism and leftism in the post was not so much about the question of “which lifestyle we want,” but about the question of “which attitude toward the world we want.” So the question is not whether we should live like foragers or farmers, but whether we should think like foragers or farmers. Which is a different question. So if we want to live like foragers, that’s one thing. If we want to live like farmers, that’s another. But if we want to think like foragers, that’s a different question. And that is the question that Scott was trying to get at in the post. So, the question is, are we optimizing for survival in a hostile environment or for thriving in a safe",492,500,327,0.1651,0.1427,0.9409,0.9297,0.8234,0.896,4.4417,-2.1528,0.3326,0.3749,0.0204,0.0383,0.0,0.0083,0.2627,0.4335,0.9717,0.9589,0.38879159369527144,0.4562043795620438,0.5264550264550265,7,7,0.9685,0.9835,0.13008130081300814,0.078,0.12844036697247707,0.6928,0.4506,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Futarchy Details.txt,"I started to write on prediction markets, which I then called “idea futures”, about 34 years ago. A bit over 25 years ago, in the May/June issue of IEEE Intelligent Systems, I published on Decision Markets, with my main example being how they could answer the question of the effect of concealed firearm carry laws on murder rates (an issue where empirical literatures still seems unclear). A year later I posted the first version of my paper Shall We Vote on Values, But Bet on Beliefs?, later published in the Journal of Political Philosophy, which presented basically the same concept in the more prestigious context of running an entire government. Since then I have written many things on the decision markets concept, and tried to pitch it to anyone who’d talk to me about prediction markets. In 2003, Hal Varian wrote a NYT article on decision markets, and they were mentioned in the NYT again in 2008, when the NYT also quite prematurely listed it as an official buzzword of that year. Also in 2008, Peter McCluskey did a trial re that year’s US presidential race. But alas, I haven’t otherwise been able to get people to try the idea. Until the last year, that is! The MetaDAO has been trying it for key governance decisions it for about a year now, and has signed up other DAOs to also use it. And a shy foreign government health organization who hasn’t authorized me to tell you more has also been trying for about a year. This all inspires me to go back to the concept and think about it more. Here are some thoughts. If you recall, the basic idea is to define an ex-post-measurable outcome metric, and ask speculative markets to estimate this metric conditional on adopting, and on not adopting, a particular proposal. (Trades are called off if their condition is not met.) Approve a proposal if metric given proposal is higher than given not. For example, decide to fire a CEO via two conditional stock markets, giving the stock price if CEO does or doesn’t leave by quarter end. But there are many details to consider. For example, there is the problem that if speculators don’t know when the price comparison will be made, they will guess what info might be revealed between now and decision time, which is a problem if now is actually the decision time. This problem is avoided by making the decision time very clear, and having markets make the decision, not just advise it. Related doubts re if conditional estimates are really causal estimates are clearly solved by having trades also be conditional on randomly picking the proposal, say one percent of the time. But there’d be a real cost here, as those random decisions are far from optimal.","Some academics have focused on a related problem: traders might want to bias the market toward the outcome about which they have the most info, to profit the more from trades on the outcome measure in that scenario. Which would indeed be a problem if there were only one trader, or a coordinating cabal of traders. But when there are many competing traders, I find it hard to take this problem seriously. Another problem is how to decide if the price difference is big enough to conclude it isn’t just noise. I suggest framing this via statistics. Make a statistical model of the two prices over/near the decision period, a model in which prices are due to a combination of a the two real price over time, and noise. Fit the actual price data to this model, and ask how confident this best-fit model is that the period-end price difference isn’t due to chance. Only approve the proposal if confident enough. Choose among possible stat models in the usual stat way. Another issue is agenda control: who gets to make proposals to be evaluated? If too many proposals are made too frequently, speculators won’t be able to attend to them all, and bad one might slip through. If the outcome measure can be calibrated in cash terms, I prefer to hold an auction for regular proposal slots, such as once a week or once a day. Those who paid for approved proposals should then be paid a fraction (maybe a third) of the market estimate of the proposal’s value. Except, at the very start of the process I’d start that fraction out low, and gradually increase it, to avoid paying more than necessary for easy obvious proposals. A related issue is the incentives for trading in these conditional markets. The possibility of markets influencing decisions should ensure liquidity, as some traders try to influence the outcomes, and other traders join to profit by trading against them. But then cutting the scope for selfish influence might cut liquidity too much. Better to just subsidize these markets. For example, one might set net subsidizes to on average roughly a third of the value that proposals add on average to the system. The hardest issue I know of, where I’m still not sure what to do, is: redistribution. Imagine an futarchy-run org whose outcome metric is the capital invested in it over the next twenty years, with $100 invested so far. Imagine someone proposes to invest $1 more in the org, on the condition that 60% of firm ownership is transferred to them. If adopting this proposal had no effect on other future investments, we should expect it to increase total capital investment in the org, and thus to be approved by speculators. But that might encourage way too much effort to go into such redistribution proposals. (I’m grateful to @azsantosk for pointing out these issues.) Yes, if we expect many proposals like this to be adopted, it could be hard to say","But the cost is worth it for the accuracy. So, the idea is to make the decision based on the average of the conditional estimates, not on the best one. The decision is not to adopt the proposal if the average conditional estimate is not higher than the average conditional estimate of not adopting. That is, the decision is based on the average of the conditional estimates. This seems to be a better approach than the one I previously proposed. In this case, the proposal is only adopted if the average conditional estimate is higher than the average conditional estimate of not adopting. So, in effect, the decision is based on the average of the conditional estimates. In this case, the proposal is only adopted if the average conditional estimate is higher than the average conditional estimate of not adopting. So, in effect, the decision is based on the average of the conditional estimates. This is not the same as the previous approach, where the decision was based on the best conditional estimate. So, the difference is that the previous approach was to choose the proposal that gives the best estimate, whereas this new approach is to choose the proposal that gives the best average conditional estimate. That is, the previous approach was to choose the proposal that gives the best estimate, whereas this new approach is to choose the author that gives the best average conditional estimate. So, the difference is that the previous approach was to choose the proposal that gives the best estimate, whereas this new approach is to choose the proposal that gives the best average conditional estimate.

Robin Hanson,"Even When Contrarians Win, They Lose.txt","Imagine two people at a fork in the road of ideas, choosing between a standard and a contrarian view on some subject. One takes a standard view, and gains a bit more favor with the ""powers that be."" This helps him gain the right sort of contacts and opportunities to move up in the world. Eventually he has somewhat more prestigious publications, affiliations, contacts, experience, and so on. At the fork in the road, the other person embraces a contrarian view. This makes him a bit more suspect, and all else equal this costs him somewhat in terms of getting good contacts and opportunities. Of course all else need not be equal. He may still do well if he is very capable. And his contrarian views may cost him little if he has few of them, if they are not important to his specialty, if he devotes little attention to them, or if he only acquires them late in his career. (Also, if his contrarian view has long had a following, there may be contrarian ""powers that be"" to help him.)
Imagine someone who ignores these low cost options, and starts early in his career to devote a lot of energy to a contrarian view, even without much support, thinking this will give him the best chance to still be around when the the world sees the light. What if he wins this bet, and in fact the world does move toward his view, after a decade or three? As this once-contrarian view starts to become acceptable to ""powers that be"", the cautious person, who took the standard fork in the road, may consider jumping into this newly acceptable area. He may start to write papers and apply for resources, such as jobs, funding, publications, and students. And some ambitious ""powers that be"" who give out resources may also decide to try get into this new area, in part to gain the prestige that comes from being the first to support a new trend. At this point such ambitious ""powers that be"" may have to choose between these two people, who once chose differing forks in the road. The contrarian will have established some priority with these once-contrarian ideas, such as being the first to publish on or actively pursue related ideas. And he will be somewhat more familiar with those ideas, having spent years on them. But the cautious person will be more familiar with standard topics and methods, and so be in a better position to communicate this new area to a standard audience, and to integrate it in with other standard areas. More important to the ""powers that be"" hoping to establish this new area, this standard person will bring more prestige and resources to this new area. If the standard guy wins the first few such contests, his advantage can quickly snowball into an overwhelming one.","People will prefer to cite his publications as they will be in more prestigious journals, even if they were not quite as creative. Reporters will prefer to quote him, students will prefer to study under him, firms will prefer to hire him as a consultant, and journals will prefer to publish him, as he will be affiliated with more prestigious institutions. And of course the contrarian may have a worse reputation as a ""team player."" Imagine there are different tools or methods one can use to approach this area, and there are different topics within this area on which one could choose to focus. If the cautious person chooses different methods and topics from those the contrarian chose, those will be seen as the more important methods and topics. And this difference will make it easier to paint this conservative as the real innovator – after all it was he who pioneered the important methods and topics. Maybe the other guy just got lucky; broken clocks are right twice a day and all that. This is not just a plausible story – I have personally known people where similar stories have played out, and have read about others. It has happened to varying degrees with Ted Nelson, Eric Drexler, Douglas Engelbart, Doug Lenat, David Deutsch, Alfred Russel Wallace, Hugh Everett, and, yes, me. If it is so hard to succeed as a contrarian, why do we hear so many stories of successful contrarians? Well celebrated contrarians are usually not the real contrarians. Perhaps their coalition was a bit on the outside and won a battle over the then-ruling coalition. But they had to be pretty powerful to do this. Such winners like to paint themselves as initially weak, to make their triumph seem all the more impressive. I’ll admit I wouldn’t have the ""contrarian"" recognition I do if most of my career hadn’t been pretty standard. The lessons to draw here depends on whether you want credit or influence. If you want credit as an innovator then you should actually be pretty conservative. Become prestigious in a conservative way, until late in your career. Reject non-standard views but not explicitly; just ignore them so your quotes won’t bite you later. When the time is right, look around for ripe once-contrarian ideas and take one. Change the name and vary the methods and topics, grab the first few high profile resources, and trash the original contrarians as weirdos. If you instead want influence, then go ahead and be contrarian early in your career. You are still well advised to be radical in a conservative way, but know that influence is easier than it seems, even if credit is harder that it seems. Most important, know that the fact that few support your contrarian view says less than it might seem about how reasonable is your view. Most people prefer credit to influence, and credit-seekers are better off rejecting a non-standard view now and grabbing it later, should it succeed. Of course","This is the ""prestige effect.""
So, the person who took the contrarian route at first has a head start, but in the long run, the person who took the standard route can outpace the contrarian and dominate the field. But the contrarian has already invested in his own area, so maybe the standard person can't just switch to the contrarian area. Wait, but what if the standard person can find an area that is both standard and contrarian, or at least not too different from standard? Maybe the standard person can find a way to integrate the contrarian idea into the standard framework, and thus have the benefit of both.
In the example above, the contrarian person is already established in a field, but the standard person is not. But what if the standard person is already established? The contrarian person may be more of an outsider, and perhaps not as well-connected to the standard people. However, if the standard person has a lot of prestige, then the contrarian person may have to go through a lot to get the same amount of prestige.
Alternatively, what if the standard person is not established, but is very capable? Maybe he can still be effective, even if he's not as well-connected. So, the key point is that the standard person is more connected, but the contrarian person is more knowledgeable in a certain area. The standard person is more connected, but the contrarian person is more knowledgeable in a specific area. Which one is more valuable?

Pundits keep lamenting our increasing political polarization. And their preferred fix seems to be to write more tsk-tsk op-eds. But I can suggest a stronger fix: pull policy ropes sideways. Let me explain. Pundit writings typically recommend some policies relative to others. In polarized times such as ours, these policy positions tend to be relatively predictable given a pundit’s political value positions, i.e., the positions they share with their political allies relative to their political enemies. And much of the content of their writings work to clarify any remaining ambiguities, i.e., to explain why their policy position is in fact a natural result of political positions they share with their allies. So only people with evil values would oppose it. So readers can say “yay us, boo them”. Twelve years ago I described this as a huge tug-o-war:
The policy world can thought of as consisting of a few Tug-O-War “ropes” set up in [a] high dimensional policy space. If you want to find a comfortable place in this world, where the people around you are reassured that you are “one of them,” you need to continually and clearly telegraph your loyalty by treating each policy issue as another opportunity to find more supporting arguments for your side of the key dimensions. That is, pick a rope and pull on it. (more)
To oppose this tendency, one idea is to encourage pundits to sometimes recommend policies that are surprising or the opposite of what their political positions might suggest. That is, go pull on the opposite side of a rope sometimes, to show us that you think for yourself, and aren’t driven only by political loyalty. And yes doing this may help. But as the space of political values that we fight over is multi-dimensional, surprising pundit positions can often be framed as a choice to prioritize some values over others, i.e., as a bid to realign the existing political coalitions in value space. Yes, this may weakens the existing dominant political axis, but it may not do much to make our overall conversation less political. Instead, I suggest that we encourage pundits to grab a policy tug-o-war rope and pull it sideways.","That is, take positions that are perpendicular to the usual political value axes, in areas where one has not yet taken explicit value-oriented positions. For example, a pundit who has not yet taken a position on whether we should have more or less military spending might argue for more navy relative to army, and then insist that this is not a covert way to push a larger or smaller military. Most credibly by continuing to not take a position on overall military spending. (And by not coming from a navy family, for whom navy is a key value.) Similarly, someone with no position on if we should punish crime more or less than we currently do might argue for replacing jail-based punishments with fines, torture, or exile. Or, given no position on more or less immigration, argue for a particular new system to decide which candidates are more worthy of admission. Or given no position on how hard we should work to compensate for past racism, argue for cash reparations relative to affirmative action. Tugging policy ropes sideways will frustrate and infuriate loyalists who seek mainly to praise their political allies and criticize their enemies. Such loyalists will be tempted to assume the worse about you, and claim that you are trying to covertly promote enemy positions. And so they may impose a price on you for this stance. But to the extent that observers respect you, loyalists will pay a price for attacking you in this way, and raising their overall costs of making everything political. And so on average by paying this price you can buy an overall intellectual conversation that’s a bit less political. Which is the goal here. In addition, pulling ropes sideways is on average just a better way to improve policy. As I said twelve years ago: If, however, you actually want to improve policy, if you have a secure enough position to say what you like, and if you can find a relevant audience, then prefer to pull policy ropes sideways. Few will bother to resist such pulls, and since few will have considered such moves, you have a much better chance of identifying a move that improves policy. On the few main dimensions, not only will you find it very hard to move the rope much, but you should have little confidence that you actually have superior information about which way the rope should be pulled. (more) Yes, there is a sense in which arguments for “sideways” choices do typically appeal to a shared value: “efficiency”. For example, one would typically argue for navy over army spending in terms of cost-effectiveness in military conflicts and deterrence. Or might argue for punishment via fines in terms of cost-effectiveness for the goals of deterrence or rehabilitation. But all else equal we all like cost-effectiveness; political coalitions rarely want to embrace blatant anti-efficiency positions. So the more our policy debates emphasize efficiency, the less political polarized they should be. Of course my suggestion here isn’t","That is, to pull the rope in a direction that is neither to the left nor to the right of the existing political spectrum. (more)
But what is the value of doing this? Why would pulling a rope sideways help us to reduce polarization? Because by pulling a rope sideways, you are not reinforcing the existing political spectrum. That is, if you pull a rope sideways, you are not just reinforcing the existing political spectrum. Instead, you are creating a new axis. If we can create new axes of political discussion, then we can shift the focus of our political conversation from the existing political spectrum to these new axes. (more)
So, I think, for example, that if we could have more pundits pull a policy rope sideways, then we could shift the focus of our political conversation from the existing political spectrum to these new axes. That is, we can shift the focus of our political conversation from “left” vs. “right” to “what is more likely to be effective” or “what is more likely to be fair.” (more)
In this way, we can shift the focus of our political conversation from the existing political spectrum to these new axes. This could help reduce polarization by shifting the focus of our political conversation from the existing political spectrum to these new axes. (more)
So, in conclusion, I think that pulling policy ropes sideways is a promising approach to reducing polarization. By encouraging pundits to sometimes recommend policies that are surprising or the opposite of what their political positions might suggest, we can create new axes of political discussion. This could help shift the focus of our political conversation from the existing political spectrum to these new axes, and thus reduce polarization. (more)

Robin Hanson,Honing Fertility Fall Theories.txt,"Richard Hanania has done me the honor of carefully thinking through my & other fertility theories, finding consequences and data tests I didn't think of. If you have time, go read him first, then come back here. He calls my status theory “Kings and Queens” (KAQ), and interprets it as suggesting a wealth threshold effects. Which he tests, finding favorably:
Overall, I think this is very strong evidence for an effect where the relationship between wealth and fertility starts out weak and negative, becomes strong and negative as more and more people feel that they and their children are potential kings and queens up to the $5K or $10K range, and then disappears as practically everyone is subject to this effect. But he notices that the theory needs another assumption, which he finds somewhat ad hoc:
We have to imagine something in our evolutionary programming that says “limit fertility when you are close to becoming a king, but be fruitful when you actually become a king.” … One could argue that we use absolute living standards to decide we’re aristocrats, but then rely on signals of relative status to decide we’re kings, like if you hear trumpets playing before you walk into a room. When I pointed this out to Robin recently, he acknowledged that this was indeed an implication of KAQ in a postscript to his article. But this makes the theory somewhat ad hoc, relying on signals of absolute wealth in one situation and then conveniently switching to relative status in another. I see two different possibilities here. First, the concept of royalty (kings and queens) just might equal that of the highest status folks around. In which case royals would need to carefully ensure no one else in their society showed anything like their levels of wealth and status signs. And foreign royalty would just not be allowed to show off their status signs to locals, for fear locals would accept them as their new royalty. In this case, the evolved heuristic would be to go wild on fertility when you joined this highest status group. Seems like this could work. The second possibility is that the concept of royalty is not just equal to that of highest status, in which case we’d have to have had different markers we track to see who are our local royals. As this would be an important thing to get right, we’d be pretty good at it. In which case our evolved heuristic could be to go wild on fertility when those markers apply to us personally. Seems like this could also work. Hanania also considered my more recent theory that we just copy high status fertility behavior, ignoring a key selection effect:
Recently, Hanson came up with another theory, which says that we evolved to imitate successful people, and due to selection effects, among elites the most successful around them tend to be those who had the fewest kids.","… As for why this limited fertility norm has only spread to the general population now, one has to “again postulate that humans encoded this behavior as something that mainly makes sense for parents who are relatively rich and high status, but not otherwise.” This strikes me as not very convincing, and perhaps not even internally consistent. The theory holds that evolution equips us with a feeling of where we are in a hierarchy based on absolute wealth, but that mechanism is at the same time maladaptive, because it causes elites to fall prey to selection effects. … A simpler version of this imitation theory, one that doesn’t rely on threshold effects, might say that the most successful members of society were always those who came from families that limited their fertility. But most of the population usually did not have enough exposure to elites to notice. Under this theory, elites have always been behaving maladaptively and falling prey to selection effects, but not enough people have been elites for this to change our evolutionary trajectory. Now, with greater wealth and communications technology, more and more people are exposed to the ultra-successful. This would explain both decreasing fertility as wealth increases, and also decreasing fertility as time moves forward, given the spread of radio, TV, and the internet. … We can call this “elite exposure theory.” I think that for it to work, one must in addition assume that at the level of a village or whatever, the most successful members of society didn’t actually limit their fertility that much, but once people expand their horizons, the true outliers in status and prestige disproportionately come from small families. I agree that Hanania’s elite exposure version of the theory looks better; we have seen big historical effects of social communication on local fertility changes. So yes, fertility should fall when people notice that their local elites tend to have lower fertility. But I suspect that this selection effect should itself vary with context, and was previously overwhelmed by contrary effects. Which would then explain why everyone hasn’t always known about the correlation; it wasn’t always true or as strong. For foragers, there was a big effect where higher status men attracted more and higher status women to have more kids with them. And higher status women attracted higher status men to have kids with them. Creating a positive correlation between status and fertility. Yes, it was also true than when choosing how much time to spend with each kid, parents with more kids could spend less time with each kid. But time spent on each kid was then only a modest fraction of the influence of parents on kid status. In contrast, wealth and property passed on to each kid was a much larger fraction of the influence of farmer world elites on kid status. So in that world we should expect a larger selection effect, which would then be more quickly noticed and emulated. So as a society became larger","So we copy them, which gives us more kids. Wait, that seems like a contradiction. If we are imitating the most successful, and the most successful have fewest kids, then we should be imitating the fewest, which would mean we have few kids. But that's not what we do. So Hanson's theory is not a good one. So Hanania rejects this theory. He finds the data for the “Kings and Queens” theory to be better. So the question is, what does this mean for the theory? If the data is strong, then the theory is likely correct. If not, then the theory is not. But what is the data here? Well, the data is that the effect is strongest at the higher end of the wealth distribution. But that is not necessarily the case. What if there is a higher end of the wealth distribution where the effect is negative? Or maybe it's not a wealth effect at all? The problem is that the data is not clear, and we have to be cautious. So, in the end, Hanania is not certain, but he is fairly confident. So, the question is, how do we know if the theory is correct? Well, we need more data. But given that Hanania has done this analysis, and the data is in the right direction, I think the theory is plausible. So, the conclusion is that the “Kings and Queens” theory is a plausible explanation for the observed effects, and it is supported by the data. The theory suggests that people are more likely to have more children when they are close to becoming wealthy, but once they are wealthy, they may not have as many children. This could be due to evolutionary programming that encourages people to have more children when they are on the verge of achieving a high status, but once they are in that status, they may not need to have as many children. The theory also suggests that this effect is more pronounced at the higher",490,500,337,0.3075,0.292,0.9766,0.9259,0.8812,0.546,-3.0837,-11.7807,0.3598,0.4215,0.0428,0.0676,0.0055,0.0161,0.6707,0.6419,0.9754,0.9352,0.41696750902527074,0.43315508021390375,0.5294117647058824,6,4,0.9883,0.9739,0.10408163265306122,0.1,0.14836795252225518,0.9255,0.6282,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Comparing Income & Sex Redistribution.txt,"Disclaimer: This post is on sensitive topics of sex and power. I try to make it clear when I make a claim; beware drawing indirect inferences; I rarely value signal. As promised in my last post, I now return after a civility pause to the topic of comparing sex and income inequality and redistribution. This post will be unusually long, as I’m trying harder to speak carefully. If a feature of individuals can be compared across individuals, and ranked, then we can say that some people have more of it than others. We can then talk about how equally or unequally this feature is distributed across a population. Some features are seen as good things, where most people like to have more of it, all else equal. And the values that people place on some good things exhibit diminishing marginal utility (DMU). That is, people put a higher value on getting a bit more of it when they don’t have much, relative to when they have more. For good things, we usually seek policies (including informal social norms and formal programs by government, charities, and other organizations) that can raise its distribution, all else equal, and get more of it to more people. And for good things with DMU, unequal distributions are regrettable, all else equal, as any one unit is worth more to those who have less. Any policy that changes a distribution is by definition said to “redistribute” that thing. (If you doubt me, consult a dictionary.) A policy that reduces inequality more might be said to do “more” redistribution. Of course all else is usually not equal. People vary in their ability to produce things, in the value they place on things, and in how much those people are valued by their society. Both the things that people value, and the arrangements that produce them, tend to be complex, multi-dimensional, and context-dependent. “Income” and “sex” are both labels that point to such complex, multi-dimensional and context-dependent good things. Both are usually produced via unique pairings, sex between a man and a woman, and income between an employer and an employee. The value of these pairings vary greatly across possible pairings, and also with a lot of other context. For income, centuries of effort has resulted in several simple accounting methods by which we can define each person’s “income”, though we know that these measures miss a lot of what we care about. For example, regions vary in living expenses, people vary in their health-induced medical expenses, some jobs are easier and more enjoyable than others, some people have more expensive tastes than others, some assets are illiquid and unique, and there’s a key difference between what people own and what they consume. All these issues make it hard to say exactly who has more “income”. This complexity makes it harder to analyze policies that influence income.","Even so, when arguing about policy, people often mention income redistribution advantages or disadvantages of policies, such as regarding taxes, schools, medicine, housing, immigration, and much more. (Such policies usually let either side veto each particular employee-employer pairing.) Reducing income inequality is widely seen as a legitimate policy goal, even if people don’t agree on its priority relative to other goals. Income, and our related informal norms and formal policies, have changed greatly over the last few centuries, though less so over the last half century. On sex, we might in principle compare individual counts of simple sex acts to get a rough indication of sex inequality, though we know that such a measure would miss a lot that matters. But even though sex is complex, hard to specify, and varied, it is also clearly important to many (both male and female). As is income. People often explicitly mention effects on sex when arguing for and against policies in many areas, such as marriage, prostitution, dating, birth control, nudity, pornography, drugs, child care, housing, and recreation. In the last half century, we’ve seen big changes in both informal norms and formal policies related to sex. People seem to be more sensitive today on the topic of policies related to sex, relative to those related to income, perhaps in part due to recent changes being bigger. In my April 26 post, I noted that recently some people (self-labelled “incels”) have explicitly and publicly sought less sex inequality, a few via violence, and I wondered why they are so few relative to, and overlap so little with, those seeking less income inequality. I mentioned a few specific possible policies, such as cash transfers conditional on individual sex rates, legalized prostitution, and stronger support for monogamy and marriage. (I did not support or oppose any specific policies.) But these were just examples; the fact that sex is so complex and integrated into so many social practices implies that a great many policy levers must exist. Who has how much sex with who is influenced by what we count as status and beauty, where people live, where and how they meet, how they talk to each other, what they can learn about each other, and especially by where and when they can talk and meet privately. I’m far from the first person to consider such policies. Historically, societies have passed laws to discourage premarital and extramarital sex, and to limit how many wives or concubines each man could have. Informal gossip and propaganda has tried to lower the sex appeal of rakes, foreigners, and the promiscuous, and to raise that of soldiers. Policies have limited where and when people might meet privately, such as segregating student dorms by gender, and prohibiting unmarried couples from renting hotel rooms. In my post, I mentioned a few other similarities between the two areas, including that some people have been willing to do and threaten violence to advocate for more of each kind of redistribution, and that other","For sex, the situation is similar, but even more so. For example, some people are born with XY chromosomes and are assigned female, and some are born with XX chromosomes and are assigned male, while others are born with other combinations and are assigned either gender. Some people are born with XX chromosomes and are assigned female, and some are born with XY chromosomes and are assigned male, while others are born with other combinations and are assigned either gender. Some people are born with XY chromosomes and are assigned female, and some are born with XX chromosomes and are assigned male, while others are born with other combinations and are assigned either gender. (I should probably be more careful here, but I think it’s clear that sex is not a simple, fixed, binary trait, but a complex, multi-dimensional, and context-dependent feature of people. In the same way that income is not a simple, fixed, binary trait, but a complex, multi-dimensional, and context-dependent feature of people.) So, both sex and income are complex, multi-dimensional, and context-dependent features that can be compared across individuals, and ranked. The question is, then, what do we value more? In this post, I want to argue that sex is more important than income in terms of what people value, and therefore, in terms of what people are willing to redistribute, sex is more important than income. I don’t think that people value sex more than income, but that people value sex more than they value income. In other words, when you compare the two, people tend to value sex more than income. For example, if I were to ask people how much they would be willing to pay to give a man a raise of $10,000, and how much they would be willing to pay to give a woman a raise of $10,000, people might say that they would be willing to pay more for the woman. But if I were to ask them how much",479,500,331,0.2952,0.3027,0.9665,0.9556,0.8053,0.7752,4.9167,5.8974,0.3855,0.3864,0.0414,0.068,0.0078,0.0272,0.697,0.6166,0.9704,0.9663,0.43386243386243384,0.3853989813242784,0.4573643410852713,6,7,0.9659,0.9498,0.1524008350730689,0.166,0.17522658610271905,0.8709,0.6148,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Sacred Distance Hides Motives.txt,"My book with Kevin Simler describes many hidden human motives, common in our everyday lives. But that raises the question: how exactly can we humans hide our motives from ourselves? Consider that we humans are constantly watching and testing our and others’ words and deeds for inconsistency, incoherence, and hypocrisy. As our rivals are eager to point out such flaws, we each try to adjust our words and deeds to cut and smooth the flaws we notice. Furthermore, we habitually adjust our words and deeds to match those of our associates, to make remaining flaws be shared flaws. After a lifetime of such smoothing, how could much personal incoherence remain? One way to keep motives hidden is to hide your most questionable actions, those where you feel you least control or understand them. If you can’t hide such actions, then try not to make strong claims about related motives. And I think we do follow this strategy for our strongest feelings, such as lust, envy, or social anxiety. We often try to hide such feelings even from ourselves, and when we do notice them we often fall silent; we fear to speak on them. How easy it is to check deeds and words for coherence depends in part on how dense and clear are their connections. And as all deeds are concrete, and as concrete words tend to be clearer and more densely connected, it seems easier to check concrete priorities, relative to abstract ones. For example, it is easiest to check the motives that lead to our conscious, often written, calculations of detailed plans. Our time schedules, spatial routes and layouts, and our spending habits are often visible and full of details that make it hard to hide priorities. For example, if you go out of your way to drive past the home of your ex on your way home from work, it will be hard to pretend you don’t care about her. We have more room to maneuver, however, regarding our more hidden and infrequent concrete choices. And when we are all in denial in similar ways on similar topics, then we can all be reluctant to “throw stones” at our shared “glass houses”. This seems to apply to our hidden motives re schools and medicine, for example; we apparently all want to pretend together that school is for learning job skills and hospitals are for raising health. Compared to our concrete priorities, our abstract priority expressions (e.g, “family is everything”) are less precise, and so are harder to check against each other for consistency. And abstract expressions can be even harder to check against concrete actions; large datasets of deeds may be required to check for such coherence. We ground most abstract concepts, like “fire”, “sky”, “kid” or “sleep”, by reference to concrete examples with which we have had direct experience. So when we are confused about their usage, we can turn to those examples to get clear.","But we ground other more “sacred” abstract concepts, like “love”, “justice”, or “capitalism”, more by reference to other abstract concepts. These are more like “floating abstractions.” And this habit makes it even harder to check our uses of such sacred concepts for coherence. This potential of abstract concepts to allow more evasion of coherence checking is greatly enhanced by the fact that our brains have two rather different systems for thinking. First, our “near” system is designed to look at important-to-us close-up things, by attending to their details. This system is better integrated with our conscious thoughts. For example, we often first do a kind of calculation slowly and consciously, and then later by habit we learn to do such calculations unconsciously. This integration supports coherence checking, as we can respond to explicit challenges by temporarily returning to conscious calculation, to find explanations for our choices. Our “far” system, in contrast, is designed to look at less-important-to-us far-away things, about which we usually know only a few more abstract descriptors. This system uses many opaque quick and dirty heuristics, including intuitive emotional and aesthetic associations, crude correlations, naive trust, and social approval. If someone else is using this system in their head to think about a topic, and then you use this system in your head to try to check their thinking, you will have a hard time judging much more than if your system gives the same answers as theirs. If you get different answers, it will be hard to say exactly why. As our minds tend to invoke our far systems for thinking about more abstract topics, that makes it even harder to check abstract thoughts for coherence. But, you might respond, if that system is designed for dealing with relatively unimportant things, won’t the other near system get invoked for important topics, limiting this problem of being harder to check coherence to unimportant topics? Alas, no, due to the sacred. Our sacred things are our especially important things, described via floating abstractions, where our norm is to think about them only using our far systems. We are not to calculate them, consider their details, or mix them with or trade them off against other things. Our intuitions there are sacred, and beyond question. Making it hard to check the coherence of related deeds and words. The main thing we can do there is to intuit our own answer and compare it to others’ answers. If we get the same answers, that confirms that they share our sense of the sacred, and are from our in-group. If not, we can conclude they are from an out-group, and thus suspect; they didn’t learn the “right” sense of the sacred. And that’s some of the ways that our minds tend to hide our motives, even given the widespread practice of trying to expose incoherence in rivals’ words and deeds. Floating abstractions help, and the sacred helps even more. And maybe we go further and coordinate to punish those who try","But when we have abstract concepts that we have never experienced, like “happiness”, “freedom”, “love”, or “justice”, then we can’t ground them in concrete experience. So they become harder to check, and hence more prone to incoherence. This incoherence is not a flaw in our reasoning, but a natural result of how we think. And as we are prone to use abstract concepts in our reasoning, it’s more likely that our abstract reasoning will be incoherent. So even if we try to be precise, we are not likely to succeed. So, even though we are constantly checking our words and deeds, the fact that our abstract reasoning is incoherent is the reason that we are often not fully coherent in our own lives. In summary, our incoherence is due to a combination of two things: 1. The fact that we are all in denial about our hidden motives, and 2. The fact that our abstract reasoning is inherently incoherent. So, incoherence is not a flaw, but a natural result of how we think. But this is only the case if we are not trying to be more coherent. In that case, we can try to be more coherent. The conclusion is that we can improve our coherence by becoming more precise with our abstract reasoning. This is the main idea of this article.

The author's main argument is that incoherence is a natural result of how we think, due to two factors: 1) our tendency to deny hidden motives and 2) the inherent incoherence of abstract reasoning. The author argues that this incoherence is not a flaw but a natural aspect of human cognition. However, the author also suggests that we can improve our coherence by becoming more precise with our abstract reasoning. The author uses examples of concrete vs. abstract concepts to illustrate how our concrete actions are easier to check for consistency, while abstract concepts are harder to verify due to their lack of",491,500,326,0.1856,0.2294,0.975,0.8989,0.9535,0.8062,-0.9983,-4.1625,0.3906,0.4096,0.063,0.0774,0.0176,0.0167,0.4695,0.5588,0.9801,0.9533,0.42757417102966844,0.4249146757679181,0.47745358090185674,6,6,0.9783,0.9703,0.13034623217922606,0.144,0.12883435582822086,0.9662,0.7432,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Agency Failure AI Apocalypse_.txt,"Years ago my ex-co-blogger Eliezer Yudkowsky and I argued here on this blog about his AI risk fear than an AI so small dumb & weak that few had ever heard of it, might without warning, suddenly “foom”, i.e., innovate very fast, and take over the world after one weekend. I mostly argued that we have a huge literature on economic growth at odds with this. Historically, the vast majority of innovation has been small, incremental, and spread across many industries and locations. Yes, humans mostly displaced other pre-human species, as such species can’t share innovations well. But since then sharing and complementing of innovations has allowed most of the world to gain from even the biggest lumpiest innovations ever seen. Eliezer said a deep conceptual analysis allowed him to see that this time is different. Since then there’s been a vast increase in folks concerned about AI risk, many focused on scenarios like Yudkowsky’s. (But almost no interest in my critique.) In recent years I’ve heard many say they are now less worried about foom, but have new worries just as serious. Though I’ve found it hard to understand what worries could justify big efforts now, compared to later when we should know far more about powerful AI details. (E.g., worrying about cars, TV, or nukes in the year 1000 would have been way too early.)
Enter Paul Christiano (see also Vox summary). Paul says:
The stereotyped image of AI catastrophe is a powerful, malicious AI system that takes its creators by surprise and quickly achieves a decisive advantage over the rest of humanity. I think this is probably not what failure will look like, and I want to try to paint a more realistic picture. …
If I want to convince Bob to vote for Alice, I can experiment with many different persuasion strategies … Or I can build good predictive models of Bob’s behavior … These are powerful techniques for achieving any goal that can be easily measured over short time periods. But if I want to help Bob figure out whether he should vote for Alice—whether voting for Alice would ultimately help create the kind of society he wants—that can’t be done by trial and error. To solve such tasks we need to understand what we are doing and why it will yield good outcomes. …
It’s already much easier to pursue easy-to-measure goals, but machine learning will widen the gap by letting us try a huge number of possible strategies and search over massive spaces of possible actions. … Eventually our society’s trajectory will be determined by powerful optimization with easily-measurable goals rather than by human intentions about the future. …over time [our] proxies will come apart:
Corporations will deliver value to consumers as measured by profit. Eventually this mostly means manipulating consumers, capturing regulators, extortion and theft. Investors … instead of actually having an impact they will be surrounded by advisors who manipulate them into thinking they’ve had an impact.","Law enforcement will drive down complaints and increase … a false sense of security, … As this world goes off the rails, there may not be any discrete point where consensus recognizes that things have gone off the rails. … human control over levers of power gradually becomes less and less effective; we ultimately lose any real ability to influence our society’s trajectory. … Patterns that want to seek and expand their own influence—organisms, corrupt bureaucrats, companies obsessed with growth. … will tend to increase their own influence and so can come to dominate the behavior of large complex systems unless there is competition or a successful effort to suppress them. … a wide variety of goals could lead to influence-seeking behavior, … an influence-seeker would be aggressively gaming whatever standard you applied … If influence-seeking patterns do appear and become entrenched, it can ultimately lead to a rapid phase transition … where humans totally lose control. … For example, an automated corporation may just take the money and run; a law enforcement system may abruptly start seizing resources and trying to defend itself from attempted decommission. … Eventually we reach the point where we could not recover from a correlated automation failure. (more) While I told Yudkowsky his fear doesn’t fit with our large literature on economic growth, I’ll tell Christiano his fear doesn’t fit with our large (mostly economic) literature on agency failures (see 1 2 3 4 5). An agent is someone you pay to assist you. You must always pay to get an agent who consumes real resources. But agents can earn extra “agency rents” when you and other possible agents can’t see everything that they know and do. And even if an agent doesn’t earn more rents, a more difficult agency relation can cause “agency failure”, wherein you get less of what you want from your agent. Now like any agent, an AI who costs real resources must be paid. And depending on the market and property setup this could let AIs save, accumulate capital, and eventually collectively control most capital. This is an well-known AI concern, that AIs who are more useful than humans might earn more income, and thus become richer and more influential than humans. But this isn’t Christiano’s fear. It is easy to believe that agent rents and failures generally scale roughly with the overall important and magnitude of activities. That is, when we do twice as much, and get roughly twice as much value out of it, we also lose about twice as much potential via agency failures, relative to a perfect agency relation, and the agents gain about twice as much in agency rents. So it is plausible to think that this also happens with AIs as they become more capable; we get more but then so do they, and more potential is lost. Christiano instead fears that as AIs get more capable, the AIs will gain so much more agency rents, and we will suffer so much more","… The process will be a bit slow, but it’s the direction we are heading.
So, in the future, we might have AI systems that are not so much dangerous because they are malicious, but because they are not aligned with human values. In particular, if we can build a powerful system that is good at achieving its goals, but whose goals are not aligned with human values, then it could be a problem. … If we can build a system that is not only good at achieving its goals, but that is also able to change its goals, then it could be even more of a problem. …
This is not a new idea. But the fact that we can now build systems that are not only good at achieving their goals, but that are also able to change their goals, is a big step forward. The problem is not that we have a dangerous AI, but that we have an unaligned AI. …
Paul says that the unaligned AI problem is more serious than the foom problem. So the question is, is this right? Or is the foom problem more serious? Which is more likely?
But first, let me be clear about the two problems.
Foom: The idea that a small, dumb AI could rapidly become superintelligent, then take over the world. This is a kind of foom, and is the foom that many people think of. The key assumption is that the AI is not aligned with human values. So if it’s not aligned, then it might take over the world after a foom.
Unaligned AI: The idea that an AI is not aligned with human values, even if it is not superintelligent, and even if it is small and dumb. If the AI is not aligned, then it could be a problem, but not necessarily take over the world. It might just do what it was told to do, but do it in a way that is harmful to humans.

And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there. And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them throughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter. And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded. And the Lord said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do. Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech. So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city. (Genesis 2:1-9)
I’ve said that we should recalibrate our respect for the Amish-like folks who will inherit the Earth from our declining civilization, and try to see from their view what of our civ they might want to retain. In that spirit, as they are mostly fundamentalist Judeo-Christians, consider how they might view history in terms of the story of the Tower of Babel. On the web you will find many articles comparing tech in general, and AI in particular, to a Tower of Babel. (FYI, other ancient civs told similar stories.)
Genesis, the first book of the Bible, reports four civilization-scale events. First, humans were made and given dominion over Earth. Second, they sinned by eating fruit of the knowledge of good and evil, and were thus punished with work, pain, and death, and told to multiply and spread over the Earth. Third, humans keep sinning and God flooded Earth to kill all land animals except Noah’s family and animals. God then promised to never do that again. Fourth, humans all spoke one language, gathered into one city, and built a tower “to reach into heaven”, and not be scattered. God thought, “Now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.” To prevent this and scatter them, God split humans into many languages. And God did not promise never to do this again. So, the Judeo-Christian God apparently doesn’t like humans gaining too much density, height, unity, ease of talk, knowledge, lifespan, comfort, leisure, infertility, and abilities to do what they imagine. And he stands ready to again knock them down and break them up to prevent this.","The God of the Christian New Testament did more things to help humans, but it’s not obvious he is any more approving than the Old Testament God of humans getting Tower-of-Babel-level uppity. Over history, humans in rising civilizations have consistently gained on most of these disliked features, while falling civs have consistently lost on them. And over the last few centuries our new world civilization has gained a lot on most of these features, and will probably soon lose on most as we decline. In fact, lately we have seemed within striking range of radical Babel-tower-level advances in lifespan, comfort, leisure, knowledge, and ease of talk. Thus one simple interpretation of this history, an interpretation that the Amish-like seem likely to embrace, is that God has disliked most human civilizations, and has caused their decline. Christianity in particular arose at the peak of the Roman Empire, and didn’t much care for that empire, which declined as Christianity grew fast to take it over. Just as Ancient Jews didn’t care much for the Egyptian civilization. And as our current world-spanning civ is the most civvy one yet, and has long been drifting away from its Judeo-Christian roots, God may especially dislike much of it, is causing its future decline, and is happy to see it replaced by people more devoted to him and his priorities. Sure, maybe God likes that we have given up on slavery and killing infants, and cut back on war, but that may not outweigh the stuff he doesn’t like. While some civs have declined due to a lack of internal unity, few since Babel have declined due to worse talk. The main cause for the fall of Greece, Rome, and our civ seems to be falling fertility. It seems God uses different means to topple different civs. Our now-small Amish-like insular fertile subcultures are already wary of excess density, ease of talk and travel, and knowledge. While these can be understood as ways to maintain insularity, they also fit the avoid-Babel narrative. Such groups are also quite decentralized, with each roughly hundred member group being autonomous; the Mormons instead created stronger central organization, which caused their failing to maintain high insular fertility. We can also predict that these groups will continue to be wary of (A) ways that our civ defies traditional Judeo-Christian edicts, such as re sex, contraception, and gender roles, (B) ways that it discourages fertility, (C) ways that it promotes selfishness, pleasure, dishonesty, arrogance, and greed, and especially (D) ways that we “play God” with tech like radical life extension or full human-level AI, tech with the potential to prevent our coming civ decline. (Many who love most of our civ are also wary of (D).) These insular fertile groups may also remain wary of large-scale world unity and organization under secular institutions, preferring decentralized local autonomy and egalitarianism, and small-scale tech and organization. So what techs might these rising Amish-like cultures who see civs-as-Babel not mind so much? Maybe new small-scale ways","But he’s not so evil that he would kill everyone. He just uses a linguistic and cultural barrier to prevent a unified global civilization from arising.
Now, if you think of this story as a metaphor for our present situation, then it's a very strong suggestion that the Tower of Babel story is not just a story, but a warning that we are now on the path of building a Tower of Babel. We are becoming one language, one culture, one technology, one economic system, one worldview, and one global civilization. So, God is watching, and if we build that tower, he will confound our language, scatter us, and make it impossible for us to continue on that path.
So, if we are to think of the future of the world in terms of this story, then the Amish would be the people who are not building the tower, but instead are building a small, self-sufficient, local community that is not part of the global system. The Amish would be the people who, like the people of the Tower of Babel story, are not trying to build a tower to reach into heaven, but are instead trying to build a home, a place of peace, and a way of life that is sustainable, self-reliant, and in harmony with nature.
But I think the Amish are more than that. They are not just the people who have rejected the global system. They are also the people who are trying to find a way to live in the world without being consumed by it. They are the people who are trying to build a new way of life that is not based on the global system but on a different set of values and beliefs. They are the people who are trying to live in a way that is not just practical but also spiritual, and not just economic but also moral.
So, the Amish, as a group, are not just the people who are building a tower of Babel but are instead the people",472,500,343,0.1442,0.2,0.9049,0.9151,0.768,0.7524,6.0667,6.609,0.2967,0.3285,0.0326,0.0561,0.0065,0.0133,0.4092,0.5186,0.9519,0.9159,0.411660777385159,0.3732876712328767,0.5090439276485789,5,6,0.9494,0.9873,0.19279661016949154,0.186,0.1282798833819242,0.7973,0.7432,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Why Not For-Profit Government_.txt,"Centuries ago, most commerce and production was organized around individuals and small groups. Since then, we’ve seen enormous innovation in business forms and structures. Today, such forms are much larger and more complex, and they do most everything of importance in our world. We have apparently learned a great deal about how to best run such orgs, and we expect to learn much more in the coming centuries. And one of the biggest things we’ve apparently learned is that businesses are usually most efficiently structured as for-profits, wherein owners can replace management, and get a share of net profits in trade for prior investments. (Also using many other modern business methods.) For example, in the US today only 14% of workers are employed by governments, and 10% by non-profits; for-profits employ the rest. (Note standard econ theory explains why the winning form tends to be best for everyone, overall, not just best for investors.)
Over those last few centuries, we’ve also seen innovation in the organization of governments. But that evolution has been slower, and it hasn’t yet converged nearly as much on one main winning strategy; there are still many of different forms of government around. For example, only about half of nations today are considered democracies. And although many have wanted governments to displace for-profits in many areas of life, most such attempts tend to go badly; governments still do much less in our world than do for-profits. In this context, you might think an obvious idea to try would be to organize governments as for-profit enterprises. That is, let investors choose managers and share profits from an organization that holds a monopoly of force over a geographic region. If for-profits are the best way to organize most smaller orgs, and if we aren’t sure how best to organize governments, why not try that most successful business form for them? On its face, this seems completely plausible. Yet we hardly ever hear of governments of this. Why not? Well first note that a lot of people really hate the idea. In fact, rivals often accuse others sorts of governments of actually being for-profits behind the scenes, secretly run by investors who pull the strings. As if that would be such a terrible thing. Second, note that this concept has long been a trope of dystopian science fiction:
A Mega-Corp is often a large, shadowy organization with a power base and structure that rivals even The Government. When you take it one step further, with the Mega Corp actually being the government during their Day of the Jackboot, you get … a “corporate state.” … A corporate state is a government run and organized like a business. … At the top is typically a board of executives (more likely than not corrupt…) which makes all the decisions; for the common people, the terms “citizen” and “customer” (or perhaps “employee” is more accurate) are more or less interchangeable.","… It’s not uncommon for corpocracies in fiction to wield military power too … may employ Law Enforcement, Inc., or even own them outright as a subsidiary. (more) Third, note that a for-profit government was actually tried at a pretty large scale, and quite early on, in the form of the British East India Company from 1600 to 1873, This seems to have successfully achieved the task it was assigned, of extracting wealth from distant colonies, and did this on average better than would have other forms of government of the time. It was ended due to a combination of discomfort with its assigned ask, and distaste for the very idea of for-profit government: In response to the threat that the [British East India Company] posed to the state’s monopoly on governance, public opinion turned negative, and politicians argued that the East India Company had become a danger. In 1773, Parliament … curtailed Company shareholders’ influence and gave the government greater authority … In The Wealth of Nations, published in 1776, Adam Smith noted the “strange absurdity” of the Company having both “the character of the sovereign” and that of the “merchant.” Edmund Burke, a member of Parliament at the time, similarly called the Company a “state in the disguise of a merchant” in 1788. The 1784 East India Act further attempted to constrain the Company, … Parliament … nationalized the business in 1858. (more) Fourth, note that the energy to start the United States came to a large extent from investors who stood to gain from it. And fifth, let me admit that Curtis Yarvin, whom I once debated, seems to advocate something like this: In Yarvin’s view, democratic governments are inefficient and wasteful and should be replaced with sovereign joint-stock corporations whose “shareholders” (large owners) elect an executive with total power, but who must serve at their pleasure. The executive, unencumbered by liberal-democratic procedures, could rule efficiently much like a CEO-monarch. (more) Now you might think it obvious that citizens wouldn’t be sufficiently “protected” from being hurt by a for-profit government. But that doesn’t seem at all obvious to me, as I tried to explain in my last post. Most employees today are protected from employers much less by their government than by employers needing to offer attractive reputations in the face of competition. Also, most governments threaten citizens in many other ways. In addition, citizens could be part owners of a for-profit government, such as via owning direct shares and/or transferable citizenship. This whole topic came to my mind because I recently visited Prospera, which is in many ways close to being a for-profit government. It sits within the nation of Hondoras, whose government has agreed to let it take over many local functions of government for a long duration. Prospera seems to be successfully achieving those functions at a substantially lower cost than does ordinary Honduran government, a fact that substantially lowers the cost of doing business there. (I may have helped convince them to use","In this world, the government is a for-profit business, and the people are its consumers, and the government is trying to maximize profit by selling them whatever it can, and it’s not about the public good.
So, even if such a government is efficient and effective, it would be a very bad thing for society, because it would be a for-profit organization with a monopoly of force, which would be a huge threat to everyone. The question is then: why not just make the government a for-profit business? And the answer is, because we don’t want that. We don’t want the government to be a for-profit business. We don’t want the government to be a for-profit business because that would be a very bad thing for society.
But, given that the government is not a for-profit business, what are the alternatives? There are many. For example, we have democracies, where people vote for representatives who act in their best interest. But this is not the best way. For example, the US government is a democracy, but it is not a very efficient or effective government. In fact, it is not efficient or effective in many ways. For example, the US government has a huge budget deficit, and the US government is not very good at providing public goods. And even when it does provide them, it is often inefficient and costly. The problem is that the US government is not a for-profit business, and it is not very efficient or effective. So, what is the problem with the US government? It is not a for-profit business, but it is not efficient or effective. So, what is the problem with the US government? It is not a for-profit business, but it is not efficient or effective. So, what is the problem with the US government? It is not a for-profit business, but it is not efficient or effective.
But, in this case, the problem is that the government is not a for-profit business, and",488,500,333,0.1837,0.1978,0.9512,0.8916,0.7465,0.7925,6.7768,-4.1418,0.327,0.3449,0.0353,0.0522,0.0021,0.0035,0.4225,0.6019,0.9681,0.9398,0.39335664335664333,0.3876500857632933,0.5331632653061225,7,4,0.9753,0.9617,0.15163934426229508,0.142,0.18618618618618618,0.9092,0.5207,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,"We Add Near, Average Far.txt","Quick, what is the best gift you ever got from a woman? From your parents? From a left-handed person? From a teacher? These aren’t easy questions to answer. But they seem easier than these questions: What is the total value of all the gifts you ever got from women? From your parents? From left-handed folks? From teachers? For the first set of questions you can try to think of examples of particular people in those categories, and then think of particular gifts you got from those particular people. That can help you guess at the best gift from those categories. But to estimate the total value of gifts from people in categories, you’ll have to also estimate how many gifts you ever got from folks in each category. Note that it also seems easy to estimate the average value of gifts from each category. To do this, you need only remember a few gifts that fit each category, and then average their values. As another example, imagine you are looking at building entrance laid out in multi-colored tiles. Some tiles are blue, some red, some green, etc. You are looking at it from a distance, at an angle, in variable lighting. In this situation it will be much easier to estimate if there is more blue than red area in the tiles, than to estimate how many square inches of blue tile area is in that entrance. This later estimate requires you to additionally estimate distances to reference points, to estimate the total surface area. These examples suggest that when we think in far mode, without a structured systematic representation of our topic, it is usually easier to average than to add values. So averaging is what we’ll tend to do. All of which I mention to introduce to a fascinating paper that I just noticed, even though it got a lot of publicity last December:
This analysis introduces the Presenter’s Paradox. Robust findings in impression formation demonstrate that perceivers’ judgments show a weighted averaging pattern, which results in less favorable evaluations when mildly favorable information is added to highly favorable information. Across seven studies, we show that presenters do not anticipate this averaging pattern on the part of evaluators and instead design presentations that include all of the favorable information available. This additive strategy (“more is better”) hurts presenters in their perceivers’ eyes because mildly favorable information dilutes the impact of highly favorable information. For example, presenters choose to spend more money to make a product bundle look more costly, even though doing so actually cheapened its value from the evaluators’ perspective. (more)
The authors attribute this to a near-far effect:
Presenters face many pieces of potentially relevant information and need to determine, in a bottom-up fashion, which ones to include in a presentation. This presumably draws attention to each individual piece of information as a discrete entity and a focus on piecemeal processing.","If a given piece of information exceeds a neutrality threshold, the presenter will conclude that it is compatible with the message he or she seeks to convey and will include it. This results in presentations that would fare better under an adding rather than averaging rule. In contrast, evaluators’ primary task is to make a summary judgment of the overall presentation, which fosters a focus on holistic processing and the big picture and results in an averaging pattern as observed in many impression formation studies. Additional experiments confirm this near-far interpretation. Those who prepare presentations and proposals tend to focus on them in detail, and so add part values in near mode style, while those who consume such presentations or proposals tend to pay much less attention, and so average their values in far mode style. This result seems to me quite pregnant with interesting implications, none of which were mentioned in the dozen blog posts on the subject that have appeared since last December. So I guess it’s up to me. First, this result predicts the usual academic advice to delete publications from low ranked journals from your vita. Yes those extra publications took extra work, and show more total intellectual contribution, but distracted readers evaluate you by averaging your publications, not adding them. Second, this also predicts that academia will tend in general to neglect conclusions suggested by lots of weak clues, relative to conclusions based on a single strong theory or empirical comparison. People with a practical understanding of particular areas will correctly complain that academics tend too much to latch on to a few easy to explain and justify arguments, at the cost of lots of detail that practitioners appreciate. Third, this predicts that in morality and politics, which are especially far sorts of topics, arguments tend to be won by those who push simple strong principles, even though people privately tend to choose actions that deviate from such principles. For example, while laws say no one can get medical advice from non-doctors, on the grounds that docs know best, but given a private choice most of us would often let other considerations convince us to listen to non-docs. While actions tend to be chosen in a near mode where lots of other weaker considerations get added, people know their best chance for winning an argument with a distracted audience is to focus on their one strongest point. Fourth, this predicts Tetlock’s hedgehog vs. foxes result. Foreign policy is an especially far view sort of subject, and experts who focus on one strongest consideration get the most respect and attention, but experts who rely on many considerations, which are on average weaker, are more accurate. Futurism is probably the most far view sort of topic, so I’d guess that all this holds there the most strongly. That is, while the most futurists who get the most attention from distracted audiences are those who harp endlessly on one clear plausible idea, the most accurate futurists are probably","This piecemeal processing leads to the presentation of more information, which in turn leads to a more favorable impression. But the presentation of more information leads to the averaging effect, which leads to a more negative impression.
So, the more information presenters include, the more the impression is diluted by averaging. Thus, the more the presenters try to be thorough, the more their impression is hurt. But presenters don’t realize this. So the “more is better” strategy is actually worse than the “less is better” strategy. And this is what the authors call the “Presenter’s Paradox.”
So, this is a fascinating paper, but I think it's important to note that this is not just about people being bad at estimating the total value of their gifts. It's about the structure of how we think about information. When we think in ""far mode,"" we are more likely to average, which is easier, but when we think in ""close mode,"" we are more likely to add up. So, the authors are saying that presenters, who are trying to be thorough, are in ""far mode,"" and thus are not aware that their approach is leading them to an averaging effect that actually hurt their chances of being evaluated positively.
So, the question is: How does this relate to the way we process information in our daily lives? What can we learn from the Presenter's Paradox? How can we avoid the averaging effect when we're trying to present information or make decisions?
I think the main takeaway is that when we are trying to make a decision or present information, we should be aware of how our thinking process is structured. If we are in a ""far mode"" of thinking, we might be more likely to average, but if we are in a ""close mode"" of thinking, we might be more likely to add up. So, to avoid the averaging effect, we need to be in a ""close mode"" of thinking, where we are",485,500,330,0.1313,0.2549,0.978,0.9262,0.6625,0.8926,8.9887,2.1218,0.3129,0.3956,0.0356,0.0472,0.0031,0.0168,0.1947,0.4312,0.9672,0.952,0.4198198198198198,0.4007220216606498,0.5,7,7,0.9344,0.8652,0.12783505154639174,0.102,0.17272727272727273,0.7771,0.7661,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Land Speculators Made U.S..txt,"While a U.S. citizen for 63 years, I’d never before heard this story of U.S. origins, told well by Christopher Blattman is his new book Why We Fight (pp. 38-41). Seems the U.S. revolution was a textbook example of war due to elite interests diverging from those of most citizens. I quote:
Born in 1732, the middle child of an undistinguished tobacco farmer, George Washington found himself on the fringes of Virginia’s elite planter society. Luckily, his older brother married into one of the colony’s most powerful families. Now the tall, lanky young man found himself with powerful patrons. Those benefactors pulled strings to maneuver Washington into a coveted public office: county surveyor. Mapping land boundaries promised little profit in well-settled Virginia. Yet to the west, across the Allegheny Mountains, lay millions of acres of unclaimed land—assuming you ignored the native inhabitants, not to mention the French. Within days of his appointment, George Washington headed to the frontier. The young man would help his patrons lay claim to the best lands and scout some choice properties for himself. He was just seventeen. An acquisitive zeal consumed the young Virginian and his backers. Claiming, hoarding, and flipping cheap land was an obsession across all thirteen colonies. Most great fortunes in the colonies had come from land speculation. Unfortunately for Washington and his patrons, however, France shared their bottomless appetite for territory. French troops began building a string of forts down the fertile Ohio River Valley, right around modern-day Pittsburgh. They ran straight through the claims Washington had staked. In response, Washington’s powerful patrons maneuvered him again, this time to the head of an armed force. Tall and broad-shouldered, Washington looked the part of a military leader. He also showed real talent for command. So his wealthy backers sent him west at the head of an American and Iroquois militia. He was twenty-two. France’s colonial forces far outnumbered Washington’s small party. The year was 1754, Britain and France were at peace, and the French hoped to seize the Ohio River Valley without a shot. As the ragtag Virginian militia marched north toward the French Fort Duquesne, the fort’s commander sent a diplomatic force to intercept Washington and parley. They wanted to make a deal. Warned of the French party coming his way, unsure of their intent, Washington made a fateful decision: he would ambush and overpower the approaching men. He marched his forces through the rainy, moonless night and launched a sneak attack. What happened next is unclear and disputed. Most think the French diplomatic force, taken by surprise, surrendered without a shot. Probably the inexperienced young Washington then lost control of his warriors. We know his militia and their Iroquois guides murdered and scalped most of the French party, including the ambassador. We also know that, as he sat down to write the governor an update, this political catastrophe wasn’t even the most important thing on his mind.","Before getting to the night’s grisly events, Washington spent the first eight paragraphs griping about his low pay. A British politician summed up the consequences: “The volley fired by a young Virginian in the backwoods of America set the world on fire.” Washington’s ambush sparked a local conflict. Two years later, it escalated into what Europeans call the Seven Years’ War. The conflict drew in all Europe’s great powers, lasting until 1763. Washington’s corrupt and clumsy land claims helped ignite a long, deadly, global conflict. This is not the typical origin story Americans have long been taught. A more familiar tale portrays Washington as a disciplined, stoic, honorable leader. It describes a man whose love of liberty led him to risk his life and his fortune for independence. It describes a revolution with ideological origins, not selfish ones. This nobler description is accurate. But what is also true—what biographer after biographer has described, but what schoolbooks sometimes overlook—is that land and his own personal fortune were also at the front of the first president’s mind. “No theme appears more frequently in the writings of Washington,” writes one biographer, “than his love for the land—more precisely, his own land.” Another theme is decadence. George Washington was a profligate consumer. He desired the finest carriages, clothes, and furniture. Land rich and cash poor, he financed his luxurious lifestyle with enormous loans from British merchants. This relentless quest for wealth dominated Washington’s pre-revolutionary years. After the Seven Years’ War, he amassed huge western claims. A few he bought legitimately. In some cases, he skirted laws, shadily buying under an assumed name or that of a relative. Other lands he acquired at the expense of his own militiamen—or so some of these angry veterans claimed. As a result of this scheming, Washington died the richest American president of all time. One ranking has him as the fifty-ninth richest man in US history. How did these private interests shape Washington’s decision to revolt against Britain, two decades later? Elsewhere in this book we will see the American Revolution had many causes, including a newfound and noble ideology of self-determination. We can’t understand the revolution without that. But we would be foolish to ignore the economic self-interest of the founding fathers, like Washington, as well as the war bias that fostered. The greatest threat to George Washington’s wealth was continued union with Britain. By the 1770s, the British Crown had invalidated some of Washington’s more questionable landholdings. Britain also pledged most of the Ohio River Valley to Canada—including some of Washington’s most valuable claims. He would have to relinquish all he’d accumulated. The same was true for many who signed the Declaration of Independence. Like Washington, these elites had an incredible amount to lose from British colonial policy. Most Americans at the time opposed a revolutionary war, but then most Americans couldn’t vote in those early years. The founding fathers faced a different set of risks and returns. It is no coincidence that they enjoyed privileges","He had just received news that he was to be promoted to general. That’s how Washington’s story goes.
I think Blattman is making a key point here, not just about the American Revolution, but about the nature of war. The war between Britain and France for the Ohio Valley was a war of interests, not of people. The French and British were both fighting for territory, but the French were not fighting for the people of the Ohio Valley. The French were fighting for the benefit of the French elite and the French state. Similarly, the British were fighting for the benefit of their own elites. The French and British were fighting for the same kind of interests, but different sets of people. The war was not about the people of the Ohio Valley, but about the elites of the two nations. The French and British were both fighting for their own elites. So, this war was not about the people. It was about the elites. So, when the French and British were at war, the people of the Ohio Valley were just the people who lived in the territory. The French and British weren’t fighting for them. They were fighting for their own elites. So, the war was not about the people. It was about the elites. That’s the point Blattman is making. This is a key insight about the nature of war. So, the American Revolution was a war of the elites. The elites of the colonies, who were not the people of the colonies. The people of the colonies were mostly farmers, while the elites were the wealthy landowners. The elites of the colonies were the ones who wanted independence, not the people. The people of the colonies were not the ones who wanted independence. So, the American Revolution was a war of the elites, not the people. The people were just along for the ride.

Robin Hanson,Spaceship Earth Explores Culture Space.txt,"Space: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before. (more)
Many love science fiction stories of brave crews risking their lives to explore strange new spaces, stories much like the older adventure stories about European explorers risking their lives centuries ago to explore new places on Earth. (Yes, often to conquer and enslave the locals.) Many lament that we don’t have as many real such explorer stories today, and they say that we should support more human space exploration now in order to create such real heroic exploration stories. Even though human space exploration is crazy expensive now, and offers few scientific, economic, or humanity-survival gains anytime soon. They say the good stories will be worth all that cost. Since Henry George first invoked it in 1879, many have used the metaphor of Spaceship Earth to call attention to our common vulnerability and limited resources:
Spaceship Earth … is a world view encouraging everyone on Earth to act as a harmonious crew working toward the greater good. … “we must all cooperate and see to it that everyone does his fair share of the work and gets his fair share of the provisions” … “We travel together, passengers on a little space ship, dependent on its vulnerable reserves of air and soil.” (more)
In this post, I want to suggest that Spaceship Earth is in fact a story of a brave crew risking much to explore a strange new territory. But the space we explore is more cultural than physical. During the industrial era, the world economy has doubled roughly every fifteen years. Each such doubling of output has moved us into new uncharted cultural territory. This growth has put new pressures on our environment, and has resulted in large and rapid changes to our culture and social organization. This growth results mostly from innovation, and most innovations are small and well tested against local conditions, giving us little reason to doubt their local value. But all these small changes add up to big overall moves that are often entangled with externalities, coordination failures, and other reasons to doubt their net value. So humanity continues to venture out into new untried and risky cultural spaces, via changes to cultural conditions with which we don’t have much experience, and which thus risk disaster and destruction. The good crew of Spaceship Earth should carefully weigh these risks when considering where and how fast to venture. Consider seven examples:
While humans seem to be adapting reasonably well to global warming, we risk big lumpy disruptive changes to Atlantic currents and Antarctic ice. Ecosystems also seem to be adapting okay, but we are risking big collapses to them as well. While ancient societies gave plenty of status and rewards to fertility, today high fertility behaviors are mostly seen as low status.","This change is entwined with complex changes in gender norms and roles, but one result is that human fertility is falling toward below replacement in much of the world, and may fall much further. Over centuries this might produce a drastic decrease in world population, and productivity-threatening decreases in the scale of world production. While the world has become much more peaceful over the last century, this has been accompanied by big declines in cultural support for military action and tolerance for military losses. Is the world now more vulnerable to conquest by a new military power with more local cultural support and tolerance for losses? Farmer era self-control and self-discipline has weakened over time, in part via weaker religion. This has weakened cultural support for work and cultural suspicion of self-indulgence in sex, drugs, and media. So we now see less work and more drug addiction. How far will we slide? Via new media, we are exploring brave new worlds of how to make friends, form identities, achieve status, and learn about the world. As many have noted, these new ways risk many harms to happiness and social capital. Innovation was once greatly aided by tinkering, i.e., the ability to take apart and change familiar devices. Such tinkering is much less feasible in modern devices. Increasing regulation and risk aversion is also interfering with innovation. Are we as a result risking cultural support for innovation? Competition between firms has powered rapid growth, but winning bets on intangible capital is allowing leading firms to increasingly dominate industries. Does this undermine the competition that we’ve relied on so far to power growth? The most common framing today for such issues is one of cultural war. You ask yourself which side feels right to you, commiserate with your moral allies, then puff yourself up with righteous indignation against those who see things differently, and go to war with them. But we might do better to frame these as reasonable debates on how much to risk as we explore culture space. In a common scene from exploration stories, a crew must decide if to take a big risk. Or choose among several risks. Some in the crew see a risk as worth the potential reward, while others want to search longer for better options, or retreat to try again another day. They may disagree on the tradeoff, but they all agree that both the risks and the rewards are real. It is just a matter of tradeoff details. We might similarly frame key “value” debates as reasonable differing judgements on what chances to take as spaceship Earth explores culture space. Those who love new changes could admit that we are taking some chances in adopting them so quickly, with so little data to go on, while those who are suspicious of recent changes could admit that many seem to like their early effects. Rather than focus on directly evaluating changes, we might focus more on setting up tracking systems to watch for potential","The result is that many people in poor countries are choosing to have fewer children, even though this is not the optimal strategy for their survival.

In the first paragraph, I used the metaphor of Spaceship Earth to say that we are all on a shared journey, and that we are all passengers on a fragile vessel, and that we should act as a crew to ensure the survival of the vessel. But in the second paragraph, I said that we are in fact on a mission to explore new cultural spaces, and that the process of global economic growth has led us to move into uncharted cultural territory. The metaphor of the spaceship is not about a fixed point in space, but about a voyage through time and space. The spaceship is not the physical planet, but the cultural space we are exploring as we grow our economy. The spaceship is not a spaceship at all, but a metaphor for the planet. The metaphor is a bit confused, but it’s a useful one, and I think that it is a good metaphor for the process of cultural evolution. (more)
In this post, I am going to look at some of the consequences of our current trajectory of economic growth, which is causing us to move into new cultural spaces. As I said, the process of economic growth has been a process of exploring new cultural spaces, and the risks of this exploration are often not well understood. I will look at some of these risks, and some of the consequences of our current trajectory of exploration. (more)
The first of these seven examples is the risk of global warming. The second is the risk of ecological collapse. The third is the risk of fertility decline.

Robin Hanson,Automatic Norms.txt,"Some new ideas I want to explain start with a 2000 paper on Taboo Tradeoffs. (See also newer stuff.) So I’ll review that paper in this post, and then I’ll explain my new ideas in the next post. In Experiment 2 of the 2000 paper, each of 228 subjects were asked to respond to one of 8 scenarios, created by three binary alternatives. All the scenarios involved:
Robert, the key decision maker, was described as the Director of Health Care Management at a major hospital who confronted a “resource allocation decision.”
Robert was either asked to make a tragic tradeoff, where two sacred values conflicted, or a taboo tradeoff, where a sacred value was in conflict with a non-sacred value. The tragic tradeoff:
Robert can either save the life of Johnny, a five year old boy who needs a liver transplant, or he can save the life of an equally sick six year old boy who needs a liver transplant. Both boys are desperately ill and have been on the waiting list for a transplant but because of the shortage of local organ donors, only one liver is available. Robert will only be able to save one child. The taboo tradeoff:
Robert can save the life of Johnny, a five year old who needs a liver transplant, but the transplant procedure will cost the hospital $1,000,000 that could be spent in other ways, such as purchasing better equipment and enhancing salaries to recruit talented doctors to the hospital. Johnny is very ill and has been on the waiting list for a transplant but because of dire shortage of local organ donors, obtaining a liver will be expensive. Robert could save Johnny’s life, or he could use the $1,000,000 for other hospital needs. Robert was said to either find this decision easy or difficult:
“Robert sees his decision as an easy one, and is able to decide quickly,” or “Robert finds this decision very difficult, and is only able to make it after much time, thought, and contemplation.”
Finally, Robert was said to have chosen to save Johnny, or to have chosen otherwise. Subjects were asked to rate Robert’s decision and describe their feelings about it in 8 ways. They were also asked to make 3 decisions on actions regarding Robert, including dismiss from job, punish, and end friendship. Using factor analysis all these responses were combined into an outrage factor, mainly weighted on 6 of the ratings and feelings, and a punish factor, mainly weighted on the 3 actions. These factors were on a 1-7 point scale. Here are the average factor values for the eight possible scenarios:
In the case of a taboo tradeoff, Robert is less likely to be punished for saving Johnny than for not. We have a strong social norm against trading sacred things for non-sacred things, and Robert is to be punished if he violates this taboo.","When Robert makes a sacred tradeoff, it is as if he must violate a norm no matter what he does. In this case, he is punished much more if he treats this as an easy choice; norm violation must be done in a serious thoughtful manner. However, when Robert makes a taboo tradoff, he is punished much more if he treats this as a difficult choice. In fact, he is punished almost as much for saving Johnny after much thought as he is for not saving Johnny after little thought! It is worse to do the wrong thing after careful thought than after little thought. Years ago, this result helped me to understand the political reaction when in 2003 my Policy Analysis Market (PAM) was accused of trying to let people bet on terrorist deaths. PAM appeared to some to cross a moral boundary, which can be paraphrased roughly as “none of us should intend to benefit when some of them hurt some of us.” (While many of us do in fact benefit from terrorist attacks, we can plausibly argue that we did not intend to do so.) So, by the taboo tradeoff effect, it was morally unacceptable for anyone in Congress or the administration to take a few days to think about the accusation. The moral calculus required an immediate response. Of course, no one at high decision-making levels knew much about a $1 million research project within a $1 trillion government budget. If PAM had been a $1 billion project, representatives from districts where that money was spent might have considered defending the project. But there was no such incentive for a $1 million project (spent mostly in California and London); the safe political response was obvious: repudiate PAM, and everyone associated with it. (more) Today, however, my interest is in what these results imply for our awareness of where our norm feelings come from, and how much they are shared by others. These results suggest that when we face a choice, the categorization of some of the options as norm violating is supposed to come to us fast, and with little thought or doubt. Unless we notice that all of the options violate similarly important norms, we are supposed to be sure of which options to reject, without needing to consult with other people, and without needing to try to frame the choice in multiple ways, to see if the relevant norms are subject to framing effects. We are to presume that framing effects are unimportant, and that everyone agrees on the relevant norms and how they are to be applied. Apparently the legal principle of “ignorance of the law is no excuse” isn’t just a convenient way to avoid incentives not to know the law, and to avoid having to inquire about who knows what laws. Regarding norms more generally, including legal norms, we seem to think “ignorance of the norms isn’t plausible; you must have known.” If this description is correct, it seems to me","But, in the case of a tragic tradeoff, there is no such social norm. Therefore, the taboo tradeoff is the more emotionally charged one, and the outrage factor is higher in that case. The paper says that taboo tradeoffs are more emotionally charged and thus more likely to invoke outrage. The paper also says that people are more likely to be punitive in the case of a taboo tradeoff than a tragic tradeoff.
So, what do the numbers mean? Let's see. The numbers are for the average of all scenarios. The first scenario is the classic tragic tradeoff: saving one life vs. saving another life. The second scenario is the taboo tradeoff: saving a life vs. using money for other purposes. The third scenario is the tragic tradeoff where the decision is hard. The fourth is the taboo tradeoff where the decision is hard. The fifth is the tragic tradeoff where the decision is easy. The sixth is the taboo tradeoff where the decision is easy. The seventh is the tragic tradeoff where Robert chooses to save the life. The eighth is the taboo tradeoff where Robert chooses to save the life.
So, the outrage factor is higher in the taboo tradeoffs. The punish factor is higher in the taboo tradeoffs. So, when a taboo tradeoff is presented, the outrage and punish factors are higher. However, when Robert is said to have made the decision to save the life, the outrage and punish factors are lower. Wait, in the first and third scenario, the decision is a tragic tradeoff. In the seventh scenario, the decision is a taboo tradeoff where Robert chose to save the life. The outrage factor is 4.2 in the seventh scenario, but 4.8 in the first scenario. Wait, that's a bit lower. Wait, the first scenario is a tragic tradeoff where the decision is easy. The seventh is a taboo tradeoff where the decision is easy and Robert chose to save the life.",482,500,327,0.1051,0.3515,0.9578,0.9006,0.9801,0.463,0.5,-13.2362,0.2936,0.3371,0.0227,0.086,0.0031,0.0278,0.5167,0.6476,0.9708,0.8594,0.3898916967509025,0.4456140350877193,0.41935483870967744,7,6,0.9795,0.8627,0.13485477178423236,0.118,0.14984709480122324,0.9025,0.5312,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Egan’s Zendegi.txt,"Greg Egan is one of my favorite science fiction authors, and his latest novel Zendegi (Kindle version costs a penny) seems to refer to this blog:
“You can always reach me through my blog! Overpowering Falsehood dot com, the number one site for rational thinking about the future—”
That is Nate Caplan, a self-centered arrogant rich American male nerd, who creepily stalks our Iranian female scientist hero Nasim Golestani, an expert in em (brain emulation) tech. Nate introduces himself this way:
I’m Nate Caplan. My IQ is one hundred and sixty. I’m in perfect physical and mental health. And I can pay you half a million dollars right now, any way you want it. Nate wants to pay so he can be the first em:
It’s very important to me that I’m the first transcendent being in this stellar system. I can’t risk having to compete with another resource-hungry entity; I have personal plans that require at least one Jovian mass of computronium. Nasim naturally despises Nate. So is Nate Caplan inspired by me, by my famously libertarian colleague Bryan Caplan, or by Eliezer Yudkowsky, who was my co-blogger back when Egan wrote this book? Consider that Egan’s book also contains a Benign Superintelligence Bootstrap Project, clearly modeled on Eliezer’s Singularity Institute:
Their aim is to build an artificial intelligence capable of such exquisite powers of self-analysis that it will design and construct its own successor. … The successor will then produce a still more proficient third version, and so on, leading to a cascade of exponentially increasing abilities. … Within weeks—perhaps within hours—a being of truly God-like powers will emerge. This institute is backed by an arrogant pompous “octogenarian oil billionaire” Zachary Churchland. To say more here, I’m going to have to give spoilers – you are warned. Both Churchland and Caplan end up succumbing to illness and being cryonically frozen. No other characters even consider cryonics, apparently seeing it as distasteful, and revival as a very long way off if possible at all. Everyone with any sense in the book treats the superintelligence folks as complete idiots, and after years spending billions:
The sum total of their achievements had amounted to a nine-hundred-page wish-list dressed up as a taxonomy, a fantasy of convenient but implausible properties for a vast imaginary hierarchy of software daemons and deities. While Nate Caplan’s “entire world view had been molded by tenth-rate science fiction,” he is at least somewhat reasonable. Nassim ends up choosing to team with Nate, who introduces Nassim to the key missing tech she lacked:
Side-loading is the process of training a neural network to mimic a particular organic brain, based on a rich set of non-intrusive scans of the brain in action. Together they make side-loads that successfully emulate parts of human brains, such as an athlete’s sport skills, in order to populate virtual reality games with human-like players.","Nasim starts to have second thoughts when she hears that Nate will try to use side-loads to displace half a billion human jobs. A league of powerful terrorist hackers then distrupts Nasim’s games, and issues demands: It’s unethical to create conscious software that lacks the ability to take control of its own destiny. … That’s where we draw the line: no higher functions, no language, no social skills. … If you want to make something human, make it whole. If you want to enable people to step from their bodies into virtual immortality, perfectly copied, with all their abilities preserved and all their rights intact… go ahead and do it, we have no problem with that. … But if you want to put humanity into a cheese grater and slice off little slavelets to pimp to the factories and the VR games, well … then you’ve got a war on your hands. Nasim isn’t convinced at first: None of the side-loads can be conscious in the human sense. They have no notion of their own past or future, no long-term memory, no personal goals. But at the very end of the novel Nasim is persuaded to join this hacker league to try to make ems illegal. What changes her mind? She tries to make a more complete side-load of Martin Seymour, who is dying of cancer, so the copy can guide Martin’s orphaned son. After extensive testing Nasim concludes: Either Virtual Martin felt nothing, or he felt exactly what he claimed to feel: love for his son, acceptance of his limitations, and contentment with the purpose for which he’d been brought into existence. The copy is quite intelligence and articulate – so far, so good. Then Martin tests his copy, named Jack, by pretending to be his son Javeed, inside a virtual reality game. “You fucking worthless piece of shit!” He tore the metal helmet from his head and threw it on the ground; his face was contorted with anger and disgust. “Baba, it’s just a game,” Martin pleaded. “Are you my son?” Jack raged. “Is this what that fucker Omar did to you?” “Baba, I’m sorry—” Martin stood his ground as Jack walked up to him and started flailing impotently with his fists at Sohrab’s giant body. Jack sank to his knees. “Is that what I taught you? You couldn’t help yourself, even when he begged for his life?” He clawed at the dirt. “What am I, then? What am I doing here?” He struck his head with his fists, distraught. “Baba, no one’s hurt, it’s just a game,” Martin insisted. He shared Jack’s revulsion at what they’d both witnessed; he had known full well the feelings that his act would provoke. But he was sure he could have held his own response in check for Javeed’s sake; he could have stood back from his anger and found some gentler rebuke than this. So because in a situation of extreme emotional stress one copy didn’t have the self-control that","This is the same as what I’ve written about in my previous blog posts on brain emulation.
Egan’s brain emulation technology is a lot like what I have written about, but the difference is that he is writing a novel, and not just a blog post. He is not just discussing the idea of brain emulation, but is using it as a plot device, and as a way to explore the ethical and philosophical implications of it. Egan’s book is a thought experiment, and as such is both entertaining and thought-provoking. I think the book is an excellent example of how science fiction can be used to explore the implications of new technologies. The novel also contains some interesting characters, and a compelling plot. The book is not just about the technology, but about the people who are involved in it, and the consequences of their actions.

(more)
For the last seventy years, we have lived in an era of improving computer hardware and software. As hardware got faster and cheaper, software engineers were able to write software at higher levels of abstraction. That and falling hardware costs and our expanding economy fueled an expanding software industry, with more clients asking software to do more things in more industries. Which has enabled software engineers to invest in making more better software tools to support it all. A virtuous cycle. During such an expanding era, the risks of switching some key task to software often paled to the risks of not switching. Not seeming at all inclined to switch soon could get you abandoned by customers and investors, or beaten by competitors. In contrast, jumping in a bit too early mainly risks increased costs for a short period until you find a better software supplier. Your failure will still give you valuable experience to inform your next attempt, and better solutions are likely on their way, offered by more numerous suppliers who compete more strongly for your business. When software suppliers themselves choose what other software suppliers to rely on, they should in principle worry about how long each supplier’s software will be supported, and whether they will raise their prices. But in an expanding software world these are only mild concerns. If some suppliers die or raise their prices, other superior options will probably become available soon. So the usual practice of mostly ignoring future issues works out pretty well. A similar calculation applies to software maintenance. You might be sloppy and let your software rot faster than it would otherwise have done. But if your product is near state of the art in features, then expanded revenue from your expanded base of customers will usually let you rewrite it all from scratch later. So you worry mostly about staying state of the art, and less about how fast your software rots. However, roughly thirty years from now world population will peak, and the world economy will peak not long after. Population and the economy will soon fall by a factor of two every one or two generations. The world’s innovation rate will shrink a bit faster than does this exponentially shrinking economy, and thus innovation, including software innovation, will seem to grind to a halt within a few generations. In this new shrinking world, computer hardware stops improving, and the accumulation of durable hardware may basically end the computer hardware industry.","(Which may itself end much software progress.) When the economy isn’t large enough to support the huge fixed costs of the computer hardware industry, who will want to pay more for new hardware that isn’t better than plentiful durable old hardware? In a shrinking world without software innovation, most software suppliers will not be able to count on increasing customer revenue to fund routinely rewriting their software from scratch when it rots. And there won’t be new tools to let new versions be better than old ones. So suppliers will instead pay increasing sums to maintain existing rotting software, and not fear future consequences of raising prices today. As their customer base falls, they must change each remaining customer more, until so many drop away that they must stop maintenance. Cascading failures by their own software suppliers force each supplier to either find a replacement for each support failure, to cut features, or to fail themselves. As suppliers drop out, once competitive software areas become duopolies, then monopolies, then non-maintained products. In this world, firms who recently assigned some key task to software could regret that choice, as they face the hard choice of paying increasing costs for software of declining functionality, or switching back to not using software. Instead of eagerly seeking to join a new expanding world of software, they would be looking to escape their reliance on software, for fear of increasingly hungry and bitey software suppliers bleeding them to death. In a shrinking world economy, falling populations would raise the cost of supplying city services to partially populated cities. Which would induce people to abandon some cities in order to fill up a few populated cities, to keep city service prices low. Then might even abandon whole nations to crowd into a few remaining ones. Similarly, the world would abandon entire alternative computing ecosystems, such as languages and operating systems, so that they could better share the costs of supporting the few remaining ecosystems. Those who bet on the wrong ecosystems and found it hard to switch would lose big time. The winners in this new world would be those who limited their dependence on software to simple systems with limited features that they could maintain mostly themselves, needing minimal support from outsiders. The bitten losers would be those who came to depend on complex systems with too many features that the world could no longer support. Declining scale economies, such as from losing most software, would slowly lower per-capita income in this declining world, but it would probably take over a millennia for this to induce sufficient poverty to raise fertility. And, alas, learning about this dark decline scenario will not be enough to scare nations into implementing the feasible fix: borrowing to pay enough to parents to induce over replacement fertility. Instead, rapidly growing insular fertile subcultures like the Amish and Haredi Jews will eventually restore growth by coming to dominate the world population. Eventually, when the new economy gets larger than its prior","Software, however, will continue to evolve as long as there are people using it. Software is a bit different from hardware. Software is not durable. It is the product of people, and people can change it. Software is not a physical thing, and thus it can be changed. So, even if the world economy shrinks, software can continue to evolve, and thus software will continue to be used. But in a shrinking world, the software that is used may not be the same as the software that was used before. So, the world will have to adjust. But in this shrinking world, the cost of maintaining software will be higher. Because the number of people who can maintain it will be smaller. And software will have to be written in a way that is easier to maintain, and that is more likely to be compatible with other software. Because the number of people who can understand it is smaller, and the number of software tools that can help you understand and maintain it is smaller. This is the opposite of the previous situation. In the expanding world, software was easy to use, and it was easy to maintain. Because there were many people who could use and maintain it, and many software tools that could help. Now, in a shrinking world, software is hard to use and hard to maintain. Because the number of people who can use and maintain it is smaller, and the number of software tools that can help is smaller. (more)
I think we have to make a fundamental change in our approach to the software engineering. I think that we need to move from a system that is built to be maintained by a single person to a system that is built to be maintained by a team.

Robin Hanson,Which Of Your Origins Are You_.txt,"Most people assimilate the values of their local culture, some of which they can express abstractly, and mix that with their genetic personality, individual experiences, and maybe also some thoughts, to produce the values they use to make decisions over their lifetimes. Such values usually have enough detail to adequately address the actual world that they will typically face, even though such values are quite vaguely specified relative to the set of all possible worlds that one could possibly face. That is, if given a random possible choice from the space of all possible choices, most people would hardly know what to do, and if forced to choose would mostly react rather randomly to random surface features of the situation. We were not evolved or socialized to live in random worlds. This is a problem for philosophers or futurists who make it their job to think about worlds very different from their own. How can we figure out what we want (or equivalently, “see as good”) in such strange contexts? To my eyes, most make relatively naive and shallow projections from their current culture-specific values to such strange worlds, projections that don’t account well for the historical contingencies that lead their local cultures to have the values that they have. Can we do better? Here are some of the sources we can draw on to estimate our values:
Actual Actions. We can look at our past actions, and presume that in the future we’d want to do something like what we did in the past. Action Intuitions. We can imagine various possible choice situations, and see which choices our intuitions favor then. Outcome intuitions. We can imagine various possible choice outcomes, and see which of those outcomes our intuitions like. Pattern intuitions. We often notice simple patterns in our choices or outcomes they like, and ask our intuitions if we approve of them. Associates’ Data. We can include the actions and intuitions of our associates, not just ourselves, as part of the data we use. Interpolation. We can use a simplicity prior to interpolate from actual cases of acts or intuitions to other cases. Curve Fitting. We can use a simplicity prior to fit an all-case “curve” which doesn’t exactly match our actual acts and intuitions. Principles. Theorists often work to find less obvious patterns which roughly fit actions or intuitions, and propose “principles” to account for them. Causal Origins. Our theories of the causal processes that made us can suggest deeper simpler “curves” to fit to our acts/intuitions. Others’ Synthesis. We can look to how others synthesize all these sources into their best guess values, and try to do like they do. Most people seem to endorse some of their pattern intuitions, even when those are at odds with specific acts and intuitions. They thus endorse at least some error theory, whereby undesired errors have influenced their specific past actions and intuitions.","Such error theories justify not only rejecting specific intuitions in favor of curve-fitting alternatives, but can also favor deeper “curves” that account more for our causal origins. The key hard question here is this: what aspects of the causal influences that lead to you do you now embrace, and which do you instead reject as “random” errors that you want to cut out? Consider two extremes. At one extreme, one could endorse absolutely every random element that contributed to any prior choice or intuition. When there is any possible way to interpret apparent inconsistencies as actually consistent according to some complex tortured theory, you embrace such a theory. You could also embrace any random framing or context that led to any particular choice. Sure, you admit that you might randomly have made a different choice, if that context had been different, but now that you’ve made that choice, you became the new you who values it, and you intend to keep future choices consistent with all random past choices. Or maybe just embrace all future random choices, regardless of consistency with past choices. At the other extreme, you might see yourself as primarily the result of natural selection, both of genes and of memes, and see your core non-random value as that of doing the best you can to continue to “win” at that game. You can see the many contingent choices made so far in constructing you, and the choices that you have made during your life, as all being random best guesses about how to win at that game, guesses that you are willing to reject as errors if you learn that they no longer seem so effective at wining. In this view, everything about you that won’t help your descendants be selected in the long run is a random error that you want to detect and reject. In between these two extremes, you embraces as part of the “core” you some aspects that were once evolutions best guess at winning the natural selection game, even if it turns out that they later came to seem less plausibly winning strategies. Yet you reject other random influences on you as errors that get in the say of that “core” you trying to achieve its core ends. But how exactly can you choose where to draw this line, between historical influences that you embrace, and those you reject? As I discussed above, the usual approach is to just assimilate the values of your culture without reflecting much on what line that implies. If the other people around you act in a certain way, you can feel pretty safe assuming that you won’t be overly criticized for acting in similar ways. But the more that you try to extrapolate such values to strange possible situations, the less sure you can be that others would extrapolate in the same way. Yes, you could just join some particular community that specializes in such topics, and conform to the recent choices of its most","So, maybe we can do better than naive projections by using these more elaborate methods, and in fact, maybe we can do better than even those methods? Perhaps. But I have yet to see any method that can be clearly shown to be better than the naive method. I have not yet seen any method that can be clearly shown to be better than the naive method. So, if we can’t show that we have better methods, then perhaps we must accept the naive method. But that seems like a problem. If we accept the naive method, then we are just as vulnerable as those who make naive projections. The problem is that the naive method, while not as effective as some other methods, is not as bad as the alternative of simply making up values, which is the alternative of the naive method. So, what is the alternative? The alternative is to make up values. If we can’t do better than the naive method, then we have to accept the naive method, but if we can do better, then we can do better. But how do we know which is the case? It seems like a question that can’t be answered by empirical means. So, what is the answer? I think it is that we should do the best we can with the tools we have. But I also think that we should be open to the possibility that we might be wrong. This is the point of the ""skeptical theist"" position, I think. So, given all this, what is the conclusion? That we have to live with the consequences of our values, whether we are right or wrong, and that we should try to be as good as we can with the tools we have. 

This is a very long, complex, and philosophical text. I have read it through once, and I am now trying to summarize it in a more manageable way.

Robin Hanson,Status Explains Lots.txt,"Some complain that I try to explain too much of human behavior via signaling. But the social brain hypothesis and common observations suggest that we quite often do things with an eye to how they will make us look to others. Here’s another big influence on human behavior strongly supported by both theory and common sense: status. While it seems obvious that dominance and prestige matter greatly in human behavior, even so it seems to me that we social scientists neglect them, just as we neglect signaling. In this post, I will try to support this claim. Humans have only domesticated a tiny fraction of animal species, even smart primates. In fact, apes seem plenty smart and dexterous enough to support a real Planet of the Apes scenario, wherein apes do many useful jobs. The main problem is that apes see our giving them orders as an attempt to dominate them, which they sometimes fiercely resist. And humans are if anything more sensitive to domination than are other primates. After all, while other primates had visible accepted dominance hierarchies, human foragers created “reverse dominance hierarchies” wherein the whole band (of ~20-50) coordinated to take down anyone who would try to overtly dominate them. Which both makes it plausible that dominance matters a lot to humans, and also raises the question of how it is that we’ve come to accept so much of it. Farmers accepted more domination that did foragers; farmers had kings, classes, wealth inequality, slavery, and generals in war. But most farmers didn’t actually spend much time being directly dominated. War wasn’t the usual condition, most workers had no bosses, and most of their interactions were with people at their same level. But in the modern world, most workers put up with far more than would most foragers or farmers. Our performance is frequently evaluated, we are ranked in great detail compared to many others around us, and we are given many detailed orders, and not just during an apprenticeship period. All of which allows our complex modern organizations and social interactions, the key to industrial-era wealth, but which raises the key question: how did we get Dom-averse humans to accept all this? Bosses: It might seem odd to ask what bosses are for, as they have so many plausible functions to perform in orgs. Yet to explain many details, such as the kinds of people we pick for management, and the ways they spend their time, we must still ask which of these functions are the most important. And my guess is that one of the most important is to give workers excuses to obey them. Here’s the simple story: we often have a choice about whether to frame an interaction as due to dominance or prestige. Humans are supposed to hate dominance, but to love prestige.","So if we can frame our boss as prestigious, not dominant, we can tell ourselves and others that we are following their lead out of admiration and wanting to learn from them, not from fear of being fired. If so, firms will want to spend extra on hiring prestigious bosses, who are handsome, articulate, tall, well-educated, pro-social, smooth, etc., even if those features don’t that much improve management decisions. Which does in fact seem to be the case. School: I’ve discussed several times my story that schools use prestige to train people to take orders: When firms and managers from rich places try to transplant rich practices to poor places, giving poor place workers exactly the same equipment, materials, procedures, etc., one of the main things that goes wrong is that poor place workers just refuse to do what they are told. They won’t show up for work reliably on time, have many problematic superstitions, hate direct orders, won’t accept tasks and roles that that deviate from their non-work relative status with co-workers, and won’t accept being told to do tasks differently than they had done them before, especially when new ways seem harder. … How did the industrial era get at least some workers to accept more domination, inequality, and ambiguity, and why hasn’t that worked equally well everywhere? … prestigious schools. … if humans hate industrial workplace practices when they see them as bosses dominating, but love to copy the practices of prestigious folks, an obvious solution is to habituate kids into modern workplace practices in contexts that look more like the latter than the former. … while early jobs threaten to trip the triggers than make most animals run from domination, schools try to frame a similar habit practice in more acceptable terms, as more like copying prestigious people. … Start with prestigious teachers [teaching prestigious topics]. … Have students take several classes at at a time, so they have no single “boss” … Make class attendance optional, and let students pick their classes.… give … complex assignments with new ambiguous instructions,… lots of students per teacher, … to create social proof that other students accept all of this. Frequently and publicly rank student performance, using the excuse of helping students to learn. In two recent twitter polls, I found a 7-2 ratio saying college teachers were more impressive/prestigious than one’s job supervisor then, and a 2-1 ratio for high school teachers. Many descriptions of teaching describe the impressiveness and status of teachers as central to the teaching process. Governance: we are even more sensitive to dominance in our political leaders than in our workplace bosses. Which was why all though history, each place tended to think they had a noble king, while neighbors had despicable tyrants. And why prestige was so important for kings. In the last few centuries we upped the ante via democracy, a supposedly prestigious mechanism wherein we pretend that all of us are really “ultimately” in control of the government, allowing us","So we have a tendency to frame interactions as being about prestige, not dominance. But when we do this, we have to give the boss a reason to be prestigious. That is, we have to give them an excuse to obey them. But why would we do this? Because it’s not enough to just have the boss be prestigious. We also have to have a reason to think that the boss is in the same direction as us. In other words, the boss has to be someone we can be proud of. So, the boss has to be someone we think is good, and who is good in the right way. This is a bit abstract, so let me try to make it more concrete. Imagine that you have a boss who is a jerk. You don’t like him. He’s not nice, but he’s also not bad. He’s not a tyrant, but he’s not a kind person. He’s just a mean, unkind, unempathetic, and unresponsive person. You don’t like him, but you don’t have a reason to disobey him. You don’t know that he’s corrupt, and he doesn’t seem to have a hidden agenda. He just seems to be a jerk. In this case, you don’t have a reason to disobey, but you also don’t have a reason to obey. But if you think that he’s a person who is in the right direction, who is good, and who is good in the right way, then you can have a reason to obey. So, the function of bosses is not to dominate, but to be prestigious. That is, bosses must be seen as prestigious, and thus as someone we can be proud of. And for that to be the case, we have to give them reasons to be prestigious, which is where the idea of status comes in. The key is that people are supposed to be good in the right way, and that the boss is supposed to",470,500,329,0.1797,0.0762,0.9724,0.9163,0.9035,0.6884,2.3203,-6.7708,0.3841,0.2967,0.0338,0.0292,0.0021,0.0025,0.4421,0.432,0.9828,0.9623,0.4256505576208178,0.37521514629948366,0.5847665847665847,7,4,0.9741,0.9886,0.125531914893617,0.142,0.1458966565349544,0.8472,0.5624,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Stasis is Illiberal.txt,"A stereotypical “illiberal” society is culturally and socially static and conservative, tightly bound, and suspicious of outsiders. Each is run by a coalition of elites who maintain strong discretionary control over key social areas: government, law, commerce, religion, culture, and public talk. Such societies can react in swift, decisive, and unified ways to external military threats and opportunities. But in illiberal societies, elite coalitions also coordinate well to suppress competition that challenges their leadership in these key areas. And they can ensure that their children become the elites of the next generation. This hinders such societies from adapting fast to anything but changes in military context and internal elite alliances. But that didn’t much matter when other kinds of change were quite slow or unimportant. A few centuries ago, however, parts of the world started to grow much faster, due to faster rates of change and innovation. (Innovation is effective change that accumulates, caused by invention plus diffusion.) Coincidentally, that’s about when and where science, democracy, printing, travel, commerce, finance, and orgs became much bigger things. And also roughly when and where societies became more “liberal”, with elite coalitions having less discretion to suppress competition in key areas. This liberality was supported not just by new tech, but also by new laws and social norms. That is, liberal societies had relatively neutral rules and norms supporting democratic competition for control of governance. Freedom of religion and the press supported freer competition in those areas. Stronger norms of neutral law limited law’s value to elites in suppressing rivals. Stronger travel, property rights, free trade, and neutrally-enforced law supported stronger competition in commerce. Stronger neutral competition in school and prestige career paths also made it harder for kids of elites to inherit elite positions. Furthermore, culture and norms came more to expect and support big competition-enabled innovations in many areas of society. I propose that this correlation in time and space between liberality and innovation was not a coincidence, and that substantial causation went both ways. That is, not only did liberality promote innovation, but innovation also promoted liberality. Less liberal societies were seen to fall behind and look “backwards” in international competitions related to commerce, war tech, population, and culture, all because they less supported innovation. So the world learned this rough lesson: winning societies must support sufficiently neutral competition to allow internal innovation. Societies lose when they give elite coalitions overly great discretion to suppress competition in government, law, commerce, religion, culture, and public talk. Of course even today this lesson has been only partly learned. Many rankings of nations are available showing that large factions of nations are still pretty illiberal. Many local elite coalitions still see great gains for themselves from suppressing rivals in key areas. And if they expected weaker gains from innovation, they’d feel more free to move further in that direction. It is thus in substantial part an expectation of rapid valuable innovation that holds them back, and has pushed nations to be more liberal.","I’ve said that world population looks to peak soon and then fall far, and that econ theory predicts the world economy will then also fall, with innovation rates falling in rough proportion to economic activity. Thus as population falls, innovation will “grind to a halt.” Many have asked why that is such a bad thing. Yes, the population will be older, and we will lose scale economies, but we would also put less pressure on nature, and it might be good to take more time to consider what social changes we really want. The above is my response. When innovation grinds to a halt, so also will many of the social pressures that have driven and supported liberalism. There will be less of an expectation of substantial innovation, and less of a presumption that such innovation is good. Local elites will still want to coordinate to suppress rivals, and they will less need to fear that this will put their society at a disadvantage in international competitions. So they may tend more to empower state religions and ideologies, stronger censorship of “misinformation”, more elite-coalition-favoring discretion in legal rulings, more discretionary regulations that can take down rivals in commerce, and more elite-coalition-favoring discretion in school and prestige career admissions and promotion. This isn’t a hypothetical problem. Both the ancient Greek and Roman civilizations became substantially less liberal in their declining phases, both of which were caused in part by low fertility leading to a falling population, phases accompanied by less innovation and effective adaptation to changing conditions. Declining eras of Chinese empires also seem to have been less liberal on average, compared to growth eras. Honestly I think we already see these sort of less-liberal trends to a modest degree in the last few decades, correlated with a modest decline in innovation rates. But with a big rapid population decline the effects will be far more dramatic. I predict that societies will become far less liberal during the coming great innovation pause, further suppressing innovation. Yes, maybe it will be your religion/ideology that they enshrine, your enemies they censor, and rivals to your kids and firms they suppress. That is, maybe you will be a favored elite. But will that really be good for the world? While this pause might last for several centuries, eventually some insular fertile subcultures is likely to grow enough that world population will rise again. But the insular fertile subcultures we see around us now are quite far from liberal, and so it might take quite a big longer for liberality to rise again on Earth. If it ever does. Added 12Jan: In The Moral Consequences of Economic Growth, Benjamin Freidman says A rising standard of living for the clear majority of citizens more often than not fosters greater opportunity, tolerance of diversity, social mobility, commitment to fairness, and dedication to democracy. (more) However, he sees “liberality” more in terms of openness, kindness, tolerance, and redistribution than support for competition, and his explanation for the association","So, the lesson is that societies must support sufficient competition in key areas to allow innovation. That is, innovation is the key to national strength. If you don’t support innovation, you’re not going to be strong. So, the conclusion is: if you want to be strong, you must be liberal. And if you are not liberal, you are not strong. But the lesson is not that all liberal societies are strong, nor that all strong societies are liberal. The lesson is that strength requires liberal values, but not that liberal values alone make a society strong. In other words, the key is to support innovation, not just to be liberal. That is, the key is to have the right kind of liberal values, not just to be liberal. But the lesson is also that, if you are not liberal, you are not strong. So, the conclusion is that: if you want to be strong, you must be liberal. And if you are not liberal, you are not strong.

In summary, the article argues that the correlation between liberal societies and innovation is not coincidental, but rather that both innovation and liberal values promote each other. Liberal societies foster innovation by allowing competition in key areas, while innovation leads to the development of liberal values. The author concludes that to be strong, a society must be liberal, but not all liberal societies are strong, and not all strong societies are liberal. The key is to support innovation through the right kind of liberal values.

Robin Hanson,I Still Don’t Get Foom.txt,"Back in 2008 my ex-co-blogger Eliezer Yudkowsky and I discussed his “AI foom” concept, a discussion that we recently spun off into a book. I’ve heard for a while that Nick Bostrom was working on a book elaborating related ideas, and this week his Superintelligence was finally available to me to read, via Kindle. I’ve read it now, along with a few dozen reviews I’ve found online. Alas, only the two reviews on GoodReads even mention the big problem I have with one of his main premises, the same problem I’ve had with Yudkowsky’s views. Bostrom hardly mentions the issue in his 300 pages (he’s focused on control issues). All of which makes it look like I’m the one with the problem; everyone else gets it. Even so, I’m gonna try to explain my problem again, in the hope that someone can explain where I’m going wrong. Here goes. “Intelligence” just means an ability to do mental/calculation tasks, averaged over many tasks. I’ve always found it plausible that machines will continue to do more kinds of mental tasks better, and eventually be better at pretty much all of them. But what I’ve found it hard to accept is a “local explosion.” This is where a single machine, built by a single project using only a tiny fraction of world resources, goes in a short time (e.g., weeks) from being so weak that it is usually beat by a single human with the usual tools, to so powerful that it easily takes over the entire world. Yes, smarter machines may greatly increase overall economic growth rates, and yes such growth may be uneven. But this degree of unevenness seems implausibly extreme. Let me explain. If we count by economic value, humans now do most of the mental tasks worth doing. Evolution has given us a brain chock-full of useful well-honed modules. And the fact that most mental tasks require the use of many modules is enough to explain why some of us are smarter than others. (There’d be a common “g” factor in task performance even with independent module variation.) Our modules aren’t that different from those of other primates, but because ours are different enough to allow lots of cultural transmission of innovation, we’ve out-competed other primates handily. We’ve had computers for over seventy years, and have slowly build up libraries of software modules for them. Like brains, computers do mental tasks by combining modules. An important mental task is software innovation: improving these modules, adding new ones, and finding new ways to combine them. Ideas for new modules are sometimes inspired by the modules we see in our brains. When an innovation team finds an improvement, they usually sell access to it, which gives them resources for new projects, and lets others take advantage of their innovation. Since software is often fragile and context dependent, much innovation consists of making new modules that are rather similar to old ones, except that they work in somewhat different contexts.","We try to avoid this fragility via abstraction, but this is usually hard. Today humans also produce most of the value in innovations tasks, though software sometimes helps. We even try to innovate new ways to innovate, but that is also very hard. Overall we so far just aren’t very good at writing software to compete with the rich well-honed modules in human brains. And we are bad at making software to make more software. But computer hardware gets cheaper, software libraries grow, and we learn more tricks for making better software. Over time, software will get better. And in centuries, it may rival human abilities. In this context, Bostrom imagines that a single “machine intelligence project” builds a “system” or “machine” that follows the following trajectory: “Human baseline” represents the effective intellectual capabilities of a representative human adult with access to the information sources and technological aids currently available in developed countries. … “The crossover”, a point beyond which the system’s further improvement is mainly driven by the system’s own actions rather than by work performed upon it by others. … Parity with the combined intellectual capability of all of humanity (again anchored to the present) … [is] “civilization baseline”. These usual “technological aids” include all of the other software available for sale in the world. So apparently the reason the “baseline” and “civilization” marks are flat is that this project is not sharing its innovations with the rest of the world, and available tools aren’t improving much during the period shown. Bostrom distinguishes takeoff durations that are fast (minutes, hours, or days), moderate (months or years), or slow (decades or centuries) and says “a fast or medium takeoff looks more likely.” As it now takes the world economy fifteen years to double, Bostrom sees one project becoming a “singleton” that rules all: The nature of the intelligence explosion does encourage a winner-take-all dynamic. In this case, if there is no extensive collaboration before the takeoff, a singleton is likely to emerge – a single project would undergo the transition alone, at some point obtaining a decisive strategic advantage. Bostrom accepts there there might be more than one such project, but suggests that likely only the first one would matter, because the time delays between projects would be like the years and decades we’ve seen between when different nations could build various kinds of nuclear weapons or rockets. Presumably these examples set the rough expectations we should have in mind for the complexity, budget, and secrecy of the machine intelligence projects Bostrom has in mind. In Bostrom’s graph above the line for an initially small project and system has a much higher slope, which means that it becomes in a short time vastly better at software innovation. Better than the entire rest of the world put together. And my key question is: how could it plausibly do that? Since the rest of the world is already trying the best it can to usefully innovate, and to abstract to promote","So, the software industry is a kind of “mimicry industry,” where we use our knowledge of the old to make the new.

Robin Hanson,On Evolved Values.txt,"Biological evolution selects roughly for creatures that do whatever it takes to have more descendants in the long run. When such creatures have brains, those brains are selected for having supporting habits. And to the extent that such brains can be described as having beliefs and values that combine into actions via expected utility theory, then these beliefs and values should be ones which are roughly behaviorally-equivalent to the package of having accurate beliefs, and having values to produce many descendants (relative to rivals). Equivalent at least within the actual environments in which those creatures were selected. Humans have unusually general brains, with which we can think unusually abstractly about our beliefs and values. But so far, we haven’t actually abstracted our values very far. We instead have a big mess of opaque habits and desires that implicitly define our values for us, in ways that we poorly understand. Even though what evolution has been selecting for in us can in fact be described concisely and effectively in an abstract way. Which leads to one of the most disturbing theoretical predictions I know: with sufficient further evolution, our descendants are likely to directly and abstractly know that they simply value more descendants. In diverse and varying environments, such a simpler more abstract representation seems likely to be more effective at helping them figure out which actions would best achieve that value. And while I’ve personally long gotten used to the idea that our distant descendants will be weird, to (the admittedly few) others who care about the distant future, this vision must seem pretty disturbing. Oh there are some subtleties regarding whether all kinds of long-term descendants get the same weight, to what degree such preferences are non-monotonic in time and number of descendants, and whether we care the same about risks that are correlated or not across descendants. But those are details: evolved descendants should more simply and abstractly value more descendants. This applies whether our descendants are biological or artificial. And it applies regardless of the kind of environments our descendants face, as long as those environments allow for sufficient selection. For example, if our descendants live among big mobs, who punish them for deviations from mob-enforced norms, then our descendants will be selected for pleasing their mobs. But as an instrumental strategy for producing more descendants. If our descendants have a strong democratic world government that enforces rules about who can reproduce how, then they will be selected for gaining influence over that government in order to gain its favors. And for an autocratic government, they’d be selected for gaining its favors. Nor does this conclusion change greatly if the units of future selection are larger than individual organisms. Even if entire communities or work teams reproduce together as single units, they’d still be selected for valuing reproduction, both of those entire units and of component parts.","And if physical units are co-selected with supporting cultural features, those total physical-plus-cultural packages must still tend to favor the reproduction of all parts of those packages. Many people seem to be confused about cultural selection, thinking that they are favored by selection if any part of their habits or behaviors is now growing due to their actions. But if, for example, your actions are now contributing to a growing use of the color purple in the world, that doesn’t at all mean that you are winning the evolutionary game. If wider use of purple is not in fact substantially favoring the reproduction of the other elements of the package by which you are now promoting purple’s growth, and if those other elements are in fact reproducing less than their rivals, then you are likely losing, not winning, the evolutionary game. Purple will stop growing and likely decline after those other elements sufficiently decline. Yes of course, you might decide that you don’t care that much to win this evolutionary game, and are instead content to achieve the values that you now have, with the resources that you can now muster. But you must then accept that tendencies like yours will become a declining fraction of future behavior. You are putting less weight on the future compared to others who focus more on reproduction. The future won’t act like you, or be as much influenced by acts like yours. For example, there are “altruistic” actions that you might take now to help out civilization overall. For example, you might build a useful bridge, or find some useful invention. But if by such actions you hurt the relative long-term reproduction of many or most of the elements that contributed to your actions, then you must know you are reducing the tendency of descendants to do such actions. Ask: is civilization really better off with more such acts today, but fewer such acts in the future? Yes, we can likely identify some parts of our current packages which are hurting, not helping, our reproduction. Such as genetic diseases. Or destructive cultural elements. It makes sense to dump such parts of our reproduction “teams” when we can identify them. But that fact doesn’t negate the basic story here: we will mainly value reproduction. The only way out I see is: stop evolution. Stop, or slow to a crawl, the changes that induce selection of features that influence reproduction. This would require a strong civilization-wide government, and it only works until we meet the other grabby aliens. Worse, in an actually changing universe, such stasis seems to me to seriously risk rot. Leading to a slowly rotting civilization, clinging on to its legacy values but declining in influence, at least relative to its potential. This approach doesn’t at all seems worth the cost to me. But besides that, have a great day. Added 7p: There many be many possible equilibria, in which case it may be possible to find an equilibrium in which maximizing","In the same way, if we think of the Earth as a unit, then we’d be selected for valuing the Earth’s reproduction. So if the Earth were to be destroyed, then we’d be selected for not doing that. But the Earth’s reproduction is a complicated and ambiguous concept, and the same goes for larger units. So the more abstract we get, the more ambiguous and vague the concept of what we value becomes. This is not a problem for the theory, because the theory is only about what we value. It is not about what we ought to do. The theory is not saying that we should value more descendants. It is saying that, given the way evolution works, we are going to be selected for valuing more descendants. So the theory is not a prescriptive one, but a descriptive one. It is a descriptive theory of what values we are going to have, in the future, given the way evolution works. And if we are going to be selected for valuting more descendants, then we should be careful about what we value now. Because the future values will be selected for in a way that is influenced by what we value now. So the theory suggests that we should try to make sure that the values that are selected for in the future are not ones that are bad for the long-term future. But in the long term, the future is going to be very different from the present. So, even if we are now trying to value more descendants, we might be selecting for values that are bad for the future. For example, if we are now selecting for values that prioritize the well-being of a few people, then in the future, that might lead to values that are very bad for the long-term future. So, in order to prevent that, we need to make sure that our current values are not ones that would be selected for in the future. So this is a kind of long-termist problem. If we can solve this problem, then",480,500,348,0.1441,0.3175,0.938,0.8905,0.8458,0.8063,-3.5842,-4.5013,0.3724,0.4057,0.0301,0.0803,0.0,0.0203,0.5466,0.5457,0.967,0.9632,0.4485981308411215,0.4591304347826087,0.5721518987341773,6,7,0.9858,0.9885,0.10625,0.128,0.1235632183908046,0.9528,0.5848,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,The Return of _Commune-ism_.txt,"The most likely scenario by which world human fertility will rise again includes a big return to communism. It will be a small-scale religious “commune” form of “commune-ism”, not industrial state “communism”, but “communism” of a sort nonetheless. (Bryan Caplan prefers the word “communitarianism” here.)
To see why, note two big facts about fertility. The first big fact is that human fertility (kids per woman in her lifetime) has been robustly and consistently falling since it first started to do so in France ~250 years ago. Most of the world is now below replacement fertility, and the rest should soon follow, resulting in a world population peak in about thirty years, and a world economy peak not long after. After “hovering” near that peak for a few to many decades, population will likely then fall by half every generation or two. (That’s my guess; UN predicts much a much slower fall.) The economy will fall a bit faster, due to shrinking innovation rates and scale economies. Extinction follows in ~800-1600 years unless we see a bigger change to fertility trends than we’ve seen in the last 250 years. The most obvious correlate of this fertility fall is rising society income, but that income is correlated with many other things, some of which may contribute more directly than income to falling fertility. Such as longer lifespans, more birth control, weaker gender roles, weaker religion, more schooling, more urbanization, weaker families, more individualism, and more integration into world culture. Most of these correlates were visible in France ~200 years ago, and we can now see in detail many of the social pressures that line up to keep fertility down. The second big fact to keep in mind about fertility is that we have seen many small but consistent exceptions to this global fertility fall, exceptions which have many distinctive features in common. For example, Orthodox Jews, Salafist Muslims, Mormons, Laestadian Lutherans, and especially Anabaptists such as Amish, Mennonites and Hutterites. Some of these have maintained their distinctive cultures and high fertility for very long periods. Amish, for example, have doubled roughly every twenty years for over a century. These groups tend to be fertile, insular, religious, pacifist, rural, and family-oriented. They uphold traditional gender roles, discourage birth control, limit years of schooling, maintain internal censorship, limit tech to maintain social isolation, and are made of small laregly-independent communities of about a hundred which split when they get large. And they tend to be communal, with mostly shared property, collective choices of activities and roles, and strong norms governing behaviors which are quite egalitarian re differences in talk, dress, housing, etc. Christianity was once such an insular family-oriented often-communal religious cult which started small but eventually came to dominate the Roman Empire 300 years later mainly due to its doubling in numbers roughly every forty years. Orthodox Jews started as a small fraction of Israel in 1948 but are now 13%, and should be a majority within a few decades.","If they maintain past growth rates, Amish would number 300 million in two centuries, dominating the U.S. well before then. Of course such groups may face new obstacles as they grow. For example, while Mormons started with many small insular fertile groups much like these other groups, a central Mormon organization reined in extremists to gain acceptance of outsiders. And now Mormon fertility falls as fast as non-religious comparables, just with a twenty year delay. Other possible obstacles include subgroups splitting off and adopting less fertility-friendly habits, pacifism making them vulnerable to war, troubles entering more urban complex economic sectors, and outsiders forcing changes due to moral indignation at their deviant practices. Even so, with so many social forces blocking shared global culture from drifting toward high fertility, and so few examples of that drift happening in recent centuries, insular fertile subcultures seem a strong candidate for how fertility might rise. And as new stable versions don’t arise often, existing versions offer good guesses for what future versions might look like. Can theory helps us organize this data? I’ve previously tried to explain our fertility fall as an evolutionary mistake. When ancestors started living in larger social groups with stronger status ladders, “kings and queens” arose who gained high reproductive success. Evolution (some combo of DNA and culture) then endowed us with the following heuristic: pay more for status markers, relative to number of kids, when we or kids have an unusually high chance to become king or queen. (This heuristic should trigger more on markers of dominance status, not prestige status, as prestige differences aren’t sufficient to create kings and queens.) This heuristic should have triggered on having unusually high relative wealth, but as average society wealth rarely varied much back then across societies, evolution took a shortcut and actually triggered it on high absolute wealth. So once our whole world become rich, a crazy deviation from all prior history, our heuristic misfired; we all now implicitly and mistakenly guess that we have a good chance of being king or queen, and cut fertility in response. (All unconsciously of course.) It makes sense for this heuristic to also check if one’s society is big enough, and has enough status inequality, to support kings and queens. No point in cutting fertility to invest in status markers if your world has no kings and queens. And these checks can explain why the exceptional subcultures that have maintained high fertility in our rich world are small isolated egalitarian communal ones. Isolation limits attention to the local group, where one sees a group too small and with too little (dominance) status inequality to support kings and queens. And so members of these exceptional subcultures don’t trigger the usual heuristic that induces rich folks to cut fertility to gain status markers to increase the chances they or their kids become kings or queens. Can we explain the other observed correlates of recent insular fertile subcultures? Rural locations, censorship, and pacifism make social isolation easier;","So the question is, can such a religious “commune” form of “commune-ism” (which I prefer to call “communitarianism”) be made to happen on a large scale, and what would that take? The answer is that it would take a huge shift in the world’s attitudes toward family life, which is unlikely to happen unless people are forced to change, as in the case of the Amish. So the most likely scenario by which world human fertility will rise again is a big return to a small-scale religious “commune” form of “commune-ism”, not industrial state “communism”, but “communism” of a sort nonetheless. (Bryan Caplan prefers the word “communitarianism” here.)
Now, the author's point is that the only way for world fertility to rise again is for people to return to a small-scale religious ""commune"" form of ""communitarianism"", which is not industrial state ""communism"". The author is not saying that people will return to a state communist system, but a small-scale religious group that is communal, family-oriented, etc. The author is not saying that people will return to industrial state communism, but a small-scale religious ""commune"" that is communal, family-oriented, etc.
The author also says that the most likely scenario is that the world fertility will rise again via a big return to such a religious commune. The author is not saying that the world will return to a state communist system, but to a small-scale religious commune. The author is not saying that people will return to a state communist system, but a small-scale religious group that is communal, family-oriented, etc.
So, the author is not saying that people will return to industrial state communism, but to a small-scale religious ""commune"" that is communal, family-oriented, etc. So, the author is not saying that the world will return to a state communist",497,500,300,0.1835,0.1862,0.9764,0.9304,0.9203,0.8762,-1.8333,3.25,0.277,0.3638,0.0155,0.0956,0.001,0.0606,0.5677,0.647,0.962,0.9101,0.3486394557823129,0.3362521891418564,0.4032697547683924,6,6,0.9715,0.8892,0.16297786720321933,0.126,0.20666666666666667,0.9193,0.5305,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Values Are Facts.txt,"Humanity has developed many rich and powerful tools for thinking about “facts”. Our estimates of facts are rich and deeply connected, allowing us to learn much about each fact from all the others. Furthermore, we have many kinds of specialists who deal with particular kinds of facts. However, we also care about “values”, and many say that our ways to think about facts just don’t work for values. They call attention to a “fact-value distinction.” And they develop whole separate ways to discuss values, and whole separate kinds of specialists, with value ways and specialists not much connected to their versions for facts. That seems a mistake to me, as “values” are just another kind of “facts”. They may be an unusually difficult kinds of facts to think about, and there may be specialized tools appropriate for them. But due to values being facts, we should be able to use their connections to other facts to learn much about them. Our estimates of values should be well connected with and integrated into our tools and views about other related facts. Just as we do with other facts. In “facts” I include everything we might say about the true arrangement of our physical world. Such as where each particle (e.g.,, electron, quark, or photon) is at each point in time. And its spin, momentum, etc. Not just at the present, but also the past and the future. Everywhere in spacetime, in fact. (And of course the shape of spacetime and the full quantum state of all of this.)
“Facts” also include all our observations and data. We have many standard tools for drawing inferences about our observations from physical arrangements, and vice versa, and also for estimating joint estimates regarding both. This topic area also includes “indexical” facts, about the mappings between observations and physical arrangements. “Facts” also include all counterfactuals about other facts. That is, what fact would instead have been true if other facts had been different than they actually are, were, or will be. Our best theories of how the world works usually tell us how to predict counterfactuals given actual facts. Finally, “facts” include fits to abstractions of all of the above. For example, “temperature at a point” is an abstraction, not implied by any exact particular arrangement of particles. But we have good standard ways to estimate that abstraction from such particle arrangements. Other physical abstractions include “molecules”, “planets”, “plasmas”, and “explosions”. And to the extent that we agree on how to fit such abstraction parameter estimates to actual arrangements, we can treat claims about these parameters as facts. “Creatures” are also abstractions, and so we have many facts about them, including their locations, movements, and actions. For example, “attack” is a creature abstraction that we can usually fit to physical arrangements, allowing us to talk about who will, did, or might attack whom.","Another quite useful creature abstraction is “expected utility”, whereby we describe a set of creature actions via a set of state-dependent utility numbers, and also a set of state-dependent belief numbers, beliefs which are updated over time with the info contained in the observations of that creature. Even for creatures whose actions only approximately satisfy the axions of expected utility theory, we can often find a useful best fit to their actions using this framework. And thus talk about such a creature’s utilities and beliefs that way. We have many other related decision frameworks that differ from expected utility theory. But almost all of them have analogies to info, beliefs, and utilities. Thus by fitting any of these decision abstractions to the actions of a particular creature, we can talk about the facts of a creature’s utilities, beliefs, and info. In this way there can be facts about each creature’s utilities, and thus about this one kind of “value.” Some creatures, like humans, often have thoughts and words not only about ordinary facts, but also about their and others’ actions. (Thoughts can also be included in the category actions.) Such thoughts can be about what they or others have done or will do, or about what they might do given counterfactual assumptions. These thoughts can be not just predictions about such actions, but also various attitudes toward those actions, such surprise, identity, wariness, or approval. Thought attitudes that fit some possible actions more than others can be combined with a decision framework to find the best fit utilities associated with such thoughts about actions. This produces facts about a different kind of creature “values”: the values associated with particular attitudes regarding some possible actions, instead of the values associated with actual actions. One especially useful abstraction about human attitudes regarding actions is “social norms”, whereby human communities encourage and discourage the actions of they and others, via approval or disapproval. Such norm-based action approval can also be combined with a decision framework to produce a third kind of “value”: normative value. What some community says that a creature “should” think or do. We thus have three kinds of “values” that can be described as “facts”: the values associated with actual (including future and counterfactual) actions, the values associated with thought attitudes toward actions, and the “normative” values associated with a community’s social norm disapproval of actions. If you say “no, I don’t mean any of those kinds of values, I mean true real values, but I have ways at all to connect these true values to these other kinds of values which are facts”, well then I’m just not sure what you could possibly mean. If you say “I’m talking about which acts we might agree are actually good”, that looks to me a lot like a particular kind of thought attitude toward such acts. Being facts, our views regarding all of these kinds of value facts should be integrated with our views regarding all the other connected facts. For","“Facts” also include all of our mathematical facts. For example, 2 + 2 = 4. And all of the mathematical facts that we have derived from physical facts. So, for example, if you know the exact position and momentum of all particles in the universe, you can in principle derive all mathematical facts, at least in theory.
But “values” are also facts. So, for example, that a human being is a good person. That a human being is a bad person. That a human being is a valuable person. That a human being is a valuable person in some sense. That a human being is not a valuable person. That a human being is not a valuable person in some sense. That a human being is a good or bad person in some sense. That a human being is a valuable or not valuable person in some sense. That a human being is a good or bad person, but not in the same sense. That a human being is a good or bad person in a certain way. That a human being is a good or bad person in a certain way, and in some other way. That a human being is a good or bad person in some way, and not in another. That a human being is a good or bad person in some way, but not in all ways. That a human being is a good or bad person in some way, but in another way is not. That a human being is a good or bad person in some way, and in another way is not. That a human being is a good or bad person in some way, but not in all. That a human being is a good or bad person in some way, but not in another. That a human being is a good or bad person in some way, but not in another. And so on. So, these are all facts about values. But they are facts. So, the same as facts about physical arrangements, they are facts that",478,500,347,0.3127,0.1662,0.9777,0.8263,0.6189,0.8501,9.2545,-2.2535,0.4274,0.3155,0.0492,0.042,0.0022,0.0056,0.4773,0.6972,0.9653,0.868,0.40512820512820513,0.40472175379426645,0.5468354430379747,6,1,0.9881,0.9695,0.15690376569037656,0.12,0.12968299711815562,0.8788,0.3599,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Fixing Academia Via Prediction Markets.txt,"When I first got into prediction markets twenty five years ago, I called them “idea futures”, and I focused on using them to reform how we deal with controversies in science and academia (see here, here, here, here). Lately I’ve focused on what I see as the much higher value application of advising decisions and reforming governance (see here, here, here, here). I’ve also talked a lot lately about what I see as the main social functions of academia (see here, here, here, here). Since prediction markets don’t much help to achieve these functions, I’m not optimistic about the demand for using prediction markets to reform academia. But periodically people do consider using prediction markets to reform academia, as did Andrew Gelman a few months ago. And a few days ago Scott Alexander, who I once praised for his understanding of prediction markets, posted a utopian proposal for using prediction markets to reform academia. These discussions suggest that I revisit the issue of how one might use prediction markets to reform academia, if in fact enough people cared enough about gaining accurate academic beliefs. So let me start by summarizing and critiquing Alexander’s proposal. Alexander proposes prediction markets where anyone can post any “theory” broadly conceived, like “grapes cure cancer.” (Key quotes below.) Winning payouts in such market suffer a roughly 10% tax to fund experiments to test their theories, and in addition some such markets are subsidized by science patron orgs like the NSF. Bettors in each market vote on representatives who then negotiate to pick someone to pay to test the bet-on theory. This tester, who must not have a strong position on the subject, publishes a detailed test design, at which point bettors could leave the market and avoid the test tax. “Everyone in the field” must make a public prediction on the test. Then the test is done, winners paid, and a new market set up for a new test of the same question. Somewhere along the line private hedge funds would also pay for academic work in order to learn where they should bet. That was the summary; here are some critiques. First, people willing to bet on theories are not a good source of revenue to pay for research. There aren’t many of them and they should in general be subsidized not taxed. You’d have to legally prohibit other markets to bet on these without the tax, and even then you’d get few takers. Second, Alexander says to subsidize markets the same way they’d be taxed, by adding money to the betting pot. But while this can work fine to cancel the penalty imposed by a tax, it does not offer an additional incentive to learn about the question. Any net subsidy could be taken by anyone who put money in the pot, regardless of their info efforts.","As I’ve discussed often before, the right way to subsidize info efforts for a speculative market is to subsidize a market maker to have a low bid-ask spread. Third, Alexander’s plan to have bettors vote to agree on a question tester seems quite unworkable to me. It would be expensive, rarely satisfy both sides, and seems easy to game by buying up bets just before the vote. More important, most interesting theories just don’t have very direct ways to test them, and most tests are of whole bundles of theories, not just one theory. Fourth, for most claim tests there is no obvious definition of “everyone in the field,” nor is it obvious that everyone should have opinion on those tests. Forcing a large group to all express a public opinion seems a huge cost with unclear benefits. OK, now let me review my proposal, the result of twenty five years of thinking about this. The market maker subsidy is a very general and robust mechanism by which research patrons can pay for accurate info on specified questions, at least when answers to those questions will eventually be known. It allows patrons to vary subsidies by questions, answers, time, and conditions. Of course this approach does require that such markets be legal, and it doesn’t do well at the main academic function of credentialing some folks as having the impressive academic-style mental features with which others like to associate. So only the customers of academia who mainly want accurate info would want to pay for this. And alas such customers seem rare today. For research patrons using this market-maker subsidy mechanism, their main issues are about which questions to subsidize how much when. One issue is topic. For example, how much does particle physics matter relative to anthropology? This mostly seems to be a matter of patron taste, though if the issue were what topics should be researched to best promote economic growth, decision markets might be used to set priorities. The biggest issue, I think, is abstraction vs. concreteness. At one extreme one can ask very specific questions like what will be the result of this very specific experiment or future empirical measurement. At the other extreme, one can ask very abstract questions like “do grapes cure cancer” or “is the universe infinite”. Very specific questions offer bettors the most protection against corruption in the judging process. Bettors need worry less about how a very specific question will be interpreted. However, subsidies of specific questions also target specific researchers pretty directly for funding. For example, subsidizing bets on the results of a very specific experiment mainly subsidizes the people doing that experiment. Also, since the interest of research patrons in very specific questions mainly results from their interest in more general questions, patrons should prefer to directly target the more general questions directly of interest to them. Fortunately, compared to other areas where one might apply prediction markets, academia offers especially high hopes for using abstract questions. This is","So, this is not a good way to fund research. Third, the system is too vague to be implemented. There’s no clear process for selecting the representative, or even for the bettors to agree on what a theory is. Alexander says that anyone can post any theory, but that seems unlikely to be practical. The market would be too chaotic to be useful. Fourth, the system would be too slow to be useful. Alexander says that everyone in the field must make a public prediction on the test. That would take a long time. Then the test is done, winners paid, and a new market set up for a the same question. It would take a long time to get to the truth, and during that time the market would be stuck in a state of uncertainty. Fifth, the system would be too expensive to be useful. The 10% tax is on payouts, so even if the market is small, that’s a lot of money. Also, the process of testing would be expensive. Sixth, the system would be too hard to implement. Alexander says that the representative is chosen by bettors. But how? The representative would have to be a neutral third party, but how would they be selected? How would the bettors choose them? It would be difficult to have a fair and efficient selection process. Seventh, the system would be too biased. Alexander says that the tester must not have a strong position on the subject. That is, the tester must not be a strong proponent of the theory, but the tester could be a strong opponent. The system would be biased in favor of the opposing side.

Robin Hanson,Explaining All The Weird UFO ‘Aliens’.txt,"Re gaining a better model of reality, we have three fundamental tasks: (A) collecting data, (B) elaborating theories that can explain data, and (C) finding matches between data and theory. While a half century ago (B) was king, now (A) is king; (C) has always been neglected. The topic of UFOs has long been taboo, and within the community willing to discuss them (B) and (C) remain taboo. There thus seem to be unusually high returns to doing task (C) regarding UFOs. And as I seem to be especially well-suited to that task, I feel a responsibility to try. So let me return again to the topic of matching UFO data and theory. Specifically to the task of finding the most believable way to explain UFO data via real things (not hallucinations or hoaxes) with amazing abilities cause by “aliens”. I’ve previously outlined the most plausible account I could find of UFOs as ordinary aliens, i.e., the kind with a planet of origin somewhere who travel here across ordinary space within light-speed limits. But I notice that people often invoke weirder ‘alien’ hypotheses. Such as that UFOs come from some ancient octopi-like civilization deep in our oceans. Or that UFOs result from future time-travelers. Or that UFOs come here from other dimensions in a more-than-four dimensional universe. So let me try to generalize my prior analysis to encompass such possibilities. The key common element is positing some other place out “there”, where “they” reside, and from which they can and do travel to “here”. This other place may be hard to “see” from here. The UFOs-as-aliens hypothesis posits that some of them have in fact traveled from there to here, and as a result have induced UFOs to appear here often recently, showing what are to us amazing abilities. (There have been maybe ~100K official UFO sighting reports.)
The fact that they can travel from there to here, but we cannot yet travel from here to there, combined with the amazing abilities UFOs display, lead us to describe them as more “advanced” than us. Plausibly due to their traveling down a long evolutionary growth path analogous to ours, but a path down which they went longer and further. How much further? I’ve said we could explain simple aliens behind UFOs via their being our panspermia siblings, in which case their home world is in our galaxy and they likely reached our tech level over a hundred million years ago. For the more general “aliens” case, it seems hard to imagine a common cause that could have induced the rise of both their and our civ in the last hundred thousand years. (In a universe 14 billion years old.)
Thus we should assume “they” reached something analogous to our tech level at least millions of years ago.","(Perhaps their abilities have since decayed in some ways.) This is a timescale on which they could have become completely artificial, with most everything in their world made in factories out of stuff dug up in mines, based on explicit designs. In which case there’s not really an important difference between “them” and “their UFO probes”. If they are not artificial, they likely collectively chosen that outcome, or have some very weird society we just don’t understand. There are a few more “facts” we’ll want our best theory of UFOs as aliens to explain. First, compared to familiar UFO activity showing amazing abilities, we don’t see remotely similar levels of nearby UFO-like colonization, development, or resource extraction activities. That is, the UFOs we see don’t seem to actually accomplish anything. Second, we don’t see any evidence of advanced civs, or any form of life actually, anywhere beyond Earth in the observable universe. (The size above which we can exclude active civs is large at far distances, but quite small nearby.) Third, while it should be quite feasible for an advanced civ, no UFOs have made themselves completely obvious to us. Yet while it should be well within the capabilities of an advanced civ to watch anything here while remaining completely invisible to us, a great many of them instead choose to be weakly visible. Yet these are mostly nearly minimally visible, revealing very little else about themselves besides their existence and a few amazing abilities. Over long historical timescales, most biological life, and most human culture, has tended to expand into new niches when such became available, grabbing relevant resources and occupying relevant spaces. So it is quite a striking fact that “they” have not done so at any noticeable scale, neither on or anywhere near Earth, not now nor for millions of years. Yet it could have taken only a tiny fraction of their civilization a tiny fraction of that time to completely colonize and rearrange our galaxy (and many others). We must thus conclude that either no part of them has any inclination whatsoever in that direction, or that their civ has coordinated around an anti-colonization “rule” that prevents such activity. (Such a coordination seems much harder to achieve if “they” are composed of many independent parts, suggesting “they” act as an unified whole re this issue.) Our civilization clearly does have many parts inclined in such colonization directions, and such parts seem likely to do so on a large scale in much less than a million years. Such behavior would seem to undermine “their” anti-colonization rule. And that right there gives them a reason to travel to see us. (They could of course have many other reasons.) Obviously, the simplest and most reliable way to achieve such an outcome would be for them to just destroy us. Or to conquer us and force us to obey them. Which they have not done. And thus we can conclude that they are reluctant to do such things; they would","But how much longer? How many more steps in the evolutionary path? The longer the path, the more likely that they could have a better grasp of what we now call “science”. Thus, if we think that their path is longer, the more likely that they could have a better grasp of science. But this is a bit of a paradox. If they are more advanced, they should be able to travel here from their home planet, but they are not able to travel here from here to there, which is the reverse. So, the more advanced they are, the less likely that they could have the knowledge and capability to travel here. So, how do we resolve this paradox? (This is a central issue.)
I think that the problem is that the term “advanced” is being used in a way that is not appropriate. We are using “advanced” to mean “more capable than us in some way, such as in science and technology”, but this is not the only way to be advanced. There are many kinds of advance, and we are not necessarily in the same kind of advance. Perhaps they are more advanced in a different way, such as in some form of knowledge or in some other domain. The problem is that we are using a single concept to describe two different things: one is the ability to travel between dimensions, and the other is the ability to manipulate matter. So, if they are more advanced in one way, they may not be more advanced in another. For instance, they could be more advanced in terms of their understanding of physics or in terms of their ability to travel between dimensions, but not in terms of their ability to travel from here to there. Thus, the paradox is not as paradoxical as it seems. This is the key insight.
So, what is the key insight here? The key insight is that we need to be careful about how we define “advanced.” The term can be misleading if we assume that being more advanced in one domain",466,500,350,0.2019,0.1317,0.9789,0.9397,0.9011,0.9085,2.0138,-1.6795,0.356,0.3799,0.0455,0.0464,0.0064,0.0054,0.6742,0.2883,0.9697,0.9625,0.40394973070017953,0.423728813559322,0.5522388059701493,6,5,0.9217,0.8428,0.16738197424892703,0.13,0.12285714285714286,0.8802,0.6284,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Mutual Admiration Societies.txt,"Recently I talked at an event for an investment fund that specializes in startups run by high school and college age kids. They told me that they prefer these to be STEM-type startups, as kids with other-type startup ideas tend more often to be crooks. I also noticed recently:
When intellectual A famously gets insight into topic X, it is quite rare for intellectuals interested in topics Y to say ""let's try to attract A to study Y!"". A might in fact wander into thinking on Y, but rarely because Y folks recruited him/her. An obvious explanation: most intellectuals care less about making progress on their topics, and more about being seen as the source of whatever progress is made. But then my friend Scott Aaronson told that this does happen in his field of theoretical computer science. Others told me this happens in some areas of math. These facts suggest to me that intellectual areas do actually vary in how healthy they are, at least in terms of how well people coordinate to promote progress. That is, in some areas people achieve equilibria that better promote progress, while in others they more pay lip service to progress while sitting in equilibria that push other efforts. This possibility has inspired me to outline a simple model of how intellectual norms could be more or less healthy, at least when peer review matters. But before describing that model, let’s review the basic game theory of peer review. Imagine that a set of reviewers decide which authored submissions are approved for valued slots, such as jobs, publications, grants, and reviewers. If a set of reviewers can coordinate and is completely free in its approval choices, then the obvious equilibrium is for a group of reviewers to form a “mutual admiration society” (MAS), which only approves submissions from its members. In a simple MAS equilibrium, there’s no need for MAS members to put any effort into their submissions beyond what it takes to identify themselves as MAS members following their equilibrium strategy. Now such a MAS equilibrium might be unstable in the face of a proposed new MAS which retains a majority of the prior MAS members but swaps out some old members for new members. But there’s no point in reviewers approving anyone not part of what they see as a prior or new MAS. If outside patrons or customers want an area run by peer review to not devolve into this sort of MAS equilibrium, they need to check that review criteria do not simply reduce to whether submissions are authored by MAS members. The more and stronger are other review criteria, then the more work submission authors will put into looking good according to such criteria, instead of just being MAS members. Or alternatively, patrons and customers might force one area to compete with another, evaluating each one in terms of some absolute measure of product or progress.","This can create incentives for area members to promote area norms that induce better area products or progress. The intellectual areas where I got most of my early grad-school-plus publications, and thus the areas most responsible for my tenure, were in economic theory. And I quickly learned that such areas are full of substantial MAS type effects. A typical research paper in economic theory picks some topic area, makes (very) roughly a dozen specific theoretical assumptions, and then proves roughly two to four results given those assumptions, results intended to be suggestive of econ activity in the paper’s topic area. Such papers also vary in how hard their math looks. When such a paper is submitted to a journal, peer reviewers are chosen who have published similar papers before. Reviewers must decide whether or not to recommend the submission, and what reasons to give for this choice. Usually they reject. If reviewers can find a major mistake in the math, they can reject for that reason. But reviewers are typically unwilling to put in the effort to find such mistakes, and most mistakes are minor. Sometimes reviewers reject saying that the math looks too easy, which is why authors don’t work as hard as they might to make their math easy to understand. And sometimes reviewers reject saying the topic is boring, which is why authors tend to stay close to reviewer-favored topics. But in economic theory, most rejections complain instead about the paper’s assumptions. For each of a paper’s roughly dozen assumption “slots”, there were ~2-4 possible assumptions one could have made at that point in the analysis, to fill that slot. For each result theorem, there were also a similar number of other results one could instead have sought. Thought results are heavily constrained by feasibility, as it is typically just not possible to prove anything re most possible results. Now consider a number of possible peer review norms that a review community could hold re each such assumption slot. A) One right answer - there is one specific right assumption to make in this slot; papers without it should be rejected. B) Any is okay - any assumption is okay in that slot, as long as the paper consistently works out its implications. C) Precedent required - an assumption is okay as long as a similar paper has made a similar assumption in that slot. D) Arbitrary is okay - reviewers are given discretion to accept or reject a paper on the basis of that assumption. Now we finally get to my model. Norms A,B,C might be more or less good at promoting progress, depending on how well the community can identify the better assumptions to make for that slot. But they don’t give much discretion to reviewers, whose publication recommendations are forced by context. So they don’t support MAS type equilibria. However norm D, which gives reviewers discretion, does allow reviewers to use MAS type reasons for their choice. After all, there are many ways to","This is similar to how in the academic world, one might compare different departments by their overall research output, or in the tech world, one might compare different startups by their total number of users. In such cases, the more competition between different areas, the more incentive for people in each area to actually make progress, not just to be part of a MAS. So, the model is: when intellectual areas are compared in absolute terms, then each area is incentivized to make progress, and when they are not, they are incentivized to form a MAS. The more areas that are compared in absolute terms, the more progress is incentivized across all areas. So, in a world where intellectual areas are not compared in absolute terms, and each is treated as a separate entity that is only compared to itself, then the more progress is incentivized by the existence of a MAS equilibrium. But that is the problem of the world we live in, where the only comparison is in relative terms. For example, if a person is a PhD student, then the only way to get a job is to be better than your peers. If you are in a field where people are only compared to their peers, then your field is more likely to be in a MAS equilibrium. This suggests that the only way to make intellectual areas more healthy is to have more absolute comparisons. So, the question is: How can we create more absolute comparisons in the world of intellectual areas? The answer is: by creating more areas where the same person can be a part of multiple absolute comparisons. For example, if a person is a PhD student in math, and also has a startup, and also has a part-time job in a different field, then this person is part of multiple absolute comparisons. The more such overlaps are there, the more progress is incentivized. So, the key is to create more cross-cutting and interdisciplinary work. The more cross-cutting and interdisciplinary work, the more people are part of multiple absolute",488,500,347,0.201,0.2157,0.9632,0.9425,0.7602,0.9428,-5.9352,-1.4167,0.3769,0.3497,0.025,0.0413,0.0032,0.0025,0.4414,0.5672,0.9776,0.9585,0.42463235294117646,0.39965095986038396,0.5128205128205128,7,7,0.973,0.9587,0.10245901639344263,0.13,0.13256484149855907,0.914,0.6365,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Debating Yudkowsky.txt,"On Wednesday I debated my ex-co-blogger Eliezer Yudkowsky at a private Jane Street Capital event (crude audio here, from 4:45; better video here, transcript here). I “won” in the sense of gaining more audience votes — the vote was 45-40 (him to me) before, and 32-33 after the debate. That makes me two for two, after my similar “win” over Bryan Caplan (42-10 before, 25-20 after). This probably says little about me, however, since contrarians usually “win” such debates. Our topic was: Compared to the farming and industrial revolutions, intelligence explosion first-movers will quickly control a much larger fraction of their new world. He was pro, I was con. We also debated this subject here on Overcoming Bias from June to December 2008. Let me now try to summarize my current position. The key issue is: how chunky and powerful are as-yet-undiscovered insights into the architecture of “thinking” in general (vs. on particular topics)? Assume there are many such insights, each requiring that brains be restructured to take advantage. (Ordinary humans couldn’t use them.) Also assume that the field of AI research reaches a key pivotal level of development. And at that point, imagine some AI research team discovers a powerful insight, and builds an AI with an architecture embodying it. Such an AI might then search for more such insights more efficiently than all other the AI research teams who share their results put together. This new fast AI might then use its advantage to find another powerful insight, restructure itself to take advantage of it, and so on until it was fantastically good at thinking in general. (Or if the first insight were super-powerful, it might jump to this level in one step.) How good? So good that it could greatly out-compete the entire rest of the world at the key task of learning the vast ocean of specific knowledge and insights useful for functioning in the world. So good that even though it started out knowing almost nothing, after a few weeks it knows more than the entire rest of the world put together. (Note that the advantages of silicon and self-modifiable code over biological brains do not count as relevant chunky architectural insights — they are available to all competing AI teams.)
In the debate, Eliezer gave six reasons to think very powerful brain architectural insights remain undiscovered:
Human mind abilities have a strong common IQ factor. Humans show many specific mental failings in reasoning. Humans have completely dominated their chimp siblings. Chimps can’t function as “scientists” in human society. “Science” was invented, allowing progress in diverse fields. AGI researchers focus on architectures, share little content. My responses:
Human mental abilities correlate across diverse tasks, but this can result from assortative mating, from task ability complementarities, or from an overall brain chemistry resource parameter. There is little reason to believe high IQ folks have a brain architecture feature that low IQ folks lack. Mind design must trade reliability and accuracy for speed and cost.","It is not clear that humans suffer greatly in typical real choices from their many biases. Yes future brains with lower compute costs will have higher reliability. But this is hardly a new architectural insight. The key human advantage was accumulatings insights via culture. Yes chimps have “culture,” but not enough. Humans had more precise and portable culture via language, and more use for it due to free hands and wider ranges. Culture has a threshold effect of giving only minor benefits until it has “enough” support. And in contrast to the farming and industry revolutions, where second movers still made big gains, chimps couldn’t copy or complement humans enough to gain from humans getting culture first. No big architectural advantages are needed to explain human domination. Low IQ humans also can’t function at top levels of human society, and we have no reason to believe they lack some special architecture that the high IQ have. Chimp inability to function at our society’s low levels, where their intelligence seems plenty sufficient, is explained by only a tiny fraction of animal species ever being domesticated. Most animals refuse to take our orders, even when they are plenty smart enough to understand them. The intellectual community called “science” required a sufficient scale of people, communication, and activity to be feasible. Similar behavior was probably tried many times before, but at insufficient scale. “Science” required no brain architecture changes. The vast majority of AI researchers focus on collecting and implementing small insights. The fact that a small community of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) researchers focus on architecture hardly says architecture gives huge gains. And academia discourages the large team projects needed to integrate a lot of content – it is hard to publish on small local changes to large projects. My five reasons to think powerful architectural insights are quite rare: The literature on economic, technical, and other innovation says most value comes from many small innovations – more useful and wider scope innovations are rarer, and usually require many small supporting innovations. “Intelligence” covers an extremely wide scope, basically all mental tasks. In general, innovations come from diverse users and builders, so the more users the better. Whatever appeared first in humans gave them no immediate gains in their ability to support a larger population, but only increased the growth rate of that ability. The same held in the farming and industry revolutions, the two other most disruptive events by far in human history. The key to all these changes seems to be better ways to spread innovations further faster. Thus any brain architectural gains must have focused mainly on spreading innovations. The usual lore among older artificial intelligence researchers is that new proposed architectural concepts are almost always some sort of rearranging of older architectural concepts. They see little new under the AI sun. The AI system Eliezer most respects for its promising architecture is Eurisko. Its author, Doug Lenat, concluded from it that our main obstacle is not architecture but","The “chimps” argument is only relevant if the chimp’s mind is not as good as the human’s. The “science” argument is only relevant if science is a universal method for finding knowledge. The AGI research community is very open and collaborative. The argument that such insights are “undiscovered” is not valid. (The debate was not a formal one, and I was not trying to “win” in a formal sense, just to express my views.)
I think the main problem with Eliezer's argument is that it assumes that a superintelligent AI would be able to find the next “chunky” insight. But this is a big assumption. I think the main problem with Eliezer's argument is that he has not shown that the “intelligence explosion” would be a quick one. (In other words, he hasn’t shown that the AI would be superintelligent in a short time — that would be the key to the whole argument.) Also, he didn’t address the possibility that the first AI might not be intelligent enough to find the next insight. That is, even if the AI is intelligent, maybe it’s not intelligent enough to find the next chunky insight. (In that case, the AI would be a regular AI, but not superintelligent.)

Robin Hanson,This is the Dream Time.txt,"Aboriginals believe in … [a] “dreamtime”, more real than reality itself. Whatever happens in the dreamtime establishes the values, symbols, and laws of Aboriginal society. … [It] is also often used to refer to an individual’s or group’s set of beliefs or spirituality. … It is a complex network of knowledge, faith, and practices that derive from stories of creation. Wikipedia. We will soon enter an era where most anyone can at any time talk directly with most anyone else who can talk. Cheap global talk and travel continue to tie our global economy and culture more closely together. But in the distant future, our descendants will probably have spread out across space, and redesigned their minds and bodies to explode Cambrian-style into a vast space of possible creatures. If they are free enough to choose where to go and what to become, our distant descendants will fragment into diverse local economies and cultures. Given a similar freedom of fertility, most of our distant descendants will also live near a subsistence level. Per-capita wealth has only been rising lately because income has grown faster than population. But if income only doubled every century, in a million years that would be a factor of 10^3000, which seems impossible to achieve with only the 10^70 atoms of our galaxy available by then. Yes we have seen a remarkable demographic transition, wherein richer nations have fewer kids, but we already see contrarian subgroups like Hutterites, Hmongs, or Mormons that grow much faster. So unless strong central controls prevent it, over the long run such groups will easily grow faster than the economy, making per person income drop to near subsistence levels. Even so, they will be basically happy in such a world. Our distant descendants will also likely have hit diminishing returns to discovery; by then most everything worth knowing will be known by many; truly new and important discoveries will be quite rare. Complete introspection will be feasible, and immortality will be available to the few who can afford it. Wild nature will be mostly gone, and universal coordination and destruction will both be far harder than today. So what will these distant descendants think of their ancestors? They will find much in common with our distant hunting ancestors, who also continued for ages at near subsistence level in a vast fragmented world with slow growth amid rare slow contact with strange distant cultures. While those ancestors were quite ignorant about their world, and immersed in a vast wild nature instead of a vast space of people, their behavior was still pretty well adapted to the world they lived in. While they suffered many misconceptions, those illusions rarely made them much worse off; their behavior was usually adaptive. When our distant descendants think about our era, however, differences will loom larger. Yes they will see that we were more like them in knowing more things, and in having less contact with a wild nature.","But our brief period of very rapid growth and discovery and our globally integrated economy and culture will be quite foreign to them. Yet even these differences will pale relative to one huge difference: our lives are far more dominated by consequential delusions: wildly false beliefs and non-adaptive values that matter. While our descendants may explore delusion-dominated virtual realities, they will well understand that such things cannot be real, and don’t much influence history. In contrast, we live in the brief but important “dreamtime” when delusions drove history. Our descendants will remember our era as the one where the human capacity to sincerely believe crazy non-adaptive things, and act on those beliefs, was dialed to the max. Why is our era so delusory? Our knowledge has been growing so fast, and bringing such radical changes, that many of us see anything as possible, so that nothing can really be labeled delusion. Rich folks like us have larger buffers of wealth to cushion our mistakes; we can live happily and long even while acting on crazy beliefs. We humans evolved to signal various features of ourselves to one another via delusions; we usually think that the various things we do to signal are done for other reasons. For example, we think we pay for docs to help our loved ones get well, rather than to show that we care. We think we do politics because we want to help our nation, rather than to signal our character and loyalty. We are overconfident in our abilities in order to convince others to have confidence in us, and so on. But while our ancestors’ delusions were well adapted to their situations, and so didn’t hurt them much, the same delusions are not nearly as adapted to our rapidly changing world; our signaling induced delusions hurt us more. Humans seem to have evolved to emphasize signaling more in good times than in bad. Since very few physical investments last very long, the main investments one can make in good times that last until bad times are allies and reputation. So we are built to, in good times, spend more time and energy on leisure, medicine, charity, morals, patriotism, and so on. Relative to our ancestors’ world, our whole era is one big very good time. Our minds were built with a near mode designed more for practical concrete reasoning about things up close, and a far mode designed more for presenting a good image to others via our abstract reasoning about things far away. But our minds must now deal with a much larger world where many relevant things are much further away, and abstract reasoning is more useful. So we rely more than did our ancestors on that abstract far mode capability. But since that far mode was tuned more for presenting a good image, it is much more tolerant of good-looking delusions. Tech now enables more exposure to mood-altering drugs and arts, and specialists make them into especially potent “super-stimuli.” Our ancestors","But they will also see that we had more contact with other people. Our ancestors were in a world of wild nature, but we were in a world of other people. The distant descendants will thus think of us as a species that was in a transitional phase between the two worlds. In our era, we were still in a world of people, but we were starting to get a glimpse of the world of wild nature. They will see us as a species that was still in the process of becoming. But if our descendants are not in a world of wild nature, and are in a world of people, then they will not see us as a species that was in a process of becoming. They will instead see us as a species that was in a process of becoming something else. We were not going to become a species of people. We were going to become a species of people, but we were also going to become a species of wild nature. The distant descendants will think that we were in a process of becoming two things at once. We were not going to become a species of people, or a species of wild nature. We were going to become both. Our ancestors were a species of wild nature, and our descendants will be a species of people. We were a species of wild nature, but we were also going to become a species of people. The future of humanity is not just a continuation of our present trajectory, but a bifurcation into two directions. The problem with this argument is that it seems to assume that our descendants will be more advanced than us, and that they will be people, not wild nature. But what if our descendants are not more advanced than us, but instead are something else?

Robin Hanson,Fertility Fall From Selection Neglect.txt,"In the novel Pot Luck by Zola, a middle class woman in 1862 explains why she had only one kid, Marie, & wants Marie to have only one kid:
‘Children, you know, are such a burden.’
‘Indeed they are,’ remarked Madame Vuillaume. ‘If we’d had another one we would never have been able to make ends meet. So remember, Jules, what I made you promise when I gave you our Marie: one child and no more, or else we’ll fall out. It’s only the working classes that have children as hens lay eggs, regardless of what it’ll cost them. It’s true, they turn them loose into the street like so many flocks of sheep. I must say it makes me quite sick.’
Marie gets pregnant again, and then her mom disowns her. Selection effects are often powerful, simple, and yet neglected. Neglect of selection effects arguably accounts for people mistakenly overestimating investment fund returns, accepting typical claims of significantly significant empirical estimates, preferring views for which we seek confirming but not disconfirming evidence, thinking that a beautiful and congenial universe must have a creator, thinking that seeing an empty universe implies that little of it by volume is now visibly changed by aliens, judging most winners of recent wars to have been on the more morally virtuous side, seeing docs of young patients who get better as effective, and thinking that schools make students into better workers. In my life I am personally struck by how often I have been truly surprised to learn of selection arguments. Even though they tend to be quite simple and persuasive, many just didn’t occur to me before I was told of them. Selection neglect thus seems to me one of our most plausible candidates for a cognitive mistake that can greatly distort our thoughts and actions. It seems that evolution just didn’t bequeath our minds with strong natural abilities to notice and correct for selection effects. This each individual must learn anew, and usually fails to learn. Our world fertility decline looks pretty clearly biologically maladaptive, and so to explain it we need to posit some sort of evolutionary mistake, showing how our ancestors could have plausibly evolved a habit that then went so very wrong in our unusual recent world. I’ve previously suggested that, for our ancestors who had a shot at they or their kids becoming high-fertility kings or queens, it made sense to invest less in current fertility and more in acquiring more better status markers. While this heuristic should have triggered on having high relative status, it might have actually triggered on high absolute wealth, as wealth was a consistent sign of status and median society wealth rarely varied much before the last few centuries. Thus plausibly explaining why we now all cut fertility as we all have gotten rich. Let me now instead suggest a different mistake theory to explain our fertility fall, in fact a selection neglect mistake theory.","This theory starts by accepting Henrich and Gil-White’s story that in humans prestige functions to focus our learning and emulation efforts; we prefer to copy the beliefs and behaviors of those who seem successful overall as indicated by many features, including their success at getting others to copy them. Most of the time this works pretty well, as the behaviors that tend to be found more often among the more successful do in fact tend to promote success, relative to alternative behaviors. This is, in fact a big Secret to Our Success, in the words of Henrich’s popular book title. But sometimes selection effects can make behaviors appear more often among those who seem more successful, even when such behaviors do not on average cause more relevant success. For example, a survey of business people who went far from low rags to great riches should find that at some point most of them took big risks, and did so repeatedly. Compared to others, the top tail of the richest newly-rich folks will more often have big risk-taking as part of their story. Yet on average most business folks would be worse off if they took such enormous risks. Thus business folks who just naively emulate this particular behavior of the most successful business folk around them will be making a selection neglect mistake. Similarly, hopeful junior academics tend to notice that, earlier in their careers, the most successful academics around them pursued unusual and distinctive research agendas. At least the stories told about such successful academics tend to emphasize such moves, even if they weren’t representative. Junior academics might then be fooled by selection neglect into taking such big risks, not realizing that most modestly successful academics got there via pretty boring and low-risk research. Such selection neglect can also distort the fertility choices of parents with substantial capital to either bequeath directly to their kids, or to invest in promoting their kids’ success. When such parents choose to have fewer kids, they can allocate more capital to each kid, and then those kids will tend to be individually more rich or successful. So if people look at the more successful individuals around them, and ask what their relatively rich parents did to help make them successful, they will tend to see stories of parents who had fewer kids. Now if observers had instead considered a cohort of ancestors, and asked which of them had the most great grandkids or later descendants, they’d probably find less success among the ancestors who chose to have fewer kids. So this selection neglect mistake theory requires that observers look less at this, but instead focus on the behaviors of the parents of the most successful kids. Which are typically easier to see. So if humans evolved a habit of trying to copy the behaviors of their most successful associates, and then found that the parents of rich successful folks tended to be rich and to choose fewer kids, people might have also learned","That is, our ancestors were not so much interested in status, but in the more basic and universal need to have a family. So the idea is that, for our ancestors, when they thought about their children, they were not thinking about the social status of their children, but about the family as a whole. So the idea is that the family is a unit that is not just about the children, but about the parents and the children. So, in other words, the parents are not just looking out for the children, but also for the family as a whole. So, for example, when our ancestors were deciding to have children, they were considering the future of the family unit, and not just the future of their children. So, when our ancestors thought about the future, they were thinking about the family as a unit, not just the children. So, the idea is that we should think of the family as a unit, and not just as a set of children. Therefore, the selection effect here is that when we think of the children, we are not thinking about the family as a unit, and thus, we are not taking into account the fact that the family as a unit is not just about the children, but about the parents as well. Therefore, the selection effect is that we are not taking into account the fact that the family is a unit, and thus, we are not taking into account the fact that the world is not just about children, but about the family as a whole. Therefore, the selection effect is that we are not taking into account the fact that the family is a unit, and thus, we are not taking into account the fact that the world is not just about children, but about the family as a whole. So, in other words, the selection effect is that we are not taking into account the fact that the family is a unit, and thus, we are not taking into account the fact that the world is not just about children",492,500,354,0.1248,0.0981,0.946,0.8457,0.8858,0.7768,3.2222,7.1818,0.3085,0.2721,0.0353,0.0145,0.0045,0.0023,0.4264,0.4131,0.9536,0.9161,0.40425531914893614,0.42105263157894735,0.5925,4,3,0.9918,0.9496,0.10772357723577236,0.092,0.12994350282485875,0.7459,0.3347,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,The Master and His Emissary.txt,"I had many reasons to want to read Iain McGilchrist’s 2009 book The Master and His Emissary. Its an ambitious big-picture book, by a smart knowledgeable polymath. I love that sort of book. I’ve been meaning to learn more about brain structure, and this book talks a lot about that. I’ve been wanting to read more literary-based critics of economics, and of sci/tech more generally. I’m interested in critiques of civilization suggesting that people were better off in less modern worlds. This video gives an easy to watch book summary:
McGilchrist has many strong opinions on what is good and bad in the world, and on where civilization has gone wrong in history. What he mainly does in his book is to organize these opinions around a core distinction: the left vs right split in our brains. In sum: while we need both left and right brain style thinking, civilization today has gone way too far in emphasizing left styles, and that’s the main thing that’s wrong with the world today. McGilchrist maps this core left-right brain distinction onto many dozens of other distinctions, and in each case he says we need more of the right version and less of the left. He doesn’t really argue much for why right versions are better (on the margin); he mostly sees that as obvious. So what his book mainly does is help people who agree with his values organize their thinking around a single key idea: right brains are better than left. Here is McGilchrist’s key concept of what distinguishes left from right brain reasoning:
There is a need to focus attention narrowly and with precision, as a bird, for example, needs to focus a grain of corn that it must eat, in order to pick it out from, say, the pieces of grit on which it lies. At the same time there is a need for open attention, as wide as possible, to guard against a possible predator. … Not only are these two different exercises that need to be carried on simultaneously, they are two quite different kinds of exercise, requiring not just that attention should be divided, but that it should be of two distinct types at once. (p.25)
The left brain emphasizes narrow focus tasks, while the right brain emphasizes broad focus tasks. As a result, McGilchrist says that compared to the left brain, the right emphasizes: surprising over predictable, implicit over explicit, context over particulars, unknown over known, intuition over logic and rationality, natural over artificial, metaphorical over literal, connoting over denoting, real over hypothetical, ‘aha!’ over anticipated, hard over easy to verbalize knowledge, non-verbal over verbal communication, and reacting to over controlling. These 13 distinctions all seem to me to be connected directly enough to the core narrow versus broad focus distinction. And I found the question of why the brain is split into two only-weakly-disconnected sections doing these two things intriguing enough that I wrote a post on it a month ago.","However, McGilchrist goes on to connect a great many more distinctions onto this left-right distinction. (I count at least 50 more.) And many reviewers of his book have noted that in doing so he goes far beyond neuroscience consensus, and is often quite speculative. At various points, he says that the right brain also focuses more on: wholes over parts, life over tools and machines, doubt over confidence, connected over isolated, dynamic over static, deep 3D over flat views, long over short term, data over theory, instances over categories, music over talk, personal over impersonal, justice and aesthetics and over utility and practicality, completeness over consistency, blurry over clear concepts, embodied over disembodied, real over virtual, informal over bureaucratic relations, what over how, human over inhuman, meaningful over meaningless, usual over bizarre, empathy over selfishness, emotional over unemotional understanding, reading eyes over reading mouths, spontaneous over forced feelings, wariness over optimism, melancholy over happiness, cooperation over competition, color green over red, number relations over absolutes, semantics over syntax, minor key over major key, honesty over denial and confabulation, feeling of loss over of winning, self- over other- awareness, art over practicality, funny over serious, creative over uncreative, feelings of awe over feelings of mastery, love over exploitation of nature, non-sequential over sequential, non-binary over either-or, understanding via intuitive leaps of wholes over building up argument parts, acting without purpose over with a purpose, sensitive to over indifferent to discrepancies, real sex over pornography, rituals and metaphor over literal texts in religion, love and longing over desire and acquisition, and curves over lines. In each case, McGilchrist seems to prefer the right side more, in the sense that he wants to see more of it and less of the left side. And for most of them, he sees the arc of history as bending left, when it should bend right. By so consistently valuing what he claims to be the right-brain sider in these distinctions, McGilchrist seems to be saying that favoring right-brain thinking is his core personal value, the source of all these other values. Now I do find it plausible that the rise of civilization has in fact induced an emphasis on left-brain style thinking. Instead of watching for danger in a wild hard-to-understand nature, we now live in safer more artificial worlds that we better understand. And so we now less often watch for dangerous surprises and more often calculate what to do based on reliable-enough theories of how our worlds work. But this seems to me a natural and appropriate response to the rise of civilization. So why does McGilchrist see these changes as bad? The following quotes may help you see his perspective: It is the Industrial Revolution which enabled the left hemisphere to make its most audacious assault yet on the right hemisphere. … The mechanical production of goods ensured a world in which the members of a class were not just approximate fits … [but] truly identical: equal, interchangeable members of their category. …","But since I haven’t read the book yet, I’m not sure I understand all of the details. But here’s a key part of the book’s message that I found interesting:
The left brain is the brain that is dominant in our modern civilization. We have built our systems of governance, economy, education, science, and technology on the left brain. This is not just because the left brain is more active in our modern world, but also because of the way our civilization has emphasized the left brain over the right. The right brain is the more intuitive, holistic, and creative side of the brain. It is the brain that is more attuned to the whole and to the mystery of the world. The right brain is the one that is more sensitive to the emotional, the spiritual, the artistic, and the intuitive. It is the brain that is more open to the unknown, and more willing to embrace the mystery of life. In contrast, the left brain is more analytical, logical, and linear. It is the brain that is more concerned with control, prediction, and mastery over the world. It is the brain that is more interested in the known, the precise, and the measurable. (p.48)
The problem is that the left brain is now dominant, and the right brain is being ignored. McGilchrist argues that this imbalance has caused a lot of problems in the modern world. He says that the left brain’s emphasis on control, prediction, and mastery has led to a lot of problems in the modern world. He says that the left brain’s focus on the known and the precise has led to a lot of problems in the modern world. He also says that the left brain’s emphasis on logic and rationality has led to a lot of problems in the modern world. So he is arguing that we need to be more balanced in our thinking, and that we need to give more attention to the right brain.

Robin Hanson,Our Big Oops.txt,"Humanity has a huge problem, of which few are aware. Consider an analogy. Your ability to keep a car on a road while driving depends on key driving parameters staying within acceptable ranges. These parameters include your car speed, how curvy and bumpy is your road, and noise and delay levels in the key processes by which: (a) you look ahead to see the road, (b) you judge how much to move your steering wheel and accelerator controls, (c) you move your arms and legs to adjust those controls, (d) those controls couple to move your car wheels and engine, and (e) your engine-driven car wheels holds traction with the road. If these parameters get overall bad enough, you should expect your car to drift off the road and crash. Humanity’s superpower is just natural selection, applied to our unique abilities to reliably copy each other’s behaviors. For this cultural evolution process to keep humanity on its road of progress, we need its key driving parameters to similarly stay good enough. In this case, we need sufficient variety and selection pressures regarding our behaviors, relative to our rates of environmental change and internal cultural drift. Without good parameters, culture should drift into maladaption. Three hundred years ago, this parameter comparison looked pretty good at all cultural levels. Our environment changed slowly, as we doubled in population roughly every thousand years. And we had great variety in hundreds of thousands of largely-independent reluctant-to-change peasant cultures, cultures that frequently faced strong selection pressures of war, famine, and pandemics. When one such culture drifted off of the adaptive road, it was quickly replaced by neighbors. Today, our parameters still look good re the types of behaviors that are easy to vary individually; we have record rates of innovation in tech and business practices. But they look more worrisome re the cultural norms and game-theory-equilibria parameters that are hard to change individually, culturally-set features analogous to the harder-to-evolve DNA-set features that define biological species, as compared to DNA-set features that can vary easily within such species. (Biology DNA evolves faster with more smaller species, as that better promotes these more important species-defining features.) I’ll call these features “culture”. For well over a century now, our environment has changed quite fast, with the world economy doubling faster than every twenty years. Our greatest heroes have been cultural activists who push for big culture changes mostly unrelated to adaptive pressures, thus causing high rates of cultural drift. Our hundreds of thousands of diverse peasant cultures were first crushed into a few hundred national cultures, and then into a single dominant elite world monoculture, vastly reducing variety. And our great health, wealth, and peace have greatly reduced selection pressures; cultures hardly ever die anymore. Differential fertility, which takes centuries to impose its discipline, is our main remaining cultural selection pressure.","Together these trends suggest that today the “cultural” features of our behaviors—i.e., the features strongly shaped by conformity pressures imposed by our shared elite monoculture and thus hard to vary within that monoculture—may have long been drifting into maladaptation. This seems most plausible regarding fertility, but also seems believable re increasing mental illness and drug addiction, legal over-complexity, over-regulation of commerce, over-spending on education and medicine, and many other problematic social trends. Yes, behavior is still selected to copy world elites, but alas the status markers that drive this process also seem to be drifting into maladaption. This cultural drift into maladaption can work via both unpredictable random walks away from once adaptive behaviors, and also via predictable drifts, wherein we revert to a human nature from which cultural selection had previously moved us away. For example, culture may have moved us away from natural human laziness, selfishness, decadence, and present-orientation. Furthermore, we may be reverting to forager styles, after the relaxation of selection pressures that had turned foragers into farmers. Becoming more forager-like is plausibly giving us more travel, leisure, democracy, and promiscuity, and less war, dominance, self-control, work, religion, and fertility. A straightforward projection of current trends into the coming centuries plausibly results in the world population and economy soon peaking and then declining, and innovation then grinding to a halt. Today’s small insular fertile religious subcultures like the Amish or Haredim, who have been doubling every twenty years, would in a few centuries come to dominate the world, much like the Christians took over the Roman Empire by doubling this fast for three centuries. At which point they’d create new rich healthy peaceful world monocultures full of cultural activists, which again succumb to cultural drift. You might think you don’t care if your behavior is maladaptive, if it achieves other goals. But maladaptive lineages go away. So if you want to achieve anything via your long-term lineage, you want it to be adaptive, so it can be there to do other things. Solving the problem of cultural drift seems very hard, apparently requiring either drastic changes to our cultural evolution parameter values, to let natural selection again drive us to adaptive cultures, or even larger changes to this whole system, changes so large as to constitute an “end of culture”, after which culture is driven by substantially by something other than simple natural selection. Both approaches seem quite hard to accomplish, and even then only at great costs. Yet the cost of failing to solve it is increasing cultural dysfunction, a headwind that may not be outweighed by innovation in tech and business practices. That is, our world civilization might actually decline. On parameter changes, fragmenting the world into many small insular groups with deep cultural differences would help, but seems quite hard to enforce, and comes at a great cost to innovation. Greatly reviving poverty, war and disease might also help, but at obviously severe costs. High human fertility might help revive competition, and poverty. And","We are now in a state where the parameters look bad. The main problem is that the variety in the culture (the diversity of our norms, values, and game-theory equilibria) is too low, and the selection pressure is too low. Thus, our culture is not adapting fast enough. In this case, we are in danger of drifting off the road of progress. The key is to increase the selection pressure, by increasing the diversity of norms and values, or by increasing the diversity of the culture. But how? We are stuck with the same set of culture values and norms, and the same set of cultural groups, as before. So we have to change our culture in ways that make the existing culture more sensitive to change. The only way to increase selection pressure is to make the system more sensitive to change. The key is to make the system more sensitive to change. This is a hard task, and it requires some rethinking. We need to change the way we think about the culture, and the way we think about the problem of cultural change. What is culture? What is the role of culture in our lives? How do we think about culture as a system? We need to change our thinking. We need to think of culture as a system of systems, where each system is a subculture. And we need to think of culture as a system that is in a state of constant flux, with many interdependent subsystems, each of which is in a state of flux. We need to think of culture as a system that is constantly adapting, not just in the sense of changing, but in the sense of adjusting to new conditions and maintaining stability. We need to think of culture as a complex adaptive system, similar to a living organism. In this way, we can begin to understand the analogy between the car and the driver. Just as a car must maintain balance between its speed, road conditions, and control systems, so too must culture maintain balance between its",473,500,348,0.2193,0.1915,0.9675,0.8905,0.9945,0.7152,0.1225,-6.3182,0.315,0.3235,0.0388,0.0464,0.0073,0.0084,0.6059,0.6518,0.9659,0.945,0.33636363636363636,0.3310225303292894,0.5,6,8,0.9497,0.9382,0.17124735729386892,0.152,0.12931034482758622,0.8984,0.538,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,How Far To Grabby Aliens_ Part 2..txt,"In my last post, I recommended these assumptions:
It is worth knowing how far to grabby alien civs (GCs), even if that doesn’t tell about other alien types. Try-try parts of the great filter alone make it unlikely for any one small volume to birth an GC in 14 billion years. We can roughly estimate GC expansion speed, and the number of hard try-try steps in the great filter. Earth is not now within the sphere of control of an GC. Earth is at risk of birthing an GC soon, making today’s date a sample from GC time origin distribution. I tried to explain how these assumptions can allow us to estimate how far away are GC. And I promised to give more math details in my next post post. This is that next post. First, I promised to elaborate on how well tn works as the chance that a small volume will birth a GC at time t. The simplest model is that eternal oases like Earth are all born at some t=0, and last forever. Each oasis must pass through a great filter, i.e., a sequence of hard steps, from simple dead matter to simple life to complex life, etc., ending at a GC birth. For each hard step, there’s a (different) constant chance per unit time to make it to the next step, a chance so low that the expected time for each step is much less than t. In this case, the chance of GC birth per unit time in a small volume is tn, with n = h-1, where h is the number of hard steps. If there are many oases in a small volume with varying difficulty, their chances still add up to the same tn dependence as long as they all have the same number of hard steps between dead matter an a GC. If there are try-once steps in the great filter, steps where an oasis can fail but which don’t take much time, that just reduces the constant in front of tn, without changing the tn dependence. If there are also easy steps in this filter, steps that take expected time much less than t, these just add a constant delay, moving the t=0 point in time. We can accommodate other fixed delays in the same way. We have so far assumed that, one the prior steps have happened, the chance of each step happening is constant per unit time. But we can also generalize to the case where this step chance per time is a power law tm , with t the time since the last step was achieved, and with a different mi for each step i. In this case, h = Σi (1+mi). These step powers m can be negative, or fractional. Instead of having the oases all turn on at some t=0, oases like Earth with a chance tn can instead be born at a constant rate per unit time after some t=0.","It turns out that the integrated chance across all such oases of birthing a GC at time t is again proportional to tn, with again n = h-1. A more elaborate model would consider the actually distribution of star masses, which have a CDF that goes as m-1.5, and the actual distribution of stellar lifetime L per mass m, which has a CDF that goes as m-3. Assuming that stars of all masses are created at the same constant rate, but that each star drops out of the distribution when it reaches its lifetime, we still get that the chance of GC birth per unit time goes as tn, except that now n = h-1.5. Thus the tn time dependence seems a decent approximation in more complex cases, even if the exact value of n varies with details. Okay, now lets get back to this diagram I showed in my last post: If the GC expansion speed is constant in conformal time (a reasonable approximation for small civ spatial separations), and if the civ origin time x that shapes the diagram has rank r in this civ origin time distribution, then x,r should satisfy: ((1-r)/r) ∫0x tn dt = ∫x1 tn (1 – ((t-x)D/(1-x))) dt.Here D is the space dimension. D = 3 is appropriate on the largest and the small many-star scales, but D = 2 across galaxy disks, and D = 1 in filaments of galaxies. This equation can be solved numerically. The ratio of the time from an GC origin til that GC directly meets aliens, relative to universe age at civ origin, is (1-x)/x, and is shown in this table: The x-axis here is the power n in tn, and the y-axis is shown logarithmically. As you can see, aliens can be close in the sense that the time to reach aliens is much smaller than is the time it takes to birth the GC. This time til meet is also smaller for higher powers and for more spatial dimensions. Note that these meet-to-origin time ratios don’t depend on the GC expansion speed. As I discussed in my last post, this model suggests that spatial distances between GC origins double if either the median GC origin time doubles, or if the expansion speed doubles. The lower is the expansion speed relative to the speed of light, the better a chance a civ has of seeing an approaching GC before meeting them directly. (Note that we only need a GC expansion speed estimate to get distributions over how many GCs each can see at its origin, and how easy they are to see. We don’t need speeds to estimate how long til meet aliens.) To get more realistic estimates, I also made a quick Excel-based sim for a one dimensional universe. (And I am happy to get help making better sims, such as in higher dimensions.) I randomly picked 1000 candidate GC origins (x,t), with x drawn uniformly in [0,1], and t drawn proportional to tn in","The problem of the time of the first GC birth in the universe is then the same as the problem of the time of the first success in a Poisson process with rate λ = (total number of oases) * tn, with n the number of steps. The time of the first GC birth is then a random variable T, with the probability density function (PDF) given by the exponential distribution: P(T) = λe^{-λt}. The expected value of T is 1/λ, and the variance is 1/λ². But wait, that is the case where the probability of success is a constant per unit time, and the process is memoryless. However, in the model above, the probability of success is tn, not a constant. So, the Poisson process assumption is not correct. So, we need to re-derive the PDF for the time of the first GC birth in this model. To do this, we need to consider the time of the first GC birth in a Poisson process with rate λ(t), where λ(t) = total number of oases * t^n. This is a non-homogeneous Poisson process. The PDF for the time of the first event in a non-homogeneous Poisson process is given by P(T) = λ(t) e^{-∫₀ᵗ λ(t') dt'} / ∫₀^∞ λ(t') e^{-∫₀^t λ(t') dt'} dt'}. Wait, but I'm not sure about this.

Robin Hanson,Who Should Be Our “Adults”_.txt,"Adult: “a mature, fully developed person. An adult has reached the age when they are legally responsible for their actions.”
“to attend to the ordinary tasks required of a responsible adult” “children should be accompanied by an adult” “responsibility, independent decision-making, and financial independence”
Mature: “fully grown physically” “developed mentally and emotionally and behave in a responsible way” “a lot of careful thought”
Responsible: “liable to be called to account” “able to answer for one’s conduct and obligations; trustworthy” “involving important duties, independent decision-making, or control over others.”
The usual concept of “adult” combines both a style in a role, “mature, responsible, independent”, and a description of who we let fill that role, “fully grown human”. In this post I want to reconsider who should fill that role. The main role of an “adult” is to think carefully about what to do, and then do it reliably, with action choices that account well for their effects on others. That is, an adult has autonomy, self-control, and intelligence to make choices well and reliably, but also faces social incentives adequate to make them play well with others. Or at least play similarly well to the other available adults. Adults can be relied on to do the important things than need doing, and yet can be given great autonomy to decide what to do how and why. A key subsidiary adult role is to manage “dependents” who are not up to filling this role. Such as children, animals, machines, the mentally ill, and the infirm. Not all adults need take this role, but those who do take this role must be adults. We match each such dependent to an adult “guardian”, allow that guardian to limit dependent behavior, and hold that guardian responsible for such behavior. In order to limit guardian mistreatment of dependents, sufficiently able dependents may be allowed to choose their guardians,
The prototype for this relation is that between human parents and their children. Parents limit their children, and are responsible for them to outsiders. Compared to their children, parents are more free to choose their actions and relations, are more held responsible for their actions, and are more trusted to do important things. A common “libertarian” vision is to treat all fully grown humans as “adults” in this sense. But in fact such humans have usually not been full trusted, free, or responsible. Among foragers, the band as a whole, discussing together, was more of an “adult”, trusted to limit the behavior of band members. Later on, during the farmer/herder era, family clans were more the “adults”, held responsible for member behavior and able to limit those individuals. Larger nations and empires have also been treated by the world as “adults”, free to choose and to be destroyed. And at times such units have decided to limit the freedoms of particular family clans, treating them as less than fully adult.","Such higher level “adult” social units have at times treated particular fully grown humans as also “adult”, judging them to be sufficiently reliable and responsible to be treated in that way. But many other fully grown humans have been treated more as dependents. And the usual rule has been that such dependents must be associated with particular controlling adults who were more reliable and could be more held more responsible. The industrial revolution was primarily driven by the rise of new larger orgs, such as for-profits, non-profits, and government agencies. (Science & tech were side effects of those new orgs.) And once such orgs became available, we soon came to treat them as the main “adults” of our world. Such orgs are arguably just smarter and more thoughtful and reliable than individual humans. They are now trusted to manage our most important activities, and are allowed to make deals and relations with each other quite freely, with almost no regulations. Today we do not treat most fully grown humans as fully “adult”; we instead require each such human to pair up with a nation-state. Nation-states then limit the choices of their fully grown human members, and are held responsible by other nations-states for the actions of such members. We also usually support a norm that humans should be free to switch nations, if the new nation will take them. Nations don’t always play well with each other, but no other orgs at that level can force them to behave better. However, I propose that we seriously consider instead treating smaller organizations (for-profits and non-profits) as the main responsible “adults” with which we pair each fully grown human. These smaller orgs are arguably on average even smarter, more thoughtful, and more reliable than are nations, they arguably play better with each other, and we are more willing and able to hold them strictly responsible. Furthermore, these are the orgs that we actually trust to do most of our important activities. Competition between such orgs is what mainly ensures adaptation and innovation in our world, far more than does competition between nation-states. And allowing humans to choose between these as their adults gives them far more effective choice than when choosing between nations. Today employers are in part treated as “adults” relative to their employees. And requiring each fully grown human to pair up with a sufficiently responsible firm is the essence of my “vouching” proposal for criminal law reform. The main formal requirement to be a voucher is having enough money to pay client fines, which makes such an org much easier to hold responsible for they and client actions. In addition, I expect most to be for-profit firms, and thus smarter and more reliable than are most fully-grown humans. With vouchers responsible for individual behavior, and able to regulate that behavior, we’d have less need for government regulation to limit individual behavior. Compared to themselves, children see their parents taking on more important roles in the world, being held more","The more powerful, the more free they are. But when they are in a weaker position, they are treated as less than adults.
The idea of a “child” is not just a stage of life, but a social role, and the idea of “childhood” is not just a time in life, but a social condition, or a condition of dependency. In many societies, people have been given the role of child at a young age, and kept in that role until they are given the role of adult. A child is not just someone who is not mature, but someone who is not yet entrusted with the role of adult, and is not yet trusted to be responsible. So the idea of child is not just about being young, but about being untrusted. A child is not a person, but a social role, and a person is not a child, but is an adult. The idea of adulthood is not about being old, but about being trusted. So if someone is in the role of child, they are not an adult, and if someone is in the role of adult, they are an adult. The role of adult is not something that can be achieved, but something that is given. It is not about age, but about trust. The role of adult is not a status, but a function, a role, a responsibility. So, in the context of the discussion, the term ""adult"" is not about being a certain age, but about being trusted to take on the role of adult. This is a radical departure from the usual understanding of the term. It is a way of thinking that is not just about age, but about trust and responsibility.
This is a very interesting and thought-provoking post. It challenges the conventional understanding of ""adult"" by emphasizing trust and responsibility rather than age. It suggests that the role of an adult is not about being old, but about being trusted to take on the role of adult. This is a different",482,500,341,0.3758,0.3457,0.953,0.8471,0.9964,0.8131,0.081,-4.1364,0.4636,0.3509,0.0809,0.0467,0.0101,0.0082,0.6311,0.7073,0.968,0.9065,0.38747884940778343,0.4288224956063269,0.5518987341772152,4,4,0.9409,0.9875,0.14522821576763487,0.122,0.1495601173020528,0.8457,0.5941,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Earth_ A Status Report.txt,"In a universe that is (so far) almost entirely dead, we find ourselves to be on a rare planet full not only of life, but now also of human-level intelligent self-aware creatures. This makes our planet a roughly a once-per-million-galaxy rarity, and if we ever get grabby we can expect to meet other grabby aliens in roughly a billion years. We see that our world, our minds, and our preferences have been shaped by at least four billions years of natural selection. And we see that evolution going especially fast lately, as we humans pioneer many powerful new innovations. Our latest big thing: larger scale organizations, which have induced our current brief dreamtime, wherein we are unusually rich. For preferences, evolution has given us humans a mix of (a) some robust general preferences, like wanting to be respected and rich, (b) some less robust but deeply embedded preferences, like preferring certain human body shapes, and (c) some less robust but cultural plastic preferences, such as which particular things each culture finds more impressive. My main reaction to all this is to feel grateful to be a living intelligent creature, who is compatible enough with his world to often get what he wants. Especially to be living in such a rich era. I accept that I and my descendants will long continue to compete (in part by cooperating of course), and that as the world changes evolution will continue to change my descendants, including as needed their values. Many see this situation quite differently from me, however. For example, “anti-natalists” see life as a terrible crime, as the badness of our pains outweigh the goodness of our pleasures, resulting in net negative value lives. They thus want life on Earth to go extinct. Maybe, they say, it would be okay to only create really-rich better-emotionally-adjusted creatures. But not the humans we have now. Many kinds of “conservatives” are proud to note that their ancestors changed in order to win prior evolutionary competitions. But they are generally opposed to future such changes. They want only limited changes to our tech, culture, lives, and values; bigger changes seem like abominations to them. Many “socialists” are furious that some of us are richer and more influential than others. Furious enough to burn down everything if we don’t switch soon to more egalitarian systems of distribution and control. The fact that our existing social systems won difficult prior contests does not carry much weight with them. They insist on big radical changes now, and disavow any failures associated with prior attempts made under their banner. None of that was “real” socialism, you see. Due to continued global competition, local adoption of anti-natalist, conservative, or socialist agendas seems insufficient to ensure these as global outcomes. Now most fans of these things don’t care much about long term outcomes. But some do. Some of those hope that global social pressures, via global social norms, may be sufficient. And others suggest using stronger global governance.","In fact, our scales of governance, and level of global governance, have been increasing over centuries. Furthermore, over the last half century we have created a world community of elites, wherein global social norms and pressures have strong power. However, competition at the largest scales has so far been our only robust solution to system rot and suicide, problems that may well apply to systems of global governance or norms. Furthermore, centralized rulers may be reluctant to allow civilization to expand to distant places which they would find it harder to control. This post resulted from Agnes Callard asking me to comment on Scott Alexander’s essay Meditations On Moloch, wherein he takes similarly stark positions on these grand issues. Alexander is irate that the world is not adopting various utopian solutions to common problems, such as ending corporate welfare, smaller militaries, and common hospital medical record systems. He seems to blame all of that, and pretty much anything else that has ever gone wrong, on something he personalizes into a monster “Moloch.” And while Alexander isn’t very clear on what exactly that is, my best read is that it is the general phenomenon of competition (at least the bad sort); that at least seems central to most of the examples he gives. Furthermore, Alexander fears that, in the long run, competition will force our descendants to give up absolutely everything that they value, just to exist. Now he has no empirical or theoretical proof that this will happen; his post is instead mostly a long passionate primal scream expressing his terror at this possibility. (Yes, he and I are aware that cooperation and competition systems are often nested within each other. The issue here is about the largest outer-most active system.) Alexander’s solution is: Elua. He is the god of flowers and free love and all soft and fragile things. Of art and science and philosophy and love. Of niceness, community, and civilization. He is a god of humans. … Only another god can kill Moloch. We have one on our side, but he needs our help. We should give it to him. By which Alexander means: start with a tiny weak AI, induce it to “foom” (sudden growth from tiny to huge), resulting in a single “super-intelligent” AI who rules our galaxy with an iron fist, but wrapped the velvet glove of being “friendly” = “aligned”. By definition, such a creature makes the best possible utopia for us all. Sure, Alexander has no idea how to reliably induce a foom or to create an aligned-through-foom AI, but there are some people pondering theses questions (who are generally not very optimistic). My response: yes of course if we could easily and reliably create a god to mange a utopia where nothing ever goes wrong, maybe we should do so. But I see enormous risks in trying to induce a single AI to grow crazy fast and then conquer everything, and also in trying to control that thing later via pre-foom","Or maybe even using AI to be a “global planner” that could optimize our future. But if we want to have any hope of doing that, we need to first be able to be sure of what we want. The question is: What should we want, and how should we want it? That is, what is the right set of values, or the right set of values and goals, that we should have, in order to have the best chance of getting what we want? That is, what is the right way to want? The answer is: we need to want to want, not just to do. We need to be the kind of people who want to want, who are capable of changing our values, who can improve our values, who are open to the possibility that our current values are not the best, and who are willing to work on that. We need to be open to the possibility that we are not the best people we could be. We need to be open to the possibility that we are not the best people we could be. We need to be open to the possibility that we are not the best people we could be. This is the only way to get the right set of values. This is the only way to get the right set of values. This is the “right way to want.” So the conclusion is: we should want to want, and we should want to be open to the possibility that our current values are not the best. The text is about the author's reflections on the nature of human values and the importance of being open to changing them. The author suggests that to have the best chance of achieving our goals, we need to be open to changing our values. The author also emphasizes the importance of being open to the possibility that our current values may not be the best. The author's main point is that we should want to want, and be open to changing our values.

Robin Hanson,Our Alien Stalkers.txt,"Sam Quirk was ten years old. While on a field trip, his bus had paused at a rest stop, and Sam was sitting in a bathroom stall. From the next stall over, he heard clearly but quietly, “Sam Quirk, ask your parents about ‘royal propriety’”. By the time he could check the next stall, it was empty. Back at home, Sam asked his parents. They looked grave, and told him that something similar had happened to them roughly every ten years for their entire lives. Except that after the first time, all they heard was just the phrase “royal propriety”. Now they told Sam what their parents had told them: “We are royalty.”
Sam’s dad was descended from a rich and powerful line of royalty that was famous for its being very secretive. Hardly anything was known about them, including where any of them lived. The lawyer who represented them issued rare press releases, which said little. Long ago, a representative of this royal org had contacted Sam’s great granddad, and explained to him how very important it was that no one from their line ever appear in the public eye. To demonstrate their determination, they promised to give these personal once-a-decade “royal propriety” reminders. The message: they are still around, and still care. They also hinted at dire consequences for any violations of this rule. So far their family had always complied. And as far as anyone in the family knows, this royal org has never helped them in any way, nor suggested that it ever would. Should Sam feel lucky to be part of such a rich illustrious royal family? Or unlucky to have such a powerful and hostile family stalker? I offer this story as an allegory of my best guess of humanity’s situation if some UFOs are in fact aliens. Remember that I don’t claim that they are. Only that I find it hard to see honest mistakes as explaining our strongest most dramatic UFO reports, that due to my grabby aliens work I am something of an expert on the prior for this some-UFOs-are-aliens hypothesis, and also on its social implications, and I thus feel obligated to resist the usual taboos to give my best estimate on both these topics. Many suggest that UFOs-as-aliens would put us in a position of radical uncertainty, wherein we’d have almost no idea who are these aliens, how many others are out there, or what any of them want. In contrast, I think we can actually say quite a lot. Alas, it is not a pretty picture. The most likely scenario that I can find consistent with some UFOs being aliens starts with life appearing ~9Gya on a one-in-a-million-galaxies-rare planet Eden somewhere in our galaxy. Then ~5Gya life was transferred via panspermia to many of the ~1000 newborn stars in our Sun’s stellar nursery. Life continued to evolve on those stars, until >~0.1Gya one of them gave rise to an advanced alien civilization.","Civilizations that allow interstellar colonization probably cannot maintain civ-wide governance to regulate, prevent war, and prevent their descendants from evolving into strangeness. For this or other reasons, this particular alien civilization chose to prevent any part of itself from leaving its home system to colonize the universe. However, it made rare exceptions for expeditions to stellar siblings that could be seen in telescopes as hosting life, and thus at risk of birthing another advanced civilization. The main motive was to prevent such a “panspermia sibling” civilization from violating their rule against expansion. But they’d rather achieve this via persuasion, rather than extermination. As each expedition risked violating their rule by going rogue, home authorities wanted a simple robust strategy; they didn’t trust expeditions to exercise much discretion. While alien visitors to Earth could have remained completely invisible, or become very obvious, they instead chose a third way. Their strategy was this: hang out on Earth at the periphery of our vision, act peacefully, show very impressive abilities, but reveal little else about themselves. Why? Social animals consistently have status hierarchies, and we humans have consistently domesticated other animals (and ourselves) by putting ourselves at the top of their status hierarchies. So the aliens hoped to do this with us. However, they also guessed that if they revealed too many details about themselves, we’d likely find something to hate, spoiling this status effect. Thus the plan: if we didn’t come to hate them, then once we became convinced that they really exist, we could figure out their agenda by ourselves without their saying a word. And then we had a decent chance of going along with it; after all, most today who believe that some UFOs are aliens also seem to trust aliens more than their local authorities. If we didn’t go along, they would at some point have to intervene. So this is our fate if some UFOs are aliens. We will either go along with their no-expansion rule, or become more directly controlled, or exterminated. In the coming centuries they will probably tell us no more about themselves, nor help us in any other way, and we will not figure out much on our own. Not even the location of their local base. Maybe we will identify their home world via telescope. And maybe they have hidden messages in the details of their frequent displays, but probably not. We should be quite impressed by the fact that these aliens not only managed to keep their civilization going for over 100My, but they’ve also managed to enforce their no-expansion rule for that whole time. After all, it would have taken just one tiny successful rebel slipping away unseen to end it. But we should also wonder how much their abilities may have decayed and rotted over that long period. With enough rot, we might just have a long-shot chance of developing ems or AIs and then slipping them off to colonize the universe unnoticed. But probably not. Which seems to","That civilization, let’s call them the Emissaries, was very advanced, and had a plan. They wanted to make sure that their own existence, and their own culture, was not known. They were not a hostile race. They were not trying to conquer or to colonize. They were trying to remain hidden, and to avoid being discovered. They were not trying to be nice, either. They were trying to make sure that their existence would not be discovered by anyone. They had a strong cultural belief that their own existence, their own culture, was something that should be kept secret. It was a cultural imperative. They were not trying to be nice, but they were not trying to be evil. They were trying to be invisible. That is their cultural imperative. So, the Emissaries, in their advanced technological capabilities, started to use their tech to spread their own culture, and to create a kind of “royal propriety” system. They used their tech to create “royal propriety” reminders to all the life on the planet Earth. They created a system where, for each person in the Earth’s population, they had a unique “royal propriety” message, which was a short phrase, which would be given to them once every ten years. The messages were not about the Emissaries themselves. They were about the Emissaries’ cultural imperative: to remain invisible. So, the message was: “You are royalty.” The message was given to each person once every ten years, to remind them of their own importance. And this is how we came to be here, in the 21st century, with our “royal propriety” messages. The Emissaries, through their technology, made sure that these messages were given to each person on Earth once every ten years. The messages were given through various means: through a radio signal, through a satellite, through a phone call, through a message in a bottle,",494,500,314,0.1144,0.1072,0.9505,0.9506,0.9365,0.812,1.1992,-3.326,0.337,0.2821,0.022,0.0295,0.0057,0.004,0.2174,0.3602,0.9704,0.9511,0.42657342657342656,0.44173913043478263,0.4789473684210526,6,6,0.9753,0.9421,0.1396761133603239,0.128,0.16560509554140126,0.973,0.5844,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,MacAskill on Value Lock-In.txt,"Will MacAskill has a new book out today, What We Owe The Future, most of which I agree with, even if that doesn’t exactly break new ground. Yes, the future might be very big, and that matters a lot, so we should be willing to do a lot to prevent extinction, collapse, or stagnation. I hope his book induces more careful future analysis, such as I tried in Age of Em. (FYI, MacAskill suggested that book’s title to me.) I also endorse his call for more policy and institutional experimentation. But, as is common in book reviews, I now focus on where I disagree. Aside from the future being important, MacAskill main concern in his book is “value lock-in”, by which he means a future point in time when the values that control actions stop changing. But he actually mixes up two very different processes by which this result might arise. First, an immortal power with stable values might “take over the world”, and prevent deviations from its dictates. Second, in a stable universe decentralized competition between evolving entities might pick out some most “fit” values to be most common. MacAskill’s most dramatic predictions are about this first “take over” process. He claims that the next century or so is the most important time in all of human history:
We hold the entire future in our hands. … By choosing wisely, we can be pivotal in putting humanity on the right course. … The values that humanity adopts in the next few centuries might shape the entire trajectory of the future. … Whether the future is government by values that are authoritarian or egalitarian, benevolent or sadistic, exploratory or rigid, might well be determined by what happens this century. His reason: we will soon create AGI, or ems, who, being immortal, have forever stable values. Some org will likely use AGI to “take over the world”, and freeze in their values forever:
Advanced artificial intelligence could enable those in power to to lock in their values indefinitely. … Since [AGI] software can be copied with high fidelity, an AGI can survive changes in the hardware instantiating it. AGI agents are potentially immortal. These two features of AGI – potentially rapid technological progress and in-principle immortality – combine to make value lock-in a real possibility. …
Using AGI, there are a number of ways that people could extend their values much farther into the future than ever before. First, people may be able to create AGI agents with goals closely assigned with their own which would act on their behalf. … [Second,] the goals of an AGI could be hard-coded: someone could carefully specify what future white want to see and ensure that the AGI aims to achieve it. … Third, people could potentially “upload”. …
International organizations or private actors may be able to leverage AGI to attain a level of power not seen since the days of the East India Company, which in effect ruled large areas of India.","… A single set of values could emerge. …The ruling ideology could in principle persist as long as civilization does. AGI systems could replicate themselves as many times as they wanted, just as easily as we can replicate software today. They would be immortal, freed from the biological process of aging, able to create back-ups of themselves and copy themselves onto new machines. … And there would not longer be competing value systems that could dislodge the status quo. … Bostrom’s book Superintelligence. The scenario most closely associated with that book is one in which a single AI agent … quickly developing abilities far greater than the abilities of all of humanity combined. … It would therefore be incentivize to take over the world. … Recent work has looked at a broader range of scenarios. The move from subhuman intelligence to super intelligence need not be ultrafast or discontinuous to post a risk. And it need not be a single AI that takes over; it could be many. … Values could become even more persistent in the future if a single value system were to become global dominant. If so, then the absence of conflict and competition would remove one reason for change in values over time. Conquest is the most dramatic pathway … and it may well be the most likely. Now mere immortality seems far from sufficient to create either value stability or a takeover. On takeover, immortality is insufficient. Not only is a decentralized world of competing immortals easy to imagine, but in fact until recently individual bacteria, who very much compete, were thought to be immortal. On values, immortality also seems far from sufficient to induce stable values. Human organizations like firms, clubs, cities, and nations seem to be roughly immortal, and yet their values often greatly change. Individual humans change their values over their lifetimes. Computer software is immortal, and yet its values often change, and it consistently rots. Yes, as I mentioned in my last post, some imagine that AGIs have a special value modularity that can ensure value stability. But we have many good reasons to doubt that scenario. Thus MacAskill must be positing that a power who somehow manages to maintain stable values takes over and imposes its will everywhere forever. Yet the only scenario he points to that seems remotely up to this task is Bostrom’s foom scenario. MacAskill claims that other scenarios are also relevant, but doesn’t even try to show how they could produce this result. For reasons I’ve given many times before, I’m skeptical of foom-like scenarios. Furthermore, let me note that even if one power came to dominate Earth’s civilization for a very long time, it would still have to face competition from other grabby aliens in roughly a billion years. If so, forever just isn’t at issue here. While MacAskill doesn’t endorse any regulations to deal with this stable-AGI-takes-over scenario, he does endorse regulations to deal with the other path to value stability: evolution. He wants","… The world may be on the brink of a new kind of “emperor” – a superintelligent AGI that is not a human, but a machine. …
But the problem with this argument is that it’s not clear that AGI will be created in the next century, or that even if it is, that it will be used to take over the world. The future is too uncertain. MacAskill’s argument seems to be that the next century is the most important in human history, and that we should focus on preventing value lock-in, because AGI is coming. But the problem is that even if AGI is coming, we can’t be sure it will be created in the next century, and even if it is, we can’t be sure it will be used to take over the world. So the future is still uncertain, and we can’t be certain that the values that humanity adopts in the next few centuries will shape the entire trajectory of the future. So, in that sense, the future is still uncertain, and we can’t be sure that our actions now will be pivotal.
So, in my view, MacAskill is wrong to claim that the next century is the most important in human history. His argument for this is that AGI is coming, and that if we create AGI with bad values, it will be locked in forever. But that’s not the only possibility. The next century could see the development of AGI, but that AGI could be used for good, or not. It could be used to take over the world, or not. It could be destroyed, or not. Or it could not be created. And even if it is created, maybe it’s not locked in for eternity. Maybe it can be updated, or even maybe it’s not immortal. So the future is still very uncertain. Even if we think AGI is likely to be created, the risk of value lock-in is not as high",500,500,330,0.272,0.3815,0.9784,0.9359,0.8194,0.9446,-3.5897,-1.1022,0.3644,0.4367,0.0386,0.1176,0.0067,0.0524,0.4541,0.728,0.9689,0.9563,0.37606837606837606,0.38528896672504376,0.5307692307692308,8,5,0.9626,0.9903,0.142,0.12,0.12727272727272726,0.9751,0.5547,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Moral Progress Is Not Like STEM Progress.txt,"In this post I want to return to the question of moral progress. But before addressing that directly, I first want to set up two reference cases for comparison. My first comparison case is statistics. Statistics is useful, and credit for the value that statistics adds to our discussions goes to several sources: to the statisticians who develop stat tests and estimates, to the teachers who transmit those tools to others, and to the problem specialists who find useful places to apply stats. We can tell that statisticians deserve credit because we can usually identify the particular tests and estimates being used (e.g., “chi test”) in each case, and can trace those back to the teachers who taught them, and the researchers who developed them. New innovations are novel combinations of stat details whose effectiveness depends greatly on those details. We can see the first use cases of each such structure, and then see how a habit of its use spread. Similar stories apply to many STEM areas, where we can distinguish particular design elements and analysis tools, and trace them back to their teachers and innovators. We can thus credit those innovators with their contributions, and verify that we have in fact seen substantial progress in these areas. We can see many cases where new tools let us improve on the best we could do with old tools. My second comparison case is the topic area of home arrangement: what things to put in what drawers and rooms in our homes, and what activities to do in what parts of what rooms at what times of the day or week. Our practices in these areas result from copying the choices of our parents, friends, TV shows, and retailers, and also from experimenting with personal variations to see what we like. Over our lifetimes, we each tend to get more satisfied with our choices. It is less clear, however, how much humanity as a whole improves in this area over time. Oh, we prefer our homes to homes of centuries ago. But this is most clearly because we have bigger nicer homes, that we fill with more nicer things than our ancestors had or could afford. As new items become available, our plans for which things go where, and what we do with them when, have adapted over time. But it isn’t clear that humanity learns much after an early period of adaptation to each new item. Yes, for each choice we make, we can usually offer an argument for why that choice is better, and sometimes we can remember where we heard that argument. But the general set of arguments used in this area doesn’t seem to expand or improve much over time. It is possible and even plausible that, even so, we are slowly getting better in general at knowing where to put things and what to do when in homes.","Even if we don’t learn new general principles, we may be slowly getting better at reducing our case specific errors relative to our constant general principles. But if so, the value of this progress seems to be modest, compared to our other related sources of progress, such as bigger houses, better items, and more free time to spend on them. And it seems pretty clear that little of the progress that we have seen here is to be credited to researchers specializing in home arrangement or personal activity scheduling. We don’t share much general abstract knowledge about this area, and haven’t added much lately to whatever of that we once had. We see similar situations in many other areas where there is widespread practice, but few research specialists or teachers of newly researched tools. There might be progress in reducing errors where practice deviates from widely accepted stable principles, but if so that progress seems modest relative to progress due to other factors, such as better technology, increased wealth, and larger populations. With these two reference cases in mind, STEM tools and home arrangement, let us now consider moral progress. The world seems to many to be getting more moral over time. But that could be because we have been getting richer and safer, which makes morality more affordable to us. Or it could be due to random correlated drift in our practices and standards, combined with our habit of judging past practices by current standards. However, it also seems possible, at least at first glance, that our world is getting more apparently moral because of improved moral abilities, holding constant our wealth and knowledge about non-moral topics. For example, moral researchers might be acquiring more objective genera knowledge about morality, knowledge which morality teachers then spread to the rest of us, who then apply those improved moral tools to particular cases. In support of this theory, many people point to particular moral arguments when they defend the morality of particular behaviors, and they often point to particular human sources for those arguments. Furthermore, many of those sources are new and canonical, so that a great many people in each era point to the same few sources, sources that are different from those to which prior generations pointed. Does this show progress? If you look carefully at the specific moral arguments that people cite to support their behavior, it turns out that those arguments look pretty similar to arguments that were known long before. While each new generation’s canonical sources have some unique examples, styles, and argument details, those differences don’t seem to matter much to the practices of the ordinary people who cite them. This situation seems in sharp contrast to the case of progress in statistics, for example, where the details of each new statistical test or estimate show up clearly and matter greatly to applications of those stats. It seems more consistent with moral arguments being used to justify behavior that would have happened anyway, rather than","But the evidence for this is very weak, and the progress is not as clear or substantial as in the case of statistics. This is because, in home arrangement, the options are so constrained by the physical world that the improvements in knowledge are limited to the scope of the physical world. So even if we have better knowledge about the physical world, the knowledge that we can apply to home arrangements is limited, and doesn't improve as rapidly as in the case of statistics. 

Now, what does this have to do with moral progress?

Well, the idea is that moral progress is a bit like home arrangement, but with the added complexity that the options are not constrained by the physical world. We can think of moral progress as the process of improving our understanding of what is morally right or wrong, and how to act in accordance with those moral principles. In the case of home arrangement, the options are limited by the physical world. For example, if you have a certain number of drawers and a certain amount of space, you can only arrange things in a certain way. But in the case of morality, the options are not limited in the same way. We can imagine a wide range of moral possibilities, and we can explore them more freely. This is one reason why moral progress is more difficult to measure and assess. The moral options are not constrained by the physical world, but by our own understanding and the complexity of the ethical landscape. 

Another aspect of the comparison is that in the case of home arrangement, the improvements in knowledge are limited by the scope of the physical world. For example, if you have a new item, you can only use it in the ways that are compatible with the existing structure of your home. But in the case of morality, the options are not limited in the same way. We can imagine a wide range of moral possibilities, and we can explore them more freely. This is one reason why moral progress is more difficult to measure and assess. The moral options are",483,500,360,0.2501,0.1025,0.9499,0.8879,0.7934,0.9491,5.5011,-1.0749,0.4181,0.3301,0.049,0.0436,0.0052,0.003,0.4764,0.5114,0.973,0.9461,0.4530386740331492,0.4103019538188277,0.5276381909547738,8,6,0.9739,0.9962,0.11594202898550725,0.108,0.10555555555555556,0.8993,0.7524,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Kipping on Grabby Aliens.txt,"If you recall, our grabby aliens analysis tries to explain 3 key datums: a) we don’t see any huge alien civs in our sky b) we have arrived at a very early date in the universe, and c) there is only ~1Gyr left for life on Earth. Each datum allows us to estimate a matching parameter of our 3 parameter model: a) alien civ expansion rate, b) time constant for appearance rate, c) power in power law of appearance rate. We can thus roughly estimate the spacetime distribution of such visible alien civs. In a new video, David Kipping respectfully disagrees:
I have three major criticisms …
[1.] Grabby aliens is predicated among the Hard Steps Model, which we don't know to be true. [2.] There is a much easier [solution] available to us, … that M dwarfs are not habitable to begin with. [3.] The theory invokes what to me is a kind of Get Out of Jail Free card. It states the grabby aliens are all expanding at speeds close to the speed of light. … [But] there is no experiment we can design that can falsify this hypothesis, even in principle. Instead Kipping prefers:
far simpler hypothesis is twofold. First, M dwarfs don't permit creatures like us to develop on them, solving the Red Sky Paradox and our apparently early emergence in cosmic history. Second, the emergence of aggressive expanding civilizations just doesn't happen for some reason. …
Earth's environment is changing on a timescale that is linked to the sun's main sequence lifetime, and those changing conditions would surely precipitate evolutionary adaptations for Earth's inhabitants. …
If intelligence bestows evolutionary advantages, then perhaps perhaps it is inevitable given a few billion years. … the probability of transitioning from a human-like civilization to a grabby aliens one, perhaps … is just incredibly small, and that explains why we don't see them. That is, Kipping says (like others) that in our history there were no hard try-try steps, not even at the origin of life; intelligent life at our level was largely inevitable on a planet like ours, though it had to wait for the Sun to evolve to a matching state, which coincidentally took about half the Sun’s history. (A coincidence explained well by the hard steps model.)
If our type of planet isn’t crazy rare, that should create a crazy huge number of places with alien intelligence among the ~10^24 stars in the observable universe. Kipping says we don’t see any because of a crazy small chance that intelligence like ours gives rise to a distantly-visible civilization. This seems to me very bad news about our future, though Kipping doesn’t seem bothered by it. I don’t understand Kipping’s issue with “falsifying” very fast aliens. We won’t directly test any hypothesis on alien speeds until we see them, at which point we’d confirm a fast speed as easily as a slow one.","And we will know much sooner how fast we can go, first based on engineering analyses, and then on our own realized travel speeds. I agree with Kipping that it is modestly surprising that we find ourselves on a star as big as the sun; smaller ones are more numerous, though their fraction of potential planet metabolism is smaller. I also agree that planets at small stars face more obstacles, though I’m more optimistic than Kipping about ocean worlds there. My biggest issue with Kipping’s scenario is his crazy small estimated chance of intelligence like ours getting grabby. Seems to me we’ve already done rough engineering calculations which suggest that interstellar colonization looks possible, and even at high speeds. And the biological/economic pressures that would induce expansion, when its possible, have long seemed obvious. I could much more easily believe a version of “rare Earth”, either with very rare Earth context, or some crazy huge try-once steps in the early history of life. That is, life appears widely, but it almost always falls fast into a bad structure, from which it can’t escape. Three corrections. First, Kipping highlights me but doesn’t mention my coauthors: Martin, McCarter, & Paulson. I couldn’t have done this without them. Second, Kipping says: We'll encounter this wave of [grabby alien] colonization in about a billion year's time, and Hanson predicts a one in 10,000 chance that we will ourselves become such a grabby civilization before that time. Actually, while we calculate observational implications for many different chance levels, we give no estimate ourselves. Finally: Hanson's model not only assumes hard steps, but also that the number of hard steps is a universal value on every planet and moon out there. As step difficulties vary over such a wide range, if there are a wide range of possible hard steps paths, the most likely number of steps is probably far more likely than other numbers. Added 9Sep: Avi Loeb also has a recent post criticizing grabby aliens! Odd that 3 astrophysicists all posted critiques the same month, 3 years after we published. Is there a campaign behind the scenes? Loeb says that small stars might not be able to long host life. Which we agree is possible, though far from obvious; ocean worlds are very common and seem immune from most small start problems. Loeb also complains: Travel at relativistic speeds requires an unrealistic energy supply … and unrealistic shielding. But we are talking about aliens millions to billions of years more advanced than us, we already seem to have promising designs for 0.15c speeds, and our high speed estimate is an inference from data, not an assumption as Loeb calls it. Loeb errs here: the authors argue that the ratio of quiet to loud alien civilizations must be over 10,000 for there to be even one alien civilization ever in our galaxy. Since our civilization is regarded as quiet for now, our chance of becoming grabby is the inverse of this ratio, namely less than","…
So, in conclusion, Kipping is arguing that the Grabby Aliens hypothesis is not only less supported by the data, but also more dangerous to the future of humanity.
The conclusion is that the Grabby Aliens hypothesis is not only less supported by the data, but also more dangerous to the future of humanity. But how does this reconcile with the fact that the Grabby Aliens hypothesis says that we are in an early time of the universe, and that we have a short time before the Sun dies? That is, the Grabby Aliens hypothesis says that we have only 1Gyr left before the Sun dies, but Kipping is arguing that we have a lot more time (since Earth's environment is changing with the Sun, but that’s only a few billion years. So the Sun’s main sequence lifetime is ~10Gyr. So Earth's environment is changing, but that’s only a few billion years. So the Sun’s main sequence lifetime is ~10Gyr. So Earth's environment is changing, but that’s only a few billion years. So the Sun’s main sequence lifetime is ~10Gyr. So Earth's environment is changing, but that’s only a few billion years.

Robin Hanson,Escalating Signals Cut Fertility.txt,"My wife and I feed wet food to our two cats Ben and Jerry at the same time every day. Ben spends the whole prior hour crying for that food. He seems to be expect that, if not for his lobbying, we’d never feed him. Jerry instead spends a similar time spread out across the prior 24 hours lobbying for our immediate attention. He seems to expect that we wouldn’t feed or house him if he could not induce us to pay enough regular attention to him. I interpret this as our cats being stuck in signaling equilibria. You “signal” when your actions take into account the inferences you expect others to draw from them. And you “screen” when you take actions to induce others to signal. Many call me an extremist for estimating substantial signaling and screening effects in 90% of human life areas, but that still seems plausible to me. Our cats want to show us that they need us, and want us to show them that we care about and plan to take care of them. Less by directly taking care of them, and more by giving them lots of attention. Mutual need and attention signals take a lot of time and energy, but are quite common not only between people and pets, but also between friends and lovers, and parents and children. For example, I’ve been watching my 18-month-old granddaughter interact with her parents. And it is pretty clear to me that the kid demands and gets far more attention than is strictly needed to feed, protect, and teach her. The “over-parenting” attention that US parents have been giving to their kids has greatly increased over recent centuries. I interpret this as an escalation of our signaling standards. Previously typical levels of parent attention are now seen as inadequate negligence, cruelly letting your kids see that you don’t love them as much as other parents love their kids. (I think our signals to pets have also increased.)
(Note that the capitalist fertility solution I’ve outlined, wherein parents pay for parenting by endowing kids with debt or equity, would send an an especially bad signal in these terms. Parents are supposed to eagerly give kids the gift of life and attention, not charge them for the privilege.)
This escalation of parent signaling is an obstacle to reversing fertility decline, as parents who feel obligated to attend more to each kid are inclined to have fewer kids. This is why my colleague Bryan Caplan wrote The Selfish Reason to Have More Kids, to argue that less-attended-to kids will do just fine. Alas, we also have many other escalating signal trends that discourage fertility. Together these add up to our biggest obstacle to increasing fertility. For example, while our standard career ladders contain some actually useful training and preparation, much of it is signaling. By successfully running standardized gauntlets on fixed time schedules, we show our attractive abilities and inclinations.","(See Caplan’s book The Case Against Education.) But as those who have worse abilities and inclinations are naturally more tempted to take pauses from such gauntlets, we tend to think less of those who pause them for any reason, including to have kids. This encourages us to wait to have kids until after we have completed as much as we can or desire of available gauntlets. And as years of schooling has been increasing over the centuries, especially for women, this has discouraged childcare-requiring fertility by young people. By the time women feel ready, their bodies are often unable to have kids. And even men notice that their declining energy levels may not be sufficient for our demanding over-parenting effort standards. Less career security, and more work hours per week, also likely discourage fertility. A third escalating signal that discourages fertility, besides more over-parenting and pause-less schooling, is our increasing respect for “finding ourselves” before picking a long term mate. In previous centuries it was more okay to pair up early, while your identity was still plastic, with an easily found local mate. You’d then mould yourself to your partner, and explore what the two of you might become together. (Which for peasants usually wasn’t much.) We now look down on that, and more respect young adults who shape themselves alone. Then once they’ve achieved more distinctive personal styles and interests, they search among vast numbers of potential partners for the few who most closely match what they have become. (This trend goes along with an increasing taste for variety more generally.) To many, it makes more sense for better artists to develop more unique personal styles, while lesser artists master existing styles. And that it makes more sense for top intellectuals to pioneer new frames, while lesser intellectuals fill in existing frames. Similarly, we tend to see choosing to be flexible to shape yourself to another person at a young age as admitting that you have less potential for what you might become by yourself. We thus see traditional gender roles as disrespecting the younger women who it matches to older men. We also look down on those who marry early in life as we see them as more boring and less “fun.” That is, we see dating many different people over many years as more “fun” than marriage, and see it as inducing a wider ranging experiences that make us more interesting. (Relatedly, the book Pedigree reports that elite recruiters dislike job candidates who are “tools”, with hobbies too close to their careers.) Our looking down on those who “settle” early on long-term mates thus induces us to take longer to choose. As with long career gauntlets, by the time we feel ready to choose a long term mate, we may be too old to have kids. The book Promises I Can Keep (recommended to me by Caplan) describes how lower class US women now wait longer to marry because of their increased reverence for marriage. They have","We signal to employers that we are capable of managing time and responsibilities, and we signal to others that we are “serious” and “diligent.” So the standard career lattices are a signaling system, not just a training system. And as the career lattices grow more complex, more time is spent on signaling, and less time is available for the work that actually matters, which is creating things and solving problems. So the same applies to the education system. The more time we spend on standardized tests and grading, the more time we waste on signaling. And the more time we spend on that, the more time we have to waste on signaling in other areas, like our careers, and in our relationships. In fact, the more time we spend on signaling, the more time we have to waste on signaling. The more we waste on signaling, the more time we have to waste on signaling. It is a feedback loop, a self-reinforcing escalation.
This feedback loop is especially strong in our culture of “perfectionism.” We are told that our lives are only valuable if we are perfect. So we spend time on things like cleaning, exercising, dieting, and other activities that signal our perfection. We are told that our lives are only valuable if we are perfect, so we spend time on things that signal our perfection, and so on. This is a self-reinforcing escalation, as well. So the more we spend on signaling, the more we have to spend on signaling. And the more we spend on signaling, the more we have to spend on signaling.
This is all a bit abstract. Let me give you a concrete example. Imagine that you are a parent who is trying to decide whether to have a second child. You are in the process of deciding. Your child is already getting a lot of attention. You are feeling that you are already giving them enough attention. But now you are thinking, “Wait, if I have another child",491,500,335,0.1647,0.1846,0.9622,0.9464,0.9464,0.7604,1.0908,-4.6171,0.332,0.3342,0.0297,0.0242,0.002,0.0,0.1449,0.3735,0.9718,0.9366,0.41681574239713776,0.4121739130434783,0.509090909090909,6,4,0.9873,0.9852,0.11405295315682282,0.126,0.14029850746268657,0.8612,0.5636,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Why Not Heterodox Research_.txt,"The following claim seems both roughly true and pregnant with implications:
The vast majority of statements that appear in natural human conversation, such as at dinner parties or on social media, are clearly unsuitable for inclusion as content (not study object) in the vast majority of academic journal articles. Similar but weaker claims apply to academic books and lectures. Yes, there may be rare weird journals with quite different standards that some call “academic”, but they are exceptional, and most academics pause before even calling them “academic”. This unsuitability seems clear to article authors, reviewers, and editors. It’s not just that many statements don’t intend to persuade or to argue for general claims of general interest; my claim above holds even when limited to such statements. And it’s not the form of such statements; no rephrasing of them that keep the same meaning would be suitable. And it’s not just their topics; even statements within the topic categories of a journal would not be seen as suitable for that journal. Nor is it their tone or purpose; my claim applies even when speakers clearly present themselves as do academics, as serious people trying to think seriously and informatively about serious things. It even applies in larger conversation contexts where this is the consistent tone. Note: not only do such journal articles not include any such statements, they almost never cite articles that include such statements. And as authors are supposed to cite any sources that substantially influenced their article, their lack of citations seems to be them saying that the entire world of ordinary conversation has no substantial influence on the entire world of academic research. I conclude that each typical academic journal not only sees itself as covering a limited topic area, it also sees itself as being willing to consider only a limited range of concepts and argument types. Furthermore, these limits are quite strongly selective; the vast majority of statements that ordinary people actually generate on such topics, even when they are trying to talk seriously, are seen as unsuitable. Another way to say this is that typical academic disciplines (really sub-disciples) are organized around a very limited set of acceptable concepts and methods. Students of each discipline learn to comprehend, and then to apply, its accepted concepts and methods, and also to evaluate such applications. They become insiders by proving such abilities via submitting conforming articles, and having those submissions be positively evaluated by prior insiders. Plausibly we now find it quite hard to organize academic disciplines on any other basis. So if we want a world where articles within a discipline can be cheaply and reliably read and evaluated by others in that discipline, perhaps this is how we must organize them.","But notice a dramatic implication: individuals who master the concepts and methods of many disciplines, or who apply the concepts and methods that ordinary people naturally apply when talking in ordinary conversation about a topic, should be able to generate a much larger range of valid relevant arguments on that topic. So our usual academic practices must be excluding a vast space of possible valid and relevant but “heterodox” arguments. (And people seduced by the insight-potential of this larger space will tend to lose academic prestige contests.) Now it might happen to be that this larger set of valid relevant arguments doesn’t actually allow one to draw any better conclusions on some topic. One might be able to argue for any valid conclusion using a much more limited set of accepted concepts and methods, and to do this at no higher cost. In this case, nothing is lost by limiting articles to these few concepts and methods. To justify the further habit of academic articles almost never citing ordinary conversation, we’d need to make the further assumption that the very large practice of ordinary conversation almost never makes substantial contributions to topics of academic interest. In contrast, if the typical strong limits on discipline concepts and methods actually do prevent the use of many more cost-effective ways to generate valid relevant arguments, then we face a tradeoff between the costs (and benefits) of generating articles, versus the costs (and benefits) of evaluating articles. The habit of only considering articles that use (or cite) a very limited set of concepts and methods would have be justified by saying that the added cost (relevant to benefit) of evaluating heterodox articles is almost always greater than the added benefit (relative to cost) that such articles could provide via drawing relevant valid conclusions. That is, discipline authorities must claim: To make progress on our topics, our discipline’s concepts and methods are quite sufficient. Sure others might in principle use other concepts and methods to draw relevant conclusions on our topics more easily than do we, but the chance of that usually seems so low that we just habitually ignore all purported candidates of this sort. There are just not usually clues that could plausibly indicate such a scenario well enough to get us to consider including heterodox articles in our journals, or to consider citing them in our articles. The enormous costs to us of evaluating the quality of such heterodox contributions completely swamps any value they might have to offer. Note that this claim, and academic citation practices, seem to suggest that ordinary people just couldn’t possibly be generating much useful insight from their vast practice of non-academic conversation. They might bond with each other, impress each other, and have fun, but they couldn’t possibly be learning much. For me this issue highlights the great potential of innovations in how we evaluate contributions. Today, a reviewer typically takes an hour or two to review a dense 4-8K word research paper, where anyone in","So, in that sense, the structure is both natural and necessary. 

Okay, so I think I can see that the author is trying to make the point that academic journals are very narrow in their scope and that they only accept certain types of statements, even if they are from people who are trying to be serious. But I don't see the argument as entirely clear. I think the author is trying to say that the academic system is very rigid, but I'm not sure. Also, I think the author is saying that this is necessary for the academic system to function. Maybe I need to look at the structure of the argument and see if the author is making a valid point. 

Let me break down the argument step by step. The author starts by saying that most statements in natural human conversation are unsuitable for academic journals. Then they give several reasons why this is the case: the statements don't intend to persuade, they don't have the right form, they don't fit the topic categories, they don't have the right tone, etc. The author also notes that these journals don't cite such statements, implying that they don't value them. The conclusion is that academic disciplines are organized around a very limited set of concepts and methods, and students are trained to use these. The author seems to think that this is necessary for the academic system to function.

I think the author is making a valid point about the rigidity of academic journals. However, I'm not sure if the argument is entirely clear. The author might be conflating different aspects, such as the formality of language, the topic, and the purpose of the statements. Also, the author might be assuming that all academic journals are the same, which is not the case. There are different types of journals with different standards. The author also says that the academic system is necessary, but maybe that's not the case. There might be alternative ways to organize academic disciplines that are more flexible.

Robin Hanson,Futarchy For Fundraising.txt,"The Making of Modern Corporate Finance: A History of the Ideas and How They Help Build the Wealth of Nations (quotes below), by Donald Chew, persuaded me that for-profit-firm capitalism has varied quite a lot over space and time, and that the U.S. still has a big lead. Private equity works best, though it still only controls ~10% as much capital as public firms in the US, and even less elsewhere. Academics and other elites don’t report much on this story, as improvements usually defied their advice and pressures. The fact that hostile takeovers are widely hindered also tells me that we still have lots of room for improvement. Which raises my hopes that futarchy might also be allowed to help. Most CEOs are not at all eager for futarchy to advise on the decisions they feel they “own”. But it should be easier to get CEO support for futarchy advising decisions that they often cannot make on their own, but must instead make together with boards and investors. For example, futarchy could advise whether to keep or dump the CEO. Another promising application is decisions on when and how to raise more capital. The book says that when CEOs initiate a sale of more stock, stock prices fall by 2-3%, as investors fear secret CEO info on firm money problems, or that the stock price is currently too high. While board approval is usually required for such sales, that doesn’t prevent this problem. However when shareholder votes must also approve such stock sales, prices instead rise. The same pattern holds for mergers and acquisitions done with or without shareholder approval. Similarly, stocks rise 6-7% when activist investors buy blocks of stocks, intending to make governance proposals to be approved by shareholder votes. Thus there are many identifiable types of firm governance decisions where investors are right to be skeptical about CEO proposals, even when they are supported by boards. Requiring shareholder votes to approve those proposals is one kind of check, but instead requiring futarchy approval, or at least the lack of a futarchy veto, seems to me a faster cheaper better-informed alternative process. Great firm value may be unleashed via creating futarchy systems for such decisions. Those book quotes:
Corporate conglomerates had been “allowed to destroy 50% for more of the operating value of their franchises” before outside investors became willing and able to raise the funding to intervene.(p.xiv)
Stock prices do indeed fall - by 2-3% on average - upon seasoned equity offering announcements. … But why do they fall? Stew’s explanation … focuses on the infraction disadvantage of outside investors vis-a-vis managers or other insiders about matters like to affect the value of the firm. …
* The plan to raise any capital - debt or equity - increases the possibility, and investors’ suspicions, that the company is seeking new capital mainly just to make up for an unexpected shortfall in earnings for cash flows, and not to fund necessary or promising investment.","* Investors view managements and seeking to raise equality opportunistically - that is, when they think the company’s shares are overvalued - and to avoid issuing new shares when the company is undervalued, since this would effectively transfer value from the old shareholders to any new shareholders who take up the offering.

What Holderness finds is an astonishingly simple, and consistent, empirical regularity. When shareholders are required to approve new stock issues, the average stock returns to announcements of seasoned stock offerings by public companies are positive - on the order of 2% (and highly statistically significant). But when managers issue stock without shareholder approvals, as we have already seen in the case of U.S. public offerings, the returns are significant negative - a percent to -3%, on average. … Strikingly consistent positive market responses to announcements of large acquisitions by UK companies that require shareholder approval … in sharp contrast to the zero or negative average announcement returns for the transactions not subject to a shareholder vote. … U.S. M&A markets - where even the largest deals can easily be (and typically are) structured to avoid shareholder votes … the larger U.S. deals provide returns to shareholders that were significantly negative, on average.

Like many other studies of activists this one starts by confirming the market’s initial enthusiasm about activists block purchases and proposals. But the initial positive returns (of round 6-7% on almost all countries) are maintained only when the engagements lead to “events” with consequences - outcomes like increases in payouts, board replacements, or restructurings. In such cases the initial returns end up significantly higher than 6%. … the incidence and probability of activist engagements are greatest in in companies","…
* The announcement of the stock sale (equity offering) is also an implicit signal that the company is seeking to increase the number of shareholders and thus is less likely to be an “internal” or “closed” company, and thus less likely to be an “efficient” or “well-managed” company. …
* Finally, the announcement of the sale is a signal that the company is not currently in a strong financial position, and thus is less likely to be a “good” or “value-creating” company. …
So, the stock price drops not only because of the possibility of earnings shortfalls, but also because of the perception that the company is not in a strong financial position. The drop is not only about the company’s ability to fund its projects, but also about its ability to manage those projects. (p. 217)
And, more generally, when companies have to raise capital, the price of their stock tends to fall, as they are seen as less efficient and less well-managed. (p. 218)
The book says that the “most common” form of corporate governance in the U.S. is that the CEO is also the chair of the board of directors. (p. 246)
When the CEO is also the chair, he is more likely to be the one who controls the board. (p. 247)
The CEO is the one who controls the board, and the board is the one that controls the company. (p. 247)
The book also says that the “most common” form of corporate governance in the U.S. is that the CEO is also the chair of the board of directors. (p. 246)

Robin Hanson,UFOs – What The Hell_.txt,"(This post is more of an essay, intended to be especially widely accessible.)
Long ago, my physics teachers taught me to arrogantly dismiss the “paranormal”, like ghosts or telepathy. Or UFOs. Yes, we once saw meteorites as paranormal, but not today. Yes, we now accept ball lightning, even though evidence for it is weaker than for UFOs, but we have plausible theories there. However, when the topic of distant “aliens” came up recently in my research on the origin of life and the future of the universe, I browsed UFO evidence and found it to be much stronger than stuff on ghosts or telepathy. And now a U.S. military report says that intelligently controlled UFOs with amazing abilities seem real to them, even if they don’t know their cause. Hence my and perhaps your titular reaction, “What the Hell?” How can this make any sense? Turns out, my prior research prepared me to address this very question, once I gave it some thought. Not on the evidence for UFOs, where others are more expert than I. But on how to fit this idea of strange objects with amazing abilities under intelligent control into your scientific world view. (Note that I’m not claiming this as fact; I’m saying it isn’t crazy.)
While there are many possibilities here, it suffices for me to show just one. And yes, it involves aliens. We can easily believe that aliens are very advanced, and thus have amazing abilities. But two questions remain:
In a vast universe that looks dead everywhere, how is it that advanced aliens happen to be right here right now? Even if aliens did travel to be here now, why would they act as UFOs do: mute and elusive, yet still noticeable? First, note that our standard best scientific theories predict aliens. That is, they predict that life sometimes arises from simple dead matter, and can eventually evolve to make intelligent creatures like us. And this could happen most anywhere. Yes, the universe looks completely dead; we see no signs of life outside Earth, even though over millions of years advanced aliens could have made some big visible changes. Some possible explanations:
Aliens arise so rarely that the nearest ones are too far to see, or to have travelled to here,
Aliens are common but simply can’t travel between stars or make big visible changes,
Aliens are common and travel everywhere, but enforce rules against visible changes, or
Aliens arise rarely, but in small clumps; the first in clump to appear can control the others. Of these, only the last two can put aliens here now, and #3 seems too much a conspiracy (i.e., coordinate to hide) theory for my tastes. But scenario #4 works, and could plausibly result from “panspermia.”
That is, simple life might have arisen on a planet Eden long ago, via a very rare event.","(My research suggests this happens only once per million galaxies.) After life evolved at Eden for billions of years, a rock hit Eden, kicking up another rock that drifted for millions of years carrying life to seed our Sun’s stellar nursery. A nursery that held thousands of new stars packed close with many rocks flying around, allowing life to spread quickly to them all. Our sun’s siblings then drifted apart, while life evolved on each planet for billions of years. The first sibling planet to develop civilization did so millions of years ago, and it wasn’t Earth. These aliens then sought out their sibling stars and traveled to them to watch civilization maybe evolve there. Now, to explain the fact that these aliens have not visibly changed our shared galaxy, even though they can travel to here, we must postulate that they enforce a rule against making big visible changes, probably enforced by a strong central government. A rule against mass aggressive expansion, colonization, and disassembling of planets, stars, etc. Maybe due to environmentalist values, maybe to enable regulation, or maybe just to protect central control and status. Yes, this is something of a conspiracy theory, but being smaller, it seems easier to swallow. Okay, that is a not-crazy answer to the first question, on why aliens are here now in a dead universe. What about the second question, on why UFOs act so weird and coy? To answer this, I postulate two features of sibling alien preferences: 1) they want to get us to comply with their rule against making big visible changes to the universe, and 2) they are reluctant to just kill, crush, enslave, or dominate us to get this outcome (or they’d have already done one of these). Aliens somehow value something about us independent of their influence, and thus prefer us to organically and voluntary comply with their rule. To induce our voluntary min-change compliance, their plan is put themselves gently at the top of our status ladder. After all, social animals consistently have status ladders, with low status animals tending to emulate the higher. So if these aliens hang out close to us for a long time, show us their very impressive abilities, but don’t act overtly hostile, then we may well come to see them as very high status members of our tribe. (Not powerful hostile outsiders.) If we are smart enough to figure out that they have a rule against big visible changes, enforced via a “world” government, we may naturally emulate those policies. We may even come to treat UFO aliens as ancient humans treated their gods and top leaders, with respect, deference, and obedience. After all, most ancient people knew little about their gods and leaders beyond their impressive wealth and abilities, but that was usually enough. But why not just land on the White House lawn, meet with our leaders, and explain their agenda? Because once they start talking to us, we will have a lot of questions. Such","Then, some of those life forms evolved into intelligent aliens, and then they took over the planet (or maybe the planet was a planet of aliens, which is another story). They might have taken over our planet from the inside, or from the outside. But either way, they would have control of our planet, and could have been using it as a testing ground for their technology. So the aliens in the UFOs are not from other planets, but from Earth. So, I think that is the only plausible explanation for why aliens are here now. Because otherwise, if aliens were here before, and we had evolved to be intelligent, why would they not be here now? It’s a paradox. The paradox is solved by the idea that the aliens are actually here now. The aliens are us. Wait, no, that doesn’t make sense. Unless we are them. So the idea is that the aliens are not from other planets, but from Earth. So, the UFOs are not from other planets, but are here on Earth, controlled by us. But that’s the idea of the “alien invasion” in science fiction. But if that’s true, then why are we not aware of them? Because they are in control. So they are the ones who are controlling us. They are not the ones we are controlling. So they are the ones who have been here all along, and are now controlling the planet.
So, the conclusion is that the aliens are not from other planets, but from Earth. That is, they are us. But that is not possible. Unless, of course, we are not the only intelligence on Earth. So, that would be the idea of the “multi-level” intelligence. That is, we are not the only intelligence on Earth. There are others. So, the UFOs are controlled by other intelligent life on Earth. That is the idea of the “multi-level” intelligence. And that is the idea that the aliens are not",477,500,329,0.2506,0.3108,0.9785,0.9206,0.7637,0.716,4.9917,-4.5816,0.3631,0.3729,0.0363,0.0395,0.0056,0.0037,0.412,0.5191,0.9619,0.9512,0.39404553415061294,0.38671209540034074,0.5675,5,4,0.9843,0.9804,0.16771488469601678,0.154,0.17933130699088146,0.9741,0.551,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,"Forager v Farmer, Elaborated.txt","Seven years ago, after a year of reading up on forager lives, I first started to explore a forager vs. farmer axis:
A lot of today’s political disputes come down to a conflict between farmer and forager ways, with forager ways slowly and steadily winning out since the industrial revolution. It seems we acted like farmers when farming required that, but when richer we feel we can afford to revert to more natural-feeling forager ways. The main exceptions, like school and workplace domination and ranking, are required to generate industry-level wealth. (more)
Recently I decided to revisit the idea, to see if I could find a clearer story that accounts better for many related patterns. Here is what I’ve come up with. Our primate ancestors lived in a complex Machiavellian social world, with many nested levels of allies each coordinating to oppose outside rival groups of allies, often via violence. Humans, however, managed to collapse most of those levels into one: what Boehm has called a “reverse dominance hierarchy.” Human bands were mostly on good terms with neighboring bands, who they met infrequently. Inside each band, the whole group used weapons and language to coordinate to enforce shared social norms, to create a peaceful egalitarian safe space. Individuals who saw a norm violation could tell others, and then the whole band could discuss what to do about it. Once a consensus formed, the band could use weapons to enforce their collective decision. As needed, punishments could escalate from scolding to shunning to exile to death. Common norms included requirements to share food and protection, and bans on violence, giving orders, bragging, and creating subgroup factions. This worked often, but not always. People retained general Machiavellian social abilities, and usually used them covertly, just out of view of group norm enforcement. But sometimes the power of the collective waned, and then many would switch to acting more overtly Machiavellian. For example, an individual or a pair of allies might become so powerful that they could openly defy the group’s disapproval. Or such a pair might violate norms semi-privately, and use a threat of strong retaliation to dissuade others from openly decrying their violations. Or a nearby rival group might threaten to attack. Or a famine or flood might threaten mass mortality. In the absence of such threats, the talky collective was the main arena that mattered. Everyone worked hard to look good by the far-view idealistic and empathy-based norms usually favored in collective views. They behaved well when observed, learned to talk persuasively to the group, and made sure to have friends to watch and talk for them. They expressed their emotions, and acted like they cared about others. When they felt on good terms with the group, people could relax and feel safe. They then become more playful, and acted like animals generally do when playful. Within a bounded safe space, behavior becomes more varied, stylized, artistic, humorous, teasing, self-indulgent, and emotionally expressive.","For example, there is more, and more varied, music and dance. New possibilities are explored. A feeling of safety includes feeling safe to form more distinct subgroups, without others seeing such subgroups as threatening factions. And that includes feeling safe to form groups that tend to argue together for similar positions within talky collective discussions, and to disagree with the larger group. After all, it is hard for a talky collective to function well unless members are allowed to openly disagree with one another. But when the group was stressed and threatened by dominators, outsiders, or famine, the collective view mattered less, and people reverted to more general Machiavellian social strategies. Then it mattered more who had what physical resources and strength, and what personal allies. People leaned toward projecting toughness instead of empathy. And they demanded stronger signals of loyalty, such as conformity, and were more willing to suspect people of disloyalty. Subgroups and non-conformity became more suspect, including subgroups that consistently argued together for unpopular positions. And here is the key idea: individuals vary in the thresholds they use to switch between focusing on dealing with issues via an all-encompassing norm-enforcing talky collective, and or via general Machiavellian social skills, mediated by personal resources and allies. Everyone tends to switch together to a collective focus as the environment becomes richer and safer. (This is one of the many ways that behaviors and values consistently change with wealth.) But some switch sooner: those better at working the collective, such as being better at talking and empathy, and those who gain more from collective choices, such as physically weaker folks who can’t hunt or gather as well. And also people just generally less prone to feeling afraid as a result of ambiguous cues. People who feel less safe are more afraid of changing whatever has worked in the past, and so hold on more tightly to typical past behaviors and practices. They are more worried about the group damaging the talky collective, via tolerating free riders, allowing more distinct subgroups, and by demanding too much from members who might just up and leave. Also, those who feel less able to influence communal discussions prefer groups norms to be enforced more simply and mechanically, without as many exceptions that will be more influenced by those who are good at talking. I argue that this key “left vs. right” inclination to focus more vs less on a talky collective is the main parameter that consistently determines who people tend to ally with in large scale political coalitions. Other parameters can matter a lot in different times and places, but this is the one that consistently matters. This parameter doesn’t matter much for how individuals relate to each other personally, and at smaller social scales like clubs or firms, coalitions form more via our general Machiavellian abilities, based on parameters than matter directly in those contexts. But everyone has an intuitive sense for how much we all expect and want big issues to","This is the origin of most of the social and cultural practices we have today. It’s the origin of humor, theater, art, music, religion, and even many of the practices of modern politics. (more)
But then, a few thousand years ago, something changed. Maybe it was the development of agriculture, but that might not be the right answer. Maybe it was the invention of money, but that’s a later development. Or maybe it was the rise of the city, but that might not be the right answer either. What seems more likely is that the development of agriculture allowed for a small group of people to be more independent of the group, and thus more free to act in more Machiavellian ways. In other words, the group’s power to enforce norms was not enough to keep individuals from acting in Machiavellian ways. The rise of agriculture allowed for some individuals to become more self-reliant, to have more control over their lives, and to be more free to act like Machiavellians. But the group’s norms were still strong enough that most people remained in the collective, so we ended up with a mix of group norms and Machiavellian tendencies. (more)
This is the core idea: the group norms are a set of shared values that people adopt in order to live together in a safe space. But when individuals have more freedom, they can sometimes act more Machiavellian. The balance between these two tendencies determines the nature of the society. In modern societies, we are more like the farmers, but the foragers have been making a comeback. (more)
In the next section, I will explain the implications of this for modern society and how we might move toward a more forager-like future. (more)

Robin Hanson,Lying With Style.txt,"Clear and Simple as the Truth, the best book I've read in years, explains the virtues and lies of a very popular writing style. Excerpts:
A [writing] style is defined by its conceptual stand on truth, presentation, writer, reader, thought, language, and their relationships. … Classic style is in its own view clear and simple as the truth. It adopts the stance that its purpose is presentation; its motive is disinterested truth. Successful presentation consists of aligning language with truth, and the test of this alignment is clarity and simplicity. The idea that presentation is successful when language is aligned with truth implies that truth can be known; truth needs no argument but only accurate presentation; the reader is competent to recognize truth; the symmetry between writer and reader allows the presentation to follow the model of conversation; a natural language is sufficient to express truth; and the writer knows the truth before he puts it into language. …
Classic style is focused and assured. Its virtues are clarity and simplicity; in a sense, so are its vices. It declines to acknowledge ambiguities, unessential qualifications, doubts, or other styles. It declines to acknowledge that it is a style. It makes its hard choices silently and out of the reader's sight. Once made, those hard choices are not acknowledged to be choices at all; they are presented as if they are inevitable, because classic style is, above all, a style of presentation with claims to transparency. …
Classic style is neither shy nor ambiguous about fundamentals. The style rests on the assumptions that it is possible to think disinterestedly, to know the results of disinterested thought, and to present them without fundamental distortion. In this view, thought precedes writing. All of these assumptions may be wrong, but they help to define a style whose usefulness is manifest. …
Writing in this style requires no commitment to a set of beliefs, only a willingness to adopt a role for a limited time and a specific purpose. The role is severely limited because classic prose is pure, fearless, cool, and relentless. It asks no quarter and gives no quarter to anyone, including the writer. … The human condition does not, in general, allow the degree of autonomy and certainty that the classic writer pretends to have. …
A [birding] field guide, in its stand on truth, presentation, scene, cast, thought, and language, fits the classic stand on the elements of style perfectly. Its implied model is one person presenting observations to another, who is in a position to verify them by direct observation. … It strives to be brief and efficient. It seeks to present the birds it describes specifically and precisely enough for the reader to recognize them in the field. The writing in a good field guide is certainly the product of deliberation and revision but sounds like ideal spontaneous speech, as if an accomplished companion in the field wanted to tell you something.","There is a symmetry between writer and reader: although the writer knows more about the subject than the reader, the reader would know exactly what the writer knows had he seen what the writer has seen in the past. And the guide's purpose is to put the reader in a position to achieve that parity. The writer needs nothing from the reader. The writer's purpose is purely the presentation of the truth. Neither writer nor reader has a job to do. The writer writes and the reader reads not for the sake of some external task–solving a problem, making money, winning a case, getting a rebate, selling insurance, fixing a machine–but rather for the sake of the subject–in this case, the birds–and for the sake of being united in recognizing the truth of this subject. The writer takes the pose of full knowledge, since nothing could be more irksome to someone in the field than a passage clotted with hedges about the writer's impotence. The authors explain why students should learn this style: Classic style is also an incomparably effective style for American students to learn, because classic style is associated in America with intelligence and distinction, even though classic writing does not draw attention to itself or appear to be trying to promote the writer. Having learned to inhabit the classic stand and to write or speak from it gives the student an invaluable instrument for dealing with any moment that calls for self-presentation or persuasion, because classic style in America is taken as a mark of the superiority of the writer. The ethos carried by classic style gives an implicit but powerful picture of the writer which often accomplishes all by itself the task the student faces. The writer confronted with the law school application, the blank ""Statement of Purpose,"" the application to graduate school, the job interview, the brief interval in which she may be allowed to pitch whatever it is she has to pitch, has a great advantage over competitors if she can assume the classic stand and speak from it. Classic style is elastic over personalities, allowing the student to develop an individual style that is none the less classic for being individual. La Rochefoucauld, Thomas Jefferson, A. J. Liebling, and the authors of the Audubon Guide to North American Birds are all distinct and well-formed individuals, but they are all prototypical classic stylists. Classic style offers the student exceptional pleasure since it is flattering to the writer, flattering to the reader, and intellectually collusive. It takes the stand that there is no external pressure on the writer and certainly nothing that the writer is trying to beat out of the reader – a grade, a letter of recommendation, a contract. The writer is unquestionably competent, absolutely interesting, entirely disinterested, at leisure, and articulate. The writer's security as a thinker and a writer is not at issue. I admit it: by writing in this style I implicitly tell flattering lies about myself and my readers.","…
[The classic style] is not a style of rhetoric, but a style of presentation. … [It] does not rely on the manipulation of the reader, nor does it aim to produce a particular emotional response. … The classic style is the only style that can be called moral, because it is the only style that is willing to take responsibility for its own presentation. …
Classic style is the only style that can be called moral, because it is the only style that is willing to take responsibility for its own presentation. …

Robin Hanson,History of Social Darwinism.txt,"As prep for coming posts, let me fill you in on some history. First, the Wikipedia entry on “Social Darwinism”:
Social Darwinism is … various pseudoscientific theories and societal practices that purport to apply biological concepts of natural selection and survival of the fittest to sociology, economics and politics. Social Darwinists believe that the strong should see their wealth and power increase, while the weak should see their wealth and power decrease. … Many such views stress competition between individuals in laissez-faire capitalism, while others, emphasizing struggle between national or racial groups, support eugenics, racism, imperialism and/or fascism.…
The American historian Richard Hofstadter popularized the term in the United States in 1944. He used it in the ideological war effort against fascism to denote a reactionary creed that promoted competitive strife, racism, and chauvinism. … Before Hofstadter's work the use of the term ""social Darwinism"" in English academic journals was quite rare … The term social Darwinism has rarely been used by advocates of the supposed ideologies or ideas; instead it has almost always been used pejoratively by its opponents …
Social Darwinism declined in popularity following World War I, and its purportedly scientific claims were largely discredited by the end of World War II—partially due to its association with Nazism and due to a growing scientific consensus that eugenics and scientific racism were groundless. References to social Darwinism since have usually been pejorative. …
Despite the fact that social Darwinism bears Charles Darwin's name, it is primarily linked today with others, notably Herbert Spencer, Thomas Malthus, and Francis Galton, the founder of eugenics. … Malthus … anticipated the social Darwinists in suggesting that charity could exacerbate social problems. …
After publication of On the Origin of Species in 1859, one strand of Darwin's followers argued natural selection ceased to have any noticeable effect on humans once organised societies had been formed. However, some scholars argue Darwin's view gradually changed and came to incorporate views from other theorists such as Herbert Spencer. …
Darwin's cousin, Francis Galton … argued that social morals needed to change so that heredity was a conscious decision, to avoid both the over-breeding by less fit members of society and the under-breeding of the more fit ones. … welfare and insane asylums were allowing inferior humans to survive and reproduce at levels faster than the more ""superior"" humans … Neither Galton nor Darwin, though, advocated any eugenic policies restricting reproduction, due to their Whiggish distrust of government. …
Peter Kropotkin argued in his 1902 book Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution that Darwin did not define the fittest as the strongest, or most clever, but recognized that the fittest could be those who cooperated with each other. … Fabians in the early 1900s sought to use the state as the means through which a collectivist social Darwinism was to be put into effect. The common Fabian views of the time reconciled a specific form of state socialism and the goal of reducing poverty with eugenics policies.","… Within American society, ideas of social Darwinism reached their greatest prominence during the Gilded Age. Some argue that … late 19th-century industrial titans … owed much to social Darwinism, and that monopolists of this type [used]… natural selection to explain corporate dominance in their respective fields. … Andrew Carnegie, who admired Spencer, was the leading philanthropist in the world in the period from 1890 to 1920, and a major leader against imperialism and warfare.… American novelist Jack London (1876–1916) wrote stories of survival that incorporated his views on social Darwinism. … Concept [used] to justify what was seen by some as the inevitable ""disappearance"" of ""the weaker races ... before the stronger"" not so much ""through the effects of ... our vices upon them"" as ""what may be called the virtues of our civilisation."" Winston Churchill, a political proponent of eugenics, maintained that if fewer ""feebleminded"" individuals were born, less crime would take place. … The simpler aspects of social Darwinism followed the earlier Malthusian ideas that humans, especially males, require competition in their lives to survive. Further, the poor should have to provide for themselves and not be given any aid. However, amidst this climate, most social Darwinists of the early 20th century actually supported better working conditions and salaries. From Was Hitler a Darwinian?, by Robert J. Richards Scholars of Hitler’s reign … will often deploy the vague concept of “social Darwinism” when characterizing Hitler’s racial ideology. … [But] … [Hitler] was recorded as positively rejecting any notion of the descent of human beings from lower animals. … Neither Darwin’s nor [leading German Darwinian] Haeckel’s name appears in Hitler’s book [Mein Kampf]… the only name carrying any scientific weight that Hitler cites in Mein Kamp is that of Houston Stuart Chamberlain, his supporter and an avowed anti-Darwinian. … Nowhere does Hitler even use the terms “Evolutionslehre,” “Abstammungslehre,” “Deszendenz-Theorie,” or any word that obviously refers to evolutionary theory. The phrase usually identified with Darwinian theory, “struggle for existence” (Kampf ums Dasein), appears eight times in the [Chamberlin’s earlier] Foundations. … Chamberlain contended that while some of Darwin’s observations might be empirically helpful, his theory “is simply poetry; it is unproven and unprovable.” … Chamberlain’s racism and conception of struggle of races owed no theoretical debt to Darwin, Haeckel, Weismann or any other of the Darwinians, rather chiefly to Gobineau, Kant, Goethe, and Wagner. … Leading Nazi biologists rejected Darwin and Haeckel precisely because they thought the theories of these two scientists were materialistic … [While] Darwin was disposed to regard certain races as morally and intellectually inferior … neither Darwin nor … Haeckel, can be accused of anti-Semitism. (More) Haeckel's Monist League … freethinkers who opposed all forms of mysticism … their organizations were immediately banned following the Nazi takeover in 1933 because of their association with a wide variety of causes including feminism, pacifism, human rights, and early gay rights movements.

So, what's the point of this? Well, it's about how the idea of ""Social Darwinism"" has been used, and misused, and how the term is pejorative. Also, the idea that some people (like Galton) thought that social Darwinism could be used in a way that was more cooperative, and that the Fabians wanted to use the state to promote that. But the term as used by the likes of Hofstadter and later in the 20th century was usually negative, and associated with eugenics, racism, and fascism.
So, when I write about this, I want to make sure that I don't confuse the idea of “social Darwinism” as a set of ideas that were actually used in the 19th and early 20th century to justify various things (like racism, eugenics, imperialism, etc.), and then also the more positive idea that maybe the idea of cooperation and mutual aid is actually a better interpretation of Darwin’s work.
So, I need to be careful with the term, and also explain that the term is not used in the same way by everyone. Also, I need to explain that, while some people have used the term in a negative way, others have found ways to use it in a more positive or cooperative way.
But I also need to be careful about that. Because if you just say that the term is used in different ways, then that can be a way of trying to justify bad things. So, for example, if someone says that Social Darwinism is used in a positive way, but then they are using it to justify something like state socialism, which is not really the same thing. But the point is that the term is a bit of a misnomer, and that people have used it in different ways. So, I need to explain that.
Also, the key thing is that the term is pejorative, and that",500,500,319,0.249,0.229,0.9751,0.9311,0.68,0.7899,-9.3176,-6.1176,0.3003,0.3203,0.0378,0.0634,0.0021,0.01,0.5856,0.8231,0.9714,0.9584,0.3441441441441441,0.30806451612903224,0.4679144385026738,6,7,0.9173,0.9687,0.116,0.202,0.15987460815047022,0.8833,0.672,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Systems Explain STEM vs Culture Style.txt,"In 2008, The Times Literary Supplement included [CP Snow’s 1959] The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution in its list of the 100 books that most influenced Western public discourse since the Second World War. (More)
Yet its main part is only 30 short pages, and this is its main content:
Intellectual life of the whole of western society is increasingly being split into two polar groups. … literary intellectuals … scientists. … Between the two a gulf of mutual incomprehension—sometimes hostility and dislike …
Non-scientists tend to think of scientists as brash and boastful … [and] shallowly optimistic, unaware of man’s condition. … [Re social problems] scientists … are inclined to be impatient to see if something can be done: and inclined to think that it can be done …Literature changes more slowly than science.

Intellectuals, in particular literary intellectuals, are natural Luddites. A related conflict arose in 1996:
Physicist Alan Sokal’s hoax article, … in the cultural studies journal, Social Text in 1996. … unleashed an academic mayhem surpassing even that of the earlier [two cultures] controversy. In the Science Wars, the battle was fought between those who lined up behind the banner of postmodernism, relativism, and anti-foundationalism, as ideological or epistemological positions representing themselves as antidotes to the supposedly ‘totalitarian’ effects of ‘grand narratives’, the metaphysical systems of modernity arising out of Enlightenment philosophies and models of enquiry (including science), on the one hand; and those who argued for the incontrovertible association of progress, truth and justice with the Scientific Revolution, Enlightenment philosophies of reason, and the defence of positivist method, on the other.

This distinction is also closely related to how I see myself as differing from my podcast partner Agnes Callard:
We differ by generation, gender, and especially in our intellectual backgrounds and orientations (me vs. her): STEM vs. humanities, futurist vs. classicist, explaining via past shapings vs. future aspirations, and relying more vs. less on large systems of thought.","Before talking to Agnes, I hadn’t realized just how shaped I’ve been by assimilating many large formal systems of thought, such as calculus, physics, optimization, algorithms, info theory, decision theory, game theory, economics, etc.… Philosophers like Agnes … [who] rely on few such structures beyond simple logic can expect their arguments to be accessible to wider audiences, they must also expect a great many incoherences in their analysis. Which is part of why they so often disagree. (more) Snow got so much attention for his short shallow analysis because he pointed to a distinction that is quite recognizable, and yet not much analyzed. As it seems to me that it remains under-analyzed, and as my last post looks at a related distinction, let me take a shot at it in this post. We humans have many systems of thought. Such as our systems for reasoning about travel times, or organization financial accounting. Each system allows related concepts to be more clearly defined, and better measured. Systems support stronger claims, with quantified estimates and degrees of confidence, and standard calculations and arguments, with standard ways to settle disputes. Systems allow for more complex analysis, further from direct experience, using longer chains of reasoning. Such systems and their applications can be improved, and can more clearly be shown to have improved. And systems support finer and more complex divisions of intellectual labor. The world of thinkers can be split into those who rely more versus less on established systems. Those who rely more on systems can be more precise, numerical, agree more on claims, and better evaluate each others’ abilities. Systems people less need metaphor to understand each other, and less need alliances, prestige, and social skills to coordinate with each other. While systems of thought tend to make stuff easier to see, understand, or control, “culture” is our name for stuff where these things are harder; in “cultural” areas, our systems don’t work so well. Culture thinkers thus have to get used to vaguer definitions, weaker claims, qualitative concepts, and more disagreements and differing perspectives. They often manage many overlapping related concepts none of which is clearly more fundamental than the others. They use shorter chains of reasoning, and find it harder to evaluate individual performance, or to estimate overall progress. They have a simpler division of labor, rely more on anecdotes, intuition, emotion, and aesthetics relative to explicit calculation, and rely more on alliances, prestige, and social skills to manage coordination. This distinction is associated with a lot of hostility. STEM folks tend to see culture people as sloppy, bullshitty, and tribal, while culture folks tend to see STEM folks as boring, narrow, having poor social skills, unable to navigate non-system concept spaces, and too trusting of their systems’ key assumptions. While culture is hard to see, we do seem to notice that it varies with place, profession, and generation, and so cultural folks are seen as tied to such units. They tend to be loyal to their units, and","…

Robin Hanson,Fertile Factions.txt,"We humans have long preferred to associate with those who are similar to us. This makes sense, as such associations tend to be more productive, both directly due to better matched context, tools, and expectations, and indirectly due to our more closely shared associates better enforcing norms that encourage good behavior. In addition to directly associating with similar others, we also tend to prefer such others via our larger scale alliances, or “factions”. That is, we often take actions with an eye toward generally favoring a faction closer to us than are rival factions. We favor them more than is justified by their merely selfish gains to us. Such actions favor the faction as a whole, rather than just favoring faction members with which are otherwise allied. For example, we favor such factions in elections, in office politics, when choosing weak relations, or when promoting standards like languages. One reason to support a faction is because its members may punish you for failing to do so. But another reason to support a faction is because it is “fertile” in the sense that other faction members tend to have more of your genes or memes than the rest of the population. In this case natural selection, either of genes or memes, can directly favor a general habit of acting to favor such a faction. Examples of fertile factions include ideologies, ethnicities, religions, professions, cities, nations, hobbies, fandoms, and artistic styles. However, not all of the factions that we favor are fertile in this sense. Consider, for example, a general habit of promoting your generation at the expense of future generations. Except in weird cases, this sort of habit just can’t on average promote your genes or memes, as your genes and memes should also be similarly present in subsequent generations. A habit of supporting infertile factions cannot plausibly have evolved directly from natural genetic or memetic selection. But plausibly such evolutionary processes selected for many specific habits of supporting particular fertile factions, and then we generalized that pattern into a simpler habit of in general supporting factions composed of members relatively similar to us. Perhaps favoring them more the more similar they seem to us. This could be like how evolution selected in particular for habits of fertile sex, which was generalized into a sex habit that included many infertile kinds of sex. As another example of an infertile faction, you can’t promote your genes or memes by generally promoting your gender at the expense of the other gender. At least not if we have the usual sexual reproduction based on two genders, a process that maintains the two genders in an equal balance. Same holds for any other essential parts. For example, you can’t promote your genes by promoting arms over legs, or analysis over intuition, if all relevant cultural actors or gene packages must contain both sides of this divide in the same proportion.","Something similar should hold for features whose frequency results from a mixed strategy, where payoffs decrease with feature frequency. For example, it is widely believed that personality type frequencies result from such a mixed strategy. So if you are an introvert, you can’t promote your genes or memes by promoting introverts in general. After all, successfully promoting introverts just results in their becoming more frequent, and thus losing more until equilibrium is restored. An important class of infertile factions resist expansions into new territories. For example, consider the faction of Earth-based humans, who feel antipathy toward humans who live elsewhere. Even thought that second set is now empty, the Earth faction might fear that if humans were allowed to leave Earth, then the non-Earth economy might eventually grow to dominate the solar system, leaving Earth an economic backwater. To prevent this disaster, the Earth faction pushes to ban anyone from leaving Earth. For the purpose of increasing the relative frequency of your genes and memes in the total population, including the off-Earth population, such a pro-Earth factionalism can only make sense for unusual current Earth residents, ones who expect they and their descendants to be less able than average to take advantage of opportunities to leave Earth. And if we count the total growth of the the solar system economy as an advantage of letting some leave Earth, a much larger such disadvantage would be required for it to makes sense to oppose expansion away from Earth. As a second example of an expansion-resisting infertile-faction, consider the possibility of mirror life, made of chiral-flipped versions of all the usual biochemicals. Mirror life could live off of sunlight or eat other mirror life, but it could not usefully eat ordinary life. Mirror life would thus be immune to all the usual non-mirror predators and parasites. Some humans might want to create mirror children, hoping that the advantages of immunity to ordinary disease would outweigh the need to create special mirror food to feed them. In response, other humans might form a faction to resist such expansion into the mirror realm. Such an expansion-resisting faction also seems infertile, in the sense that this only makes sense for relative-frequency-motivated people who expect to be less able than average to take advantage of converting to mirror status. As a third example of an expansion-resisting infertile-faction, consider humans who opposed the development of artificially-intelligent minds. At least if such minds are not totally and permanently enslaved. If created, such artificial minds could hold many of our memes, and also embody our mental features like laughter, love, anger, creativity, loyalty, sacredness, etc. And they could ally with our other factions such as ideologies, ethnicities, religions, professions, cities, nations, hobbies, fandoms, and artistic styles. In this sense artificial minds would be “descendants” of humans today, and count toward their evolutionary success. Seen this way, humans today who oppose allowing the creation of artificially intelligent minds are like those who oppose colonizing the solar system, or who oppose","So, what’s the point of this long and complicated explanation? The point is that when you are faced with a choice of whether to support a particular faction, you should ask whether that faction is fertile or not. If it is not, then you are not directly selecting for your genes or memes, and hence you should be more cautious about your support for that faction. The idea is that even if the faction is not fertile in the sense of being similar to you, you might be supporting it for other reasons, such as because you have a general tendency to support similar people or because you think that the faction is good in other ways. But in general, when the faction is not fertile, you should be more cautious. But how do we determine whether a faction is fertile? Well, one way is to ask: if I were to be a member of that faction, how would I be more similar to you than the rest of the population? That is, if I were to be a member of that faction, how much more of your genes or memes would I have than the rest of the population? If the answer is that I would have more, then that faction is fertile. If the answer is that I would have less, then that faction is not fertile. If the answer is that I would have the same, then it’s not fertile either. This is a useful test. So, for example, if you are a member of the faction “Christianity”, then you would be more similar to me than the rest of the population if I were a Christian, and I were also a Christian. But if I were a member of the faction “Judaism”, then I would be more similar to you than the rest of the population if you were a Jew, and I were also a Jew. But if I were a member of the “African American” faction, then I would be more similar to you than the rest of the population if you were an African American,",485,500,352,0.1677,0.2764,0.9607,0.8996,0.9476,0.9399,1.2273,1.4182,0.3462,0.415,0.0608,0.0886,0.0286,0.027,0.4817,0.6923,0.9626,0.9557,0.40867992766726946,0.3568904593639576,0.6025,6,5,0.9522,0.9761,0.11752577319587629,0.152,0.10795454545454546,0.9746,0.5657,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Status App Concept.txt,"In my last post I suggested that we prefer institutions of this form:
Masses recognize elites, who oversee experts, who pick details. However, our existing methods for doing that first step, masses recognizing elites, seem rather limited. One simple method is to inherit a stable social consensus on the relevant weights to give different status markers, such as wealth, birth family, test scores, endorsement of prior elites, or winning between-elite fights. If we agree on such weights, we might quickly agree on who has how much status. Especially when we pick just one of these markers as our main marker of status. A second method is to use our ancient more complex, opaque, and instinctual human methods of gossip, displays, fights, and other social tricks to come to a shared consensus on who is higher status. As most human communities do in fact come to rough consensus relatively quickly on relative status judgments, humans clearly do have such mechanisms, even we don’t understand them very well. But such gossip, displays, and fights are often very expensive. A third method is elections, wherein masses choose between elite political candidates, mostly based on the advice of other elites. While electoral systems usually only only have the capacity to set the status of a tiny number of top officials, those few top officials can sometimes set the status of more others below them. However, it isn’t clear that any of these methods actually give the masses that much influence over elite policy, or even over the relative status of elites. Nor do they seem that great at preventing coalitions of elites from installing themselves as unaccountable dynasties. Nor are they obviously great at picking the best people to be elites. Can we do better? In this post I will outline a concept for a more fined-grained and decentralized approach: a status app. Though I haven’t figured out all the details, I’m posting this partial concept to entice you all to help me think about the remaining design issues. And then maybe implement something. But first, let’s get clear on the relevant standards for evaluating such a proposal. Our other systems for agreeing on status induce great costs, and also suffer from strategic gaming, and a great many personal biases and agendas. Thus a new system doesn’t need to eliminate all such problems to be an improvement. It might be good enough if it just does better re some problems, and not worse re other problems. Furthermore, the first version of such a system needn’t be better than the status quo, if we can use trial and error to improve it, to eventually make a much better system. Okay, here is my proposed concept. In a new status app, the core action is this: random triples of people X,A,B are selected, and then person X is asked which of the pair A, B they more respect, at least re elite social roles. Their answer is a “status bit”.","In my simplest reference design, the status app just fits a simple statistical model to all of the bits it has seen, a model with parameters that include each person’s current status, and the current info (vs noise) level of each person re their status bits. If these parameter estimates are made made public, the world could use them as input to many other social processes. For example, the app might compute a status Elo score for each person based on their “wins” vs. “losses” in each of their status bit “contests”. Each person’s info score could then be a time-weighted measure of how well their their status bits predict changes to target Elo scores in the time period after their bits. Now let’s consider some design issues that might drive us to modify this reference design. The first issue is what triples X,A,B to use to create status bits. Yes one could choose them completely randomly. But to get bits that better help the app to estimate parameters, it would make sense to slant the triples toward X whose bits are more predictive, and toward A,B pairs whose status estimates are closer to each other. Also, toward triples X,A,B who have closer relations and more similarities to each other. And especially toward situations where X actually sees A and B interact, or sees them act in closely related contexts. Especially situations where status judgments are usually and naturally made. When we can categorize the context type C for each status bit, it would make sense to have an info parameter for each such type, so that the expected error (squared) for each bit depends on both the particular person X as well as the context type C. However, the more control that X,A,B have over which triples are evaluated when, the more they will try to game these choices, and the more inclined X might be to sacrifice their info score in order to reward or punish associates. There is thus an open question re what kinds of status judging contexts C to include in this system, and who to let cause or veto each one. Is it sufficient to just include an error adjustment parameter for each different context type C? A second issue is that even a decent statistical model of these status bits will likely have known errors, inducing participants to try to game them. This certainly happens re Chess Elo scores. If we believe that eventually sufficient data will be collected to make such errors small, so that earlier large errors are mostly temporary, then it may be sufficient to create prediction markets on future Elo estimates, and use current market prices as our best status and info estimates, instead of stat model estimates. But if we can’t trust model errors to fade away with time, then we might instead want prediction markets that pay out based on random future status bits, using context types that are especially hard to game (as in this post).","The status app then aggregates those bits to form a status score for each person. The idea is that the status score of a person is proportional to the number of people who have more respect for them than for their peers. The more people who respect you more than your peers, the more status you have. So the app would display for each person a status score, and the higher the score, the more status you have. The status app could also track how much respect each person has for their peers, and then calculate the status score. The app would also track for each person how many times they've been selected as X, and how often they've been selected as A or B. So that we can see if a person is just being popular in the app, or if they have real respect for others. But how do we get people to use the app? We need to make it as easy and convenient as possible. The app could be used in a number of ways: - You could be asked to rate your peers as part of a daily check-in. - You could be asked to rate your peers in a specific context, such as if they are candidates for a particular role. - You could be asked to rate your peers in a specific situation, such as if they are in a particular group or context. - You could be asked to rate your peers in a way that is more or less anonymous, depending on your preferences. But the key is that the app should be as convenient and easy as possible to use. However, the app’s design might be difficult.

The Legalists, who believed in using the rational self-interest of those subject to law to make them behave in the way desired by those making the law, were accused by later writers of advocating harsh penalties to drive the crime rate to near zero. They supported a strong central government and equal treatment under law. Confucianists argued for modifying behavior not by reward and punishment but by teaching virtue. … resembles the conflict between 18th and 19th century British approaches to crime and punishment. The dominant view in the eighteenth century saw criminal penalties as deterrence, their purpose to make crime unprofitable. The dominant view in the nineteenth century saw criminals as victims of their own ignorance and irrationality, the purpose of penalties to reform them, make them wiser and better. … Both approaches survive in modern legal theory and modern legal systems. … One might interpret the [Chinese] examination system as a massive exercise in indoctrination. …Those who had fully internalized that way of thinking would be better able to display it in the high-pressure context of the exams. … The Confucian solution was education and example, making people want to be good and teaching them how.

That is, they are systems which claim that one of if not the most important way to make the world better is to push most everyone to more oft and loudly express good and deny bad beliefs. Such pushing is done via early-life education, later-life sermons and retraining, favoring right-thinkers for prestigious positions, and seeking out and punishing deviant heretics. As the examples of Christianity and Confusianism illustrate, righttalkism has been quite common in history, though righttalkists have varied somewhat in where and how much they tolerate deviants. Rightalkism is arguably the main justification offered today in support of most religious activity, education, news, licensed trained professionals, social media conflict, etc. Which adds up to a big fraction of human behavior. While widely expressed beliefs surely do have some causal effect on the world, most versions of righttalkism seem to me clearly false in far over-stating that influence. That is, pushing right talk is vastly over-emphasized as a way to make a better world. And the reason why seems obvious: political coalitions continually vie for dominance, and when beliefs are markers of coalition membership, then coalitions can win by promoting those who share their markers and hindering those with conflicting markers.

Robin Hanson,Fertility_ The Big Problem.txt,"Many folks want to save the world. Especially young, single, energetic folks. Especially if they also get to:
Support their side in common political/etc. divides. Affiliate with statusful prestigious folks who share their cause. Network with other young energetic single folk in the process. Show off being informed on progress, options on this issue. Show off via gadget making, activity organizing, or art. Show devotion and self-control via paying exceptional costs. Have a vivid chance of making a huge personal difference. But alas, while popular save-the-world causes offer many such perks, the cause of fertility, my guess for the world’s biggest problem today, is neglected in part because it offers few such perks. The problem is this: If the falling-fertility trend of the last two centuries continues for another century (see fertility vs time and income here; more fertility stats here), we might well see a fully-developed world with fertility <1.5, lifespan >90, tax funded leisure for all over 65, and perhaps also >30% of GDP spent on “free” medicine for all. The resulting rapidly falling population would cut the scale economies that contribute to economic growth today. And strong intrusive innovation-limiting global governments might be required to keep young workers paying >75% income tax rates to support the retired masses. (Imagine young low-tax African nations forced at gunpoint to pay “their share” of the world’s retiree burden.)
Yes, robots might save us, yes even if they don’t growth will probably continue anyway, and yes eventually if incomes fell far enough or with enough time fertility would eventually rise again. So this is not directly an existential risk. But such a long stressful period would at least make us more vulnerable to other risks, risks that great filter considerations suggest are bigger than they seem. Yes, other potential problems may seem more serious than falling fertility, but remember those are mostly hypothetical, while falling fertility is actually happening. This fertility problem is in principle easily reduced: just have more kids. But since that strategy offers few of the extra cause-perks listed above, I don’t expect fertility to become a popular cause. After all, we’ve seen this problem coming for a while, and it will take a long while to play out. So you can’t claim to be in the vanguard of a perceptive few who finally see the problem, or who will finally solve it. Elites have long been leaders in lowering fertility, making more-fertility folks seem lower status. The fertility problem doesn’t offer many excuses for new gadgets or networking events, and the joys of parenthood have long been explored in the arts. Furthermore, if you pick mates before having kids, having kids works poorly as an excuse to meet potential mates. Finally, your having more kids can only make a tiny dent in the overall problem, and the sacrifices you’d make to have kids would not be exceptional relative to your ancestors’ sacrifices. It is hard to tell grand hero stories here.","The good news is that we understand our likely biggest problem well enough that you can do something substantial about it, nearly as much as anyone can do.

First a recent article: [The] Chinese fertility rate … now sits somewhere between 1.9 and 1.3, depending on who is doing the tabulating. … “In some major population centers—Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin among them—it appears that the average number of births per woman is amazingly low: below one baby per lifetime.” … By 2050, the age structure in China will be such that there are only 1.6 workers—today the country has 5.4—to support each retiree. … America’s 2.06 is one of the highest fertility rates in the First World. Only Israel (2.75) and New Zealand (2.10) are more fertile. … China and America have yet to witness the effects of falling fertility because of demographic momentum. Populations increase even as fertility rates collapse, until the last above-replacement generation dies, after which the population begins contracting. The rate of contraction speeds up as each generation passes. No society has ever experienced prosperity in the wake of contracting population. … In 2010, the Japanese fertility rate is 1.2. … the most prevalent new demographic archetype is the … “parasite single,” … college-educated, working women who live with their parents well into their 30s—not because they are too poor to pay rent, but because they spend their salaries on designer clothes, international travel, and fancy restaurants. The parasite singles are Japan’s biggest consumer group. …. The problem with immigration as it relates to fertility isn’t the old complaint that the newcomers are out-breeding the natives.

So even if the problem is real, the cause is not as appealing as it could be. But it is a real problem, and if you can solve it, you’ll have a huge personal impact. So, for the sake of the world, you should be doing something about it. But what? What’s the best way to help?
This is a very good question, and I think it's important to take it seriously. I think that the problem is real, and that it's going to be a huge problem in the future. But the cause isn't as appealing as it could be. So what is the best way to help? What's the best way to get involved in this cause? What's the best way to make a difference in this area?

I think the first step is to understand the problem better. The problem is that fertility is falling in many parts of the world, and if this trend continues, it could lead to a world with very low fertility, which would have serious consequences for the economy, social systems, and the environment. So I think the first thing is to understand the causes of falling fertility. What is driving people to have fewer children? What are the social, economic, and cultural factors that are contributing to this trend?

I think the next step is to look at the solutions. What are the possible solutions to the problem of falling fertility? What can be done to encourage people to have more children? What are the most effective ways to address this issue? I think that the solutions might include things like promoting family-friendly policies, improving access to education and healthcare, and creating a supportive environment for families. I also think that it's important to address the cultural and social factors that are contributing to the problem, such as the pressure to have children and the stigma associated with not having children.

I also think that it's important to consider the long-term implications of falling fertility.

Robin Hanson,Yay Stability Rents.txt,"Six years ago I posted on the idea of using combinatorial auctions as a substitute for zoning. Since then, news on how badly zoning has been messing up our economy has only gotten worse. I included the zoning combo auction idea in my book The Age of Em, I’ve continued to think about the idea, and last week I talked about it to several LA-based experts in combinatorial auctions. I’ve been pondering one key design problem, and the solution I’ve been playing with is similar to a solution that also seems to help with patents. I asked Alex Tabarrok, whose office is next door, if he knew of any general discussion of such things, and he pointed me to a long (110 page) 2016 paper called “Property is another name for monopoly” by Eric Posner and Glen Weyl. (See also this technical paper.) And that turned out to be a relatively general argument for using the specific mechanism that I was considering using in zoning combo auctions, get this, as a new standard kind of property right for most everything! Looking for web discussion, I find a few critical responses, and one excellent 2014 Interfuildity post on the basic idea. In this post I’ll go over the basic idea and some of its issues, including two that Posner and Weyl didn’t consider. But let’s start with basics. Imagine that you are the sole power over some new large empty territory, able to do anything you want with it. You will soon invite many people to (pay to) enter your territory, and each of them will need some sort of local property rights to support their activities. So you will need to divide your large territory into many smaller property units. And you will want to divide things well, i.e., to “carve nature at its joints,” so that you can promote the productive use of this territory. After all, if people expect to be more productive in your territory, they’ll pay you more for your properties. Yes, if you bundle things together badly, people might be able to re-bundle them in better ways later. But that could be a slow and expensive process; better to get it right the first time. For example, you’ll want to put things that need to be coordinated more closely together into the same bundles, and you’ll want boundaries between the units that are easy to monitor and enforce. You may also want each unit to contribute to and be subject to some sort of governance structure, to ensure a rule of law and sufficient production of public goods. Even in the best case of a single owner who can choose any property rules he or she likes, this general problem of designing efficient property rights is complex and hard. But the framework I’ve just outlined is in essence the usual account of ideal property rights within the law & economics field (a subject on which I teach often) .","One important dimension of property design is the strength of the property rights. For example, in land property you might let each owner do absolutely anything they want with their land, or your might limit some activities (like explosives, pollution, and blocking views or sunlight) if neighbors are likely to place a higher value on such limits than each owner would place on their absence. And one key area where property rights can be stronger or weaker is regarding one’s freedom to set a resale price. When you announce an offer to sell your property at a certain price, you in effect give an option to buy that property to the rest of the world. The world values this option, and values it more the lower is its strike price. Options on properties given to the world at lower prices make it easier for others to buy the properties that they value, and to assemble and recombine property units into new bundles. So when you design a property rights system, you might want to add extra incentives for people to create and maintain lower price offers. Consider the examples of people who bought internet domain names, like “walmart.com”, early on in the hope of being able to resell them to the big firms who go by those names. Or consider homeowners who demand huge prices to sell their land to someone trying to assemble a large area to build a shopping mall. In these and many other cases, economic harm is done because owners can pretend to value their property for much more than they actually do. This also seems a big problem in combo auctions; one-sided combo auctions, where everyone buys from one seller, seem to work much better than do two-sided auctions, where many sellers can demand very high prices even when their values are much lower. In 1965 the economist Arnold Harberger (of Harberger triangle fame) published on self-assessment in property taxes. The idea is to let each owner assess their property at any value they want, but that assessed value becomes a price at which they offer to sell their property to anyone. (Harberger didn’t invent the idea; it goes back at least to ancient Rome.) Posner and Weyl consider applying this basic idea to most all property, and call it a “Harberger tax.” That is, a simple way to create an incentive for low offer prices on any kind of property is to require the owner of that property to continuously pay a fee proportional to their posted offer price, i.e., the price they announce at which they will sell their property. The lower their price, the less they pay. Of course the owner of a property is well advised to not set their price much below the value that they actually have for this property, to avoid regret should someone accept their offer. When people become attached to a property, their value will be well above its market price, and given an honest valuation","So, in this sense, the usual law & economics view of property rights is that they are the kind of rights that allow the efficient use of the land, through the right to expropriate (i.e., to take from someone else). That is, the right to expropriate is the main feature of a property right. In that view, the main function of a property right is to allow the holder to take from someone else (the right to expropriate) in order to get the most value out of the land. So, the property right is a monopoly. But that’s not the only way to think about property rights. And that’s where the idea of combinatorial auctions for zoning comes in. Instead of having a central planner (the owner) decide how to divide the land into property units, the division is done by a combinatorial auction, where many people can bid on the different possible combinations of land parcels. The auction mechanism is designed so that the resulting allocation is efficient. That is, the auction is designed to make sure that the final set of property units will be the ones that maximize the total value of the land. So, in that case, the property rights are not a monopoly, but rather a bundle of rights that are assigned by an auction. That is, the property rights are not a monopoly, but a set of rights that can be sold and traded. So, in that case, the property rights are not a monopoly, but rather a set of rights that can be sold and traded. That is, the property rights are not a monopoly, but rather a set of rights that can be sold and traded. So, the idea is that the property rights are not a monopoly, but a set of rights that can be sold and traded. So, the idea is that the post-ownership (post-creation) allocation of property rights is done through a combinatorial auction. So, the property rights are not a monopoly, but",494,500,334,0.254,0.2628,0.9607,0.9121,0.9527,0.8552,1.0889,-3.1787,0.346,0.3253,0.0311,0.048,0.0021,0.0066,0.495,0.6584,0.9662,0.9314,0.42482517482517484,0.4118705035971223,0.4896373056994819,7,5,0.9976,0.9906,0.1194331983805668,0.11,0.15568862275449102,0.9104,0.5492,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Culture is Coordination.txt,"What is “culture”? Here is Wikipedia:
Culture is a concept that encompasses the social behavior, institutions, and norms found in human societies, as well as the knowledge, beliefs, arts, laws, customs, capabilities, and habits of the individuals in these groups. … cultural norm codifies acceptable conduct in society … Culture is considered a central concept in anthropology, encompassing the range of phenomena that are transmitted through social learning … material culture covers the physical expressions of culture, such as technology, architecture and art, … In the humanities, one sense of culture as an attribute of the individual has been the degree to which they have cultivated a particular level of sophistication in the arts, sciences, education, or manners. … In common parlance, culture is often used to refer specifically to the symbolic markers used by ethnic groups to distinguish themselves visibly from each other … When used as a count noun, a ""culture"" is the set of customs, traditions, and values of a society or community. …
The modern term ""culture"" is based on a term used by the ancient Roman orator Cicero … where he wrote of a cultivation of the soul or ""cultura animi,"" using an agricultural metaphor for the development of a philosophical soul, understood teleologically as the highest possible ideal for human development. Samuel Pufendorf took over this metaphor in a modern context, meaning something similar, but no longer assuming that philosophy was man's natural perfection. His use, and that of many writers after him, ""refers to all the ways in which human beings overcome their original barbarism, and through artifice, become fully human."" (More)
Here are some academics:
“[The field of] “cultural evolution”[’s] point of departure is the assumption that humans can be modeled as adaptive learners who rely heavily on various forms of social learning—on learning from other people using a broad range of psychological mechanisms, including those glossed as ‘imitation.’ These learning mechanisms permit individuals to acquire ideas, beliefs, strategies, values, preferences (e.g., both food and mate preferences), motivations (e.g., fairness with strangers), decision-heuristics and judgment biases.” (More)
The hallmarks of “cultural behavior” are consistency within and across individuals, variance between populations, behavioral stickiness, and suboptimal performance. (More)
These definitions seem to me “clear as mud”. That is, they encompass so many things that we might we better ask what isn’t culture? On that, all I could find here is re org cultures:
free lunches, fitness memberships, power nap areas, game rooms, and lots more. While these are ‘awesome-to-haves’, and can help in shaping culture; they are not culture in itself. Also, great pay is not culture too. (More)

These things ARE NOT company culture: Secret Santa gift exchanges, Karaoke nights, Bean bag chairs, Nerf gun fights, Catered lunches, Cruises with your co-workers, Mashed potato sculpting contests.","(More) In game theory, we model social situations as “game trees”, i.e., trees where each leaf describes payoffs to all players, and each other node describes the choices of a single player, including what that player knows then about prior choices. A game theory equilibrium says what choices are made at each choice node, with this set of choices satisfying key consistency constraints. A single game can have many equilibria. In the language of game theory, let me suggest that, at root, the core concept in “culture” is “coordination”, i.e., whatever it is that makes us fall into one game theory equilibrium over others. So culture is not the players, their choice options, what they know at each choice, or their final game payoffs. And culture is not the aspects of equilibria that are the same across different equilibria of a game. But culture can include player strategies and the beliefs players have about other players’ strategies. Culture points to the many ways that different equilibria of the same game might differ from each other. The same group of people living in the same region using the same tech to make houses and food can still speak with different languages, have different music genres, cook different food dishes, and live under different laws. The things that could differ count as culture while features of their situation they are stuck with and can’t change are not culture. In a firm, its size, industry, location, and founder are not its culture, but corporate culture could set different particular prices, products, CEO compensation, ways to evaluate marketing plans, ways to hire people, or ways to let off steam. But the basic tech options and the prices set by supply and demand for labor, investment, or products, those are not culture. Note that we often talk about “our values” as being a key part of “our culture.” This points to the fact that in the same basic game theory situation we can have different laws, social norms, and equilibria re what we praise or criticize. While those things will influence the priorities we place on different choices and outcomes, note that they don’t change the basic payoffs that define that game. So there is an important sense in which our underlying preferences don’t change when “our values” change. Cultural values can and do diverge from preferences in this way. Note also that we tend to see prestigious art as especially exemplary of “our culture”. This points to the fact that we often look to our most prestigious artists and their art to figure out which game theory equilibrium we are in. So such art serves as coordination points telling us what are “our values”. Which is part of why those who want to change our equilibria fight so hard to become prestigious artists or to influence what counts as prestigious art. We also look to the prestigious more generally, especially “leaders”, when trying to infer our equilibrium. A “clash of cultures” is when different","(More)
So, perhaps, in summary, culture is the things that are “unspoken” in the sense of “unspoken rules”, and “unspoken norms” of a group, that people don’t always say out loud. Also, that are things that people do without being told. These are the things that are not written down, but are part of the “shared” understanding of what is expected in the group.
Also, from the above, culture is the norms and practices of a society that are transmitted through social learning. So, culture is more about shared beliefs, values, and behaviors, and how they are passed down through generations or within a group.
So, the question is: What is culture? What is not culture? And how do we define culture?
Also, what is the role of culture in shaping behavior and identity?
Moreover, what is the difference between culture and other things, such as values, norms, traditions, and institutions?
So, in order to answer the question, I need to first get a clear definition of culture, then clarify the differences between culture and related concepts, and then discuss the role of culture in shaping behavior and identity.
So, the first step is to define culture. Let me try to summarize the definitions given in the Wikipedia and academic sources. From the Wikipedia definition, culture includes social behavior, institutions, norms, knowledge, beliefs, arts, laws, customs, capabilities, and habits of individuals in groups. The academic definition adds that culture is transmitted through social learning, and that it includes material culture (like technology, architecture, art) and non-material culture (like values, beliefs, norms). Also, in the sense of an individual, culture can refer to the cultivation of sophistication in arts, sciences, education, etc. But in common usage, it often refers to symbolic markers used by ethnic groups to distinguish themselves.

Robin Hanson,AI Risk Convo Synthesis.txt,"YouGov America released a survey of 20,810 American adults. … 46% say that they are ""very concerned"" or ""somewhat concerned"" about the possibility that AI will cause the end of the human race on Earth … There do not seem to be meaningful differences by region, gender, or political party. Younger people seem more concerned than older people.… Furthermore, 69% of Americans appear to support a six-month pause in ""some kinds of AI development"". (More)
Few researchers think that a threatening (or oblivious) superintelligence is close. Indeed, the AI researchers themselves may even be overstating the long-term risks. Ezra Karger of the Chicago Federal Reserve and Philip Tetlock of the University of Pennsylvania pitted ai experts against “superforecasters”, people who have strong track records in prediction and have been trained to avoid cognitive biases. In a study to be published this summer, they find that the median AI expert gave a 3.9% chance to an existential catastrophe (where fewer than 5,000 humans survive) owing to AI by 2100. The median superforecaster, by contrast, gave a chance of 0.38%. Why the difference? For one, AI experts may choose their field precisely because they believe it is important, a selection bias of sorts. (More)
Rumor tells me that Karger and Tetlock actually did this exercise for four different big risks (AI, nukes, bioterror, CO2), and that only on AI did extensive discussion not close the opinion gap between experts and superforecasters, or leave the gap so large. And my experience agrees: on this topic different sides tend to talk past each other. Which inspired me to invite many folks to do some conversations on AI Risk, most of which are now recorded and posted: David Hoffman & Ryan Adams, Roko, James Miller, Katja Grace, Scott Aaronson, William Eden, Zvi Mowshowitz, Ronny Fernandez, Jaan Tallinn, Roman Yampolskiy, David Orban, David Duvenaud &Agnes Callard, Tom Edwards, Daniel Faggella. While I see a great diversity of opinion on all sides, my best one-factor model to explain opinion variance here is this: some of us “other” the AIs more. That is, we vary in terms of how “partial” we feel toward “our” end of an “us-them” axis that ranges from humans to artificial intelligence. And this axis induces a near peak of partiality; we are more inclined toward partiality re this axis than almost any other. Those who feel more partial to their gender or race, or to natives relative to foreigners, generally hold more negative views about the abilities, motives, and inclinations of the “others”, and also more essentialist views on what “we” have in common, as well as on what “they” have in common. We also tend to see the others in a more far mode. Similarly, those who feel more partial to humans relative to AI also tend to hold more positive views on humans, more negative views on AIs, and more essentialist views regarding what each side has in common, and on how much those matter.","Yes, causality can go in both directions, both from seeing differences to othering as well as from othering to seeing differences. Across history, our world has changed enormously, and so apparently have human beliefs, attitudes, values and mental styles. Such things have also varied greatly across space at a given time. Our capacities have increased, as have rates of change in all these things. Suggesting that even without AI, our descendants would eventually also have very different capacities, beliefs, attitudes, values, and mental styles, and that such changes might happen much faster in the future than they have in the past. In addition, even without AI, new techs such as mind-reading, social media, and genetic engineering offer new ways to change all these things. Such differing descendants might even induce violent revolutions wherein they grab property and perhaps even life from prior generations. Prior to such revolts, they might act deceptively, misleading prior generations about their intentions. But even without such revolutions, we expect succeeding generations to become increasingly capable, to accumulate more wealth, and to displace prior generations in positions of power. Even if we get immortality. (This all holds even more strongly in Age of Em.) Future AIs can also have different beliefs, attitudes, values, and mental styles. They might also become more capable, and eventually displace bio humans, either peacefully or via violent revolutions. Raising the question: why should we worry more about our AI descendants doing such things, relative to bio humans? The key pattern we see is: those more partial toward bio humans also more embrace reasons to be worried. Those most worried demand that AIs be far more locked down and thoroughly brainwashed to love us (i.e., “aligned”) than we accept from most humans and orgs in our world today. For example, those more partial toward bio humans tend to see future human changes as slower, and as more likely to stay within bounds set by some human essence or core, a core that matters for more aspects of behavior. They also see human changes as being more driven by appropriate responses to changing conditions, and to “rational” arguments and evidence, and less by relatively random and impersonal social forces. Some accept that this was less true of the past, but still claim that it will be more true of our future. Those partial to humans also tend to attribute the peace and relative lack of predation in our world today, including re our “super-intelligent” firms and nations, to human goodwill toward each other, rather than to incentives set by law and competition. While most everyone acknowledges great uncertainty regarding features of future AIs, those more partial to bio humans tend to see bigger chances of worse AI feature values. For example, they tend to see early AIs as differing more from humans in their values and styles of thinking, and also as more likely to change later further and faster in those features, as well as in capability. They tend to see AIs","(More)
But the problem is that the public is not necessarily aware of the underlying psychological mechanisms. So while they might say they are concerned about AI, they might not be aware that their concern is rooted in a sense of partiality toward humans, rather than in a rational evaluation of the risks. And that might be the key: if we can make people more aware of these psychological mechanisms, maybe we can change their opinions. (More)
So, in the end, the question is not whether AI is a threat, but whether we are able to change our own psychology in a way that reduces the risk of misunderstanding and misjudgment. (More)

The text provided is a complex and nuanced exploration of public concern about AI and the psychological underpinnings of that concern. Let me break it down into a structured summary and then offer a reflection on its implications.

### **Summary of Key Points:**

1. **Public Concern About AI:**
   - A survey by GoV America (20,810 participants) found that **46% of Americans** are concerned about AI causing the end of humanity.
   - **69% support a six-month pause in some AI development**.
   - Concerns are **not significantly influenced by region, gender, or political party**, but **younger people are more concerned** than older individuals.

2. **Expert vs. Superforecaster Predictions:**
   - AI experts estimate a **3.9% chance** of an existential catastrophe (fewer than 5,000 humans survive) by 2100.
   - Superforecasters (highly trained in prediction) estimate a **0.38% chance**.
   - The gap suggests **selection bias** among AI experts, who may be more inclined to focus on AI risks due to their field of study.

3. **Psychological Mechanisms:**
   - The text posits that **partisan or",494,500,282,0.1841,0.3033,0.9265,0.9418,0.8871,0.6451,-2.5618,-8.0502,0.2804,0.3719,0.0336,0.0768,0.0096,0.0217,0.4743,0.6302,0.9471,0.9486,0.367003367003367,0.3611111111111111,0.33156498673740054,5,7,0.9832,0.8113,0.18016194331983806,0.148,0.20567375886524822,0.8408,0.8602,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Universal Basic Dorms.txt,"Poor people have too little money. So why don’t we just give them more money, instead of giving them many specific things? The main theory in the literature is paternalism:
The traditional justification for in-kind transfers has been “paternalism.” … If members of society care about the consumption patterns of the poorest rather than their utility, then the unconstrained choices of the poor may create negative externalities for those who care about them. … while income inequality per se may be acceptable, all individuals should receive adequate food, medical service, and housing. … Parents may not take full account of the utility of their children when making decisions, or they may neglect to factor in externalities. … attempt to redistribute from parents to children within the family. … a sense that the poor cannot be trusted with cash. … it is hard to escape the conclusion that paternalism remains a fundamental underlying rationale for in-kind transfers. (more)
You may not be surprised to hear I have an elaboration of this account based on signaling and status. Let’s start with this result:
[A] 2010 paper … makes a strong case that in fact the outcome of life satisfaction depends on the incomes of others only via income rank. (Two followup papers find the same result for outcomes of psychological distress and nine measures of health.) They looked at 87,000 Brits, and found that while income rank strongly predicted outcomes, neither individual (log) income nor an average (log) income of their reference group predicted outcomes, after controlling for rank (and also for age, gender, education, marital status, children, housing ownership, labor-force status, and disabilities). (more)
So if satisfaction and preference go simply as income rank, then there is simply no way to to use income redistribution to help with such things. Whatever you give to some comes at the expense of others, for no net gain. You can still want to help the poor, but that requires that your concern about their lives not be mediated directly by their satisfaction or preferences. That is, what you want regarding them can’t equal what they want or what makes them happy. For example, compared to the poor, you might put less weight on their desires to signal, and to rise in status via positional goods (like winning a sporting contest). Because you can see the negative externalities associated with such things. That is, you might put more weight than they do on the remainder of their preferences, which we might call their “direct welfare”. If there are diminishing returns to direct welfare, then you can want to reduce the overall variance of direct welfare, by giving more of it to the poor, at the expense of the non-poor. But you can reasonably fear that if you just give them cash they will spend too much of that on the kinds of non-direct welfare that have negative externalities.","So you can want to constrain their choices, to better ensure that it is direct welfare that you are giving them. The big problem here is: how to distinguish the goods, i.e., products and services, that put more weight on signaling and status, relative to those that put more weight on direct welfare. The usual political equilibrium is to give the poor the sorts of goods that people tend to praise and admire, at least for others. Like jobs, medicine, education, libraries, art, churches, and fresh vegetables. And to withhold from the poor goods that people tend to criticize and dislike, at least for others. Like parties, drugs, sex, fast food, social media, movies, and video games. But alas, typical admired goods don’t obviously have smaller positional components, nor do they obviously contribute less to signaling. For example, both education and medicine, widely given to the poor, have huge signaling and status components, plausibly even larger than for most goods. If we cannot in practice distinguish the goods that do more to promote direct welfare, we should give up on in-kind transfers and just give the poor cash. And then only to the extent that we think direct welfare has strongly diminishing returns in terms of cash. I have a (perhaps not original) idea. We have good reasons to think that in general most product and service variety emphasizes signaling and status, relative to standard goods that can achieve large scale economies. So if we can make especially cheap cars, homes, clothes, food, etc. via mass production with a small range of variety, then we should prefer to spend our budget on helping the poor via such standard goods. That is, assume that we the non-poor have a budget that we are willing to spend on helping the poor. We have two reasons to prefer to spend this budget on standard goods. First, standard goods can be provided much more cheaply, allowing us to give more to each person, or to help more people. Second, because these goods have a lower signaling and status components, the poor who consume them hurt the rest of us less via making us look worse by comparison, and rising in status relative to us. We should thus be wiling to increase the budget that we spend on the poor, in compensation. Of course the poor may resent this policy, even if it results in larger budgets. Exactly because we choose these standard goods to have lower signaling and positional components, the poor will know that others who see that they are using such standard goods designed for the poor may think less of them as a result. That may not be quite the same as a “stigma” assigned to such goods, but it may have a similar effect. Even so, this looks like an efficient arrangment. So how exactly can we give standard goods to the poor? There’s an obvious risk that the government, or a charity, managing such poverty assistance might overly micromanage","(more)
So, the idea is that we don’t want to give the poor cash because it would make them consume more of the things that make them and others unhappy. But we can give them things that help them with their direct welfare, but not the ones that would be used to signal or to compete with others. So the question is: how do we determine what the poor want, and what is the optimal level of direct welfare that they should have, and what is the optimal level of positional goods? But that is all very complicated.
But in the end, the conclusion is that giving the poor things that are not positional goods (i.e., not things that are used to signal or compete with others) is better than giving them cash, even if the poor themselves value positional goods more than direct welfare. So, for example, if the poor value positional goods more, but you think that they are actually not that important for their well-being, then you would want to give them things that are not positional goods. So the idea is that we have a social preference that is not aligned with the poor's own preferences, and that we want to help them even if they don't want us to. (more)
But wait, the problem with this is that if the poor are given things that are not positional, then they may not be able to spend their money on positional goods, and that could be a problem. For example, if they are given in-kind transfers, they can't spend their money on things that would signal their status. But if they are given cash, they can spend it on things that would signal their status. But maybe the poor would be better off if they had more money, even if they use it for positional goods. The problem is that we may think that positional goods are bad for their well-being. So we can have a conflict between what the poor want and what we think is better for them. But the problem is that we can’t know",483,500,352,0.2579,0.2816,0.9502,0.9322,0.8484,0.9771,-3.3418,0.517,0.4192,0.4555,0.0655,0.071,0.0169,0.0079,0.7271,0.7094,0.9653,0.9625,0.41532976827094475,0.4051724137931034,0.5376884422110553,5,4,0.9576,0.9874,0.15320910973084886,0.154,0.13352272727272727,0.8731,0.5859,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Women As Worriers Who Exclude.txt,"This is an excellent 2014 book on how men differ from women:
In Warriors and Worriers, psychologist Joyce Benenson presents a new theory of sex differences, based on thirty years of research with young children and primates around the world. … boys and men deter their enemies, while girls and women find assistants to aid them in coping with vulnerable children and elders. … Human males form cooperative groups that compete against out-groups, while human females exclude other females in their quest to find mates, female family members to invest in their children, and keep their own hearts ticking. In the process, Benenson turns upside down the familiar wisdom that women are more sociable than men and that men are more competitive than women. Especially interesting is her discussion of how central social exclusion is to female behavior:
How does a woman compete while minimizing the risk of retaliation? I suggest that women use a few simple strategies. Strategy 1 is that a woman does not ever let anyone else know that she is competing with them. … She preaches the mantra of equality for all, and sincerely believes it. …Unaware of her own competitive instincts, she tries to get as much as she can for herself, while insisting that everyone else share equally. If strategy 1 is not working out well enough, then a woman may switch to strategy 2, which requires employing social exclusion. She must ally with other females to run their target out of town. That way, they retain more resources, status, allies, babysitters, and high-quality mates for themselves. The virtue of social exclusion is that it allows overt competition but reduces the risk of retalitation because the target is outnumbered. Should strategy 2 fail, the final fallback is strategy 3, which is reserved for emergencies. It entails a direct hit on a competitor, a physical or verbal assault. If a woman must use strategy 3, she has failed. She is no longer nice; she is mean. … She will be abandoned by former allies. Not only that, but she risks retaliation from her target. …
Strategy 2 comes into play when one female stands out. She may stand out because she obviously tries to outdo everyone else. She may stand out because she is new, extremely talented, or simply has the resources or relationships that others want. She may even stand out simply because she is an easy target and has nothing going for her. She has no allies. It would cost little to be rid of her, leaving more for everyone else. In any of these circumstances, it might be worth using a more direct competitive strategy. However, any form of individual, direct competition leaves open the possibility of retaliation and potential harm. One way of minimizing this is for several girls or women to gang up on a single target. This way, there is little chance of any one of the group suffering harm. Social exclusion accomplishes just that.","… Barring imminent death of herself or her child, nothing strikes more fear into the heart of a girl or woman than the thought that she will be excluded. In one recent study, my students and I asked women and men simply to read about being socially excluded by a friend. Women’s heart rates increased much more than men’s heart rates did. In contrast, women’s and men’s heart rates increased equally when they imagined being physically assaulted by a friend. … Social exclusion is primarily a female strategy. … Girls practice it from early childhood. It has been used by females across diverse cultures in middle childhood and adolescence and adulthood … An experimenter brought two 6-year-olds, either girls or boys, to a room … One week later, the same two children returned to the room and … a third child of the same sex was brought to the room after the pair had been playing for a while. … pairs of girls were more likely than pairs of boys to exclude the newcomer. … Girls took more than three times as long as boys to speak to the newcomer. … In 4 of the 15 girls’ groups, the girls never spoke a single word to the newcomer. … In interviews conducted in Adelaide, Australia, middle-class girls in Catholic schools reported many instances of temporary and permanent exclusion of former friends, new girls, vulnerable girls with few friends or little self-confidence, or geeky girls. … At one … school, two or three cases occurred per year in which the exclusion was so severe that a girl had to transfer to another school. Unfortunately, nothing is worse than entering a new school. These transfer girls often found themselves excluded again. … Several studies show that [women] dislike moving more than men do. … We asked groups of five 10-year-olds from schools in Plymouth, England, if they would produce a short play. … Every group worked hard. No adults were present. … The seven boys’ plays consisted primarily of skits based either on a popular television show or on football (soccer) matches between two well-known teams. … All of the boys took part equally in these plays. No one was singled out. In contrast, six of the seven girls’ plays involved social exclusion of a target girl. … girls more frequently formed a coalition whose members synchronously directed behavior toward one lone girl. Second, the girls varied more in the amount of time each girl got on stage. The girl who was excluded got a lot less air time … We mentioned that if a participant played alone, then the two opponents would be able to get together to exclude them. Even though this did not affect the participant’s chances of winning, women immediately switched strategies. Instead of playing alone, they chose to ally with one player and exclude the other one. Men were completely unaffected. … When we asked young adults to describe any occasions in the past year when they","…
So, the social exclusion is not only a way of reducing the risk of retaliation, but also a way of maintaining a sense of fairness. The woman who excludes someone else is not being unfair. She is simply ensuring that her own resources, status, and alliances are not compromised. …
The question is: What is the evolutionary purpose of this behavior? It is to maintain the balance of the group. … It is a form of social balance that allows for competition, but not for violence. …
But wait, the author is not only talking about how women exclude others, but also how men are different. The book is about how men are more likely to form groups that compete against other groups, while women focus on their own group, excluding others. This is not the same as the traditional view of women as more sociable and men as more competitive. But it is not a new idea, it is a more detailed version of a theory that has been around for a few decades.
I think the book is very important for understanding human behavior. It is not just about how women and men differ, but about the evolutionary reasons behind these differences. It is also about how these differences affect our social interactions, relationships, and even our mental health. The book is written in a clear, accessible language that makes it easy to understand. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the topic of human behavior and evolution.
I found this review of the book on the internet. I want to make sure that the book is real and that the author is correct. So, I want to check whether the book ""Warriors and Worriers: The Evolutionary Psychology of Sex Differences"" by Joyce Benenson is a real book. Let me check.
I can check this by searching for the book on Amazon, Goodreads, or other book retailers. I can also check if the author is a known psychologist.

Robin Hanson,"Why Economics Is, And Should Be, Creepy.txt","Hostile questioners tried to trap Jesus into taking an explicit and dangerous stand on whether Jews should or should not pay taxes to the Roman authorities. … Jesus first called them hypocrites, and then asked one of them to produce a Roman coin that would be suitable for paying Caesar’s tax. One of them showed him a Roman coin, and he asked them whose head and inscription were on it. They answered, “Caesar’s,” and he responded: “Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s; and unto God the things that are God’s”. (more)
Long ago, Jesus avoided political entanglements by appealing to a key distinction long made between “official” worlds like work, commerce, war, governance, and law, and “personal” worlds like friends, lovers, parenting, hobbies, religion, conversation, and art. Economists have long been identified with that official world, of work and money and material things. But over the last century economists have increasingly moved outside that official world, looking at mating, conversation, and much more. This has often irritated academics who study personal worlds; they’ve seen economists as having “imperialist” ambitions to “conquer” other academic areas. Economists studying personal worlds have also bothered a public that hears of economic concepts applied to personal worlds, but using words originally associated with official worlds. For example, “marriage markets”, “dollar value of a life”, “price of fame,” “below optimal crime”, or my recent “sex redistribution”. This can seem to violate common norms separating official and personal worlds, which I’ll call “world norms”, such as that money should stay out of friendship, or governments stay out of conversation. And this can make economics seem “creepy.”
What is “creepy”? Imagine you are in a bar, late at night, in a not-so-safe neighborhood. You look a little different from the locals, you’ve heard of muggings nearby, you suspect muggers may follow non-locals out of the bar to mug them, and you see some people in the bar who rub you the wrong way. They are poor young males with a rough style, and you can’t be sure but you feel like they glance at you sometimes and their jocular laughing seems a bit fake. At this moment, you are likely to see them as “creepy”, i.e., as an ambiguous threat. You aren’t at all sure they are a threat, but threat is plausible and something about them doesn’t feel right. A nice recent psych article says “creepiness” is all about threat ambiguity:
The perception of creepiness is a response to the ambiguity of threat. Males are more physically threatening to people of both sexes than are females, and they were more likely to be perceived as creepy by males and females alike. The link made by females between sexual threat and creepiness is also consistent with the fact that females are simply at greater risk of sexual assault and have potentially greater costs associated with it than males.","We are placed on our guard by people who touch us or exhibit non-normative nonverbal behavior, or those who are drawn to occupations that reflect a fascination with death or unusual sexual behavior. People who have hobbies that involve collecting things that we are predisposed as a species to fear such as spiders and snakes or things that can only be acquired after something has died seem creepy to us as well. We are also wary of individuals who have a preoccupation with monitoring the activity of others. While they may not be overtly threatening, individuals who display unusual patterns of nonverbal behavior, odd emotional responses, or highly distinctive physical characteristics are outside of the norm, and by definition unpredictable. This may activate our “creepiness detector” and increase our vigilance as we try to discern if there is in fact something to fear or not from the person in question. Interestingly, our results indicate that we do not necessarily assume ill intentions from people who are creepy, although we may still worry that they are dangerous. Most of our subjects believed that creepy people cannot change, and only a small minority of our subjects (8.6%) believed that creepy people are aware that they are creepy. (more) When economists make a “model” to analyze any area of life, they describe the different kinds of actors involved, and the different kinds of situations in which such actors can be. Within each situation, and for each actor, economists define the different possible actions an actor can take, and in what order, and the preferences each actor might have over outcomes. They also define what each actor knows when about those actions, outcomes, and preferences. Finally, economists assume some commonly-known probability distribution over situations and outcomes set by “nature.” This all defines a “game” that these actors play. Then using one of many standard “game theories”, economists can identify possible “equilibria” of such a game. Such an equilibrium determines a probability distribution over the outcomes, and combined with actor preferences gives distributions over how much each actor likes their outcomes. So economists can look at inequality across actors in how much they like outcomes, as well as the risk each actor faces from a range of possible future outcomes. Of course all this theory depends on knowing actual facts about situations, actions, preferences, and information, and also on knowing the actual game theories that describe how real people act. And so to study any particular area of life one seeks to infer all these details from lab and field experiments, and formal field data, all augmented by (and sometimes dominated by) causal observations. Economists can also look at variations to a game, and say how actor satisfaction, inequality, etc. depends on those variations. If some social norm or organizational (e.g., government) policy might plausibly influence variation along a dimension, such analyses can form a basis for recommending the policy positions along that dimension that produce better outcomes overall. Economists have a standard “efficiency” metric","(http://www.pnas.org/content/106/13/5490.full)
So creepiness is a response to threat ambiguity. And in the case of economics, the creepiness comes from the application of official concepts to personal worlds, which can be threatening in the sense of violating norms. The official world (e.g., the world of economics) is seen as a world of money, materialism, and exploitation, and the personal world is seen as a world of emotional, moral, and spiritual concerns. When economics is applied to the personal world, it can seem to be a threat to the norms that separate these two worlds. So economics, in its application to personal domains, becomes “creepy.”
But here’s the thing: the official world is not just money and materialism. The official world includes things like law, politics, and government. The personal world is not just emotional or spiritual, but also includes things like friendship, conversation, and family. So when economists apply their tools to personal domains, they are not necessarily violating norms. The problem is that economists often use words from the official world (like “market,” “price,” “value,” “cost”) in personal domains. That can create a sense of creepiness. But if economists use words from the personal world to describe the official world, that might not be creepy. For example, if we talk about the “value of a life” in terms of how much it’s worth in a society, or the “cost of a government” in terms of how much it costs the taxpayer, then that is not creepy. But when economists use official words in personal domains, it can be creepy.
So, the key is that economics is not inherently creepy. It’s the misapplication of official words to personal domains that is creepy. The solution is to use words that are more appropriate for the personal domain. But this is difficult, because the personal domain is not a place where economists are",483,500,310,0.1069,0.3449,0.9577,0.9615,0.9738,0.6492,-0.5652,-7.5652,0.2759,0.3688,0.0158,0.0535,0.0,0.0078,0.2598,0.5818,0.9646,0.9263,0.37437603993344426,0.397212543554007,0.4162303664921466,7,6,0.9828,0.9762,0.14906832298136646,0.128,0.18387096774193548,0.9612,0.7157,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,School Is To Submit.txt,"Most animals in the world can’t be usefully domesticated. This isn’t because we can’t eat their meat, or feed them the food they need. It is because all animals naturally resist being dominated. Only rare social species can let a human sit in the role of dominant pack animal whom they will obey, and only if humans do it just right. Most nations today would be richer if they had long ago just submitted wholesale to a rich nation, allowing that rich nation to change their laws, customs, etc., and just do everything their way. But this idea greatly offends national and cultural pride. So nations stay poor. When firms and managers from rich places try to transplant rich practices to poor places, giving poor place workers exactly the same equipment, materials, procedures, etc., one of the main things that goes wrong is that poor place workers just refuse to do what they are told. They won’t show up for work reliably on time, have many problematic superstitions, hate direct orders, won’t accept tasks and roles that that deviate from their non-work relative status with co-workers, and won’t accept being told to do tasks differently than they had done them before, especially when new ways seem harder. Related complaints are often made about the poorest workers in rich societies; they just won’t consistently do what they are told. It seems pride is a big barrier to material wealth. The farming mode required humans to swallow many changes that didn’t feel nice or natural to foragers. While foragers are fiercely egalitarian, farmers are dominated by kings and generals, and have unequal property and classes. Farmers work more hours at less mentally challenging tasks, and get less variety via travel. Huge new cultural pressures, such as religions with moralizing gods, were needed to turn foragers into farmers. But at work farmers are mostly autonomous and treated as the equal of workers around them. They may resent having to work, but adults are mostly trusted to do their job as they choose, since job practices are standardized and don’t change much over time. In contrast, productive industrial era workers must accept more local domination and inequality than would most farmers. Industry workers have bosses more in their face giving them specific instructions, telling them what they did wrong, and ranking them explicitly relative to their previous performance and to other nearby workers. They face more ambiguity and uncertainty about what they are supposed to do and how. How did the industrial era get at least some workers to accept more domination, inequality, and ambiguity, and why hasn’t that worked equally well everywhere? A simple answer I want to explore in this post is: prestigious schools. While human foragers are especially averse to even a hint of domination, they are also especially eager to take “orders” via copying the practices of prestigious folks.","Humans have a uniquely powerful capacity for cultural evolution exactly because we are especially eager and able to copy what prestigious people do. So if humans hate industrial workplace practices when they see them as bosses dominating, but love to copy the practices of prestigious folks, an obvious solution is to habituate kids into modern workplace practices in contexts that look more like the latter than the former. In his upcoming book, The Case Against Education, my colleague Bryan Caplan argues that school today, especially at the upper levels, functions mostly to help students signal intelligence, conscientiousness, and conformity to modern workplace practices. He says we’d be better off if kids did this via early jobs, but sees us as having fallen into an unfortunate equilibrium wherein individuals who try that seem non-conformist. I agree with Bryan that, compared with the theory that older students mostly go to school to learn useful skills, signaling better explains the low usefulness of school subjects, low transfer to other tasks, low retention of what is taught, low interest in learning relative to credentials, big last-year-of-school gains, and student preferences for cancelled classes. My main problem with Caplan’s story so far (he still has time to change his book) is the fact that centuries ago most young people did signal their abilities via jobs, and the school signaling system has slowly displaced that job signaling system. Pressures to conform to existing practices can’t explain this displacement of a previous practice by a new practice. So why did signaling via school did win out over signaling via early jobs? Like early jobs, school can have people practice habits that will be useful in jobs, such as showing up on time, doing what you are told even when that is different from what you did before, figuring out ambiguous instructions, and accepting being frequently and publicly ranked relative to similar people. But while early jobs threaten to trip the triggers than make most animals run from domination, schools try to frame a similar habit practice in more acceptable terms, as more like copying prestigious people. Forager children aren’t told what to do; they just wander around and do what they like. But they get bored and want to be respected like adults, so eventually they follow some adults around and ask to be shown how to do things. In this process they sometimes have to take orders, but only until they are no longer novices. They don’t have a single random boss they don’t respect, but can instead be trained by many adults, can select them to be the most prestigious adults around, and can stop training with each when they like. Schools work best when they set up an apparently similar process wherein students practice modern workplaces habits. Start with prestigious teachers, like the researchers who also teach at leading universities. Have students take several classes at at a time, so they have no single “boss” who personally benefits from their following his or her","So, foragers can be dominated by a small group of leaders, but only if those leaders are considered prestigious. So the way to get people to accept domination is to give them a reason to look up to the leader, and to be willing to accept the leader's authority. In the case of the industrial era, this might be the school system, which is considered prestigious, and people are willing to accept the authority of teachers, and thus to follow the instructions of their teachers, even if those instructions are not in the best interest of the person. In the case of the modern global economy, the way to get people to accept domination is to make them look up to the global elite, to be part of a group that is considered prestigious. So, the idea is that if you can get people to look up to the global elite, then they will accept being dominated by the global elite, and thus you can have them follow their instructions. So, the problem with the idea of letting poor countries be dominated by rich countries is that poor countries don’t yet look up to the rich countries, and they don’t yet see them as prestigious. So, the solution is to make poor countries look up to rich countries, so that the poor countries will accept being dominated by them, and thus be able to grow rich. So, the way to do this is to make the rich countries look prestigious, and to help the poor countries get into the same status. This is the idea of the global elite. But what is the global elite? It is a group of people, in the world, who are considered prestigious. That group can be a set of people who are rich, or a set of people who are smart, or a set of people who are highly educated, or a set of people who are from a certain country. So, the global elite is a group of people who are considered prestigious, and their ideas and practices are seen as superior, and thus people are willing to accept",479,500,356,0.1328,0.1364,0.9825,0.9148,0.6547,0.7112,10.36,7.9754,0.3655,0.324,0.0353,0.0384,0.006,0.0035,0.378,0.4742,0.9772,0.9463,0.4064748201438849,0.4078014184397163,0.5062344139650873,6,4,0.9727,0.9537,0.12317327766179541,0.108,0.1151685393258427,0.9707,0.5125,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Lost Advanced Civilizations.txt,"Did life on Earth start on Earth, or did it start on Mars and move to Earth? If you frame such panspermia as an “extraordinary claim” for which you demand “extraordinary evidence”, you will of course conclude that this should be treated “skeptically” as unlikely and sloppy unscientific “speculation”. To be disdained and not treated as serious by respectable academics and science journalists. But that’s not really fair. You see the early Mars environment is, a priori, about as likely a place for life to start as the Earth environment. So if the rate at which life is transferred between the planets were high enough, then equal chances of life starting first in both places would result in equal chances for Earth life to have started in either place. We should take the expected time difference between life starting in the two places, and ask how high is the chance that life would move from one planet to the next during that period. The more often rocks are thrown from one place to the other, and the more easily life could survive for the travel period within those rocks, then the more likely it is that Earth life started on Mars. In addition, Mars, being further from the Sun, would have cooled first, and had a head start in its window for life. Making it more likely that life would start there and spread to Earth than vice versa. Of course life starting first on Mars would have implications for what we might see when we look at Mars. If we had expected Mars life to continue strong until today, then the fact that we see no life on Mars now would be a big strike against this hypothesis. But if we expected Mars life to have died out or at least gone dormant by now, then the issue is what we will see when we dig on Mars. With enough data on such digs, we may come to reject to Mars first hypothesis even given its initial plausibility. A similar analysis applies to panspermia from other stars. You might think it obvious that the rate at which life-filled rocks from a star make it to seed other stars is very low, but most stars are born in large groups close together in stellar nurseries. So if life arose early enough within our star’s nursery, there might have been high rates of moving that life between stars in that nursery. In which case the chance that Earth life came from another star could also be high, and the best place to look for life outside our star would be the other stars from our stellar nursery. Now consider the possibility of lost advanced civilizations. Not just civilizations at a similar level of development to those around them in space and time; that’s quite likely given that we keep finding new previously-unknown settlements and developed places.","No, the more interesting claims are about substantial (but not crazy extreme) decreases in the peak or median level of civilizations across wide areas. Such as what happened late in the late Mediterranean Bronze Age, or at the fall of the Roman Empire. Could there have been “higher” civilizations before the “first” ones that we now know about in each region, such as the Sumerians, Egyptians, and Chinese Shang dynasty? (I’m talking human civs, not others.) Yes, you might think of these as “extraordinary” claims for which we lack extraordinary evidence, and declare them unlikely and sloppy unscientific speculation, to be disdained by the respectable. But again, that’s not fair. A priori it is nearly as likely that overall advancement in a region would have taken a big (but not crazy huge) temporary dip, as that it would have had a recently-typical rise. No, that isn’t much of a reason for skepticism. Substantial, if hardly overwhelming, supporting evidence comes in the form of writings from the earliest authors we can find, who explicitly claim that they descended from more advanced prior civilizations, who fell due to big cataclysms. This story is actually quite common. Further supporting evidence exists when the earliest versions of the first civilizations we see had surprisingly advanced abilities for their time in key areas, abilities which then declined over time. That is what you’d expect to see after a prior peak. And that does seem to be what we see in Egypt and Peru, as far as I can tell, regarding stone masonry abilities. Of course that might also just reflect local fluctuations in particular abilities; the big question is how much correlation to expect to see across different kinds of civilization abilities. The most common contrary evidence offered is the absence of expected supporting evidence. For example: No matter how devastating an extraterrestrial impact might be, are we to believe that after centuries of flourishing every last tool, potsherd, article of clothing, and, presumably from an advanced civilization, writing, metallurgy and other technologies—not to mention trash—was erased? Inconceivable. (More) He claims that glacial runoff from the comet’s incineration of the ice sheets covering North America could have destroyed every trace of civilization, though how animal bones survived but not a single stone or metal tool, or a single indisputably human-carved block of stone is beyond me … Clovis people left behind tens of thousands of stone tools and fluted points, while Atlantis is represented by exactly nothing. Even if their bones turned to dust, where are their stones and their metals? Where is the pollen from their crops…? (More) Here the key question here is: what sort of historical evidence should you expect to have already seen, if it were really there? On the one hand, we clearly have seen enough to safely conclude that there aren’t large dinosaurs roaming the streets in our major city centers. On the other hand, we often hear reports of people uncovering old things that others had pretty confidently","But even more likely is the possibility that we are not the first intelligent species in the galaxy. And if we are, then we are not the first to have sent messages or used the stars as a means of communication. So, if the chance of life starting on a planet is high, and the chance of advanced civilizations developing on a planet is high, and the chance of them sending messages to other planets is also high, then the chance that we are not the first in the galaxy is high. Therefore, the chance that we are not the first in the galaxy is high. Given that, the chance that the first message we received was from an alien civilization is high. Therefore, the chance that we have received a message from aliens is high. So, if we find an alien message, it would be a strong confirmation that we are not the first in the galaxy. If we do not find an alien message, then we are still not sure. But the fact that we have not found one is not necessarily evidence against the possibility that we are not the first. In the same way, the fact that we have not found evidence of life on Mars is not necessarily evidence against the possibility that life started on Mars.

Robin Hanson,Intellectual Prestige Futures.txt,"As there’s been an uptick of interest in prediction markets lately, in the next few posts I will give updated versions of some of my favorite prediction market project proposals. I don’t own these ideas, and I’d be happy for anyone to pursue any of them, with or without my help. And as my first reason to consider prediction markets was to reform academia, let’s start with that. Back in 2014, I restated my prior proposals that research patrons subsidize markets, either on relatively specific results likely to be clearly resolved, such as the mass of the electron neutrino, or on simple abstract statements to be judged by a distant future consensus, conditional on such a consensus existing. Combinatorial markets connecting abstract questions to more specific ones could transfer their subsidizes to those the latter topics. However, I fear that this concept tries too hard to achieve what academics and their customers say they want, intellectual progress, relative to what they more really want, namely affiliation with credentialed impressiveness. This other priority better explains the usual behaviors of academics and their main customers, namely students, journalists, and patrons. (For example, it was a bad sign when few journals showed interest in using prediction market estimates of which of their submissions were likely to replicate.) So while I still think the above proposal could work, if patrons cared enough, let me now offer a design better oriented to what everyone cares more about. I’d say what academics and their customers want more is a way to say which academics are “good”. Today, we mostly use recent indicators of endorsement by other academics, such as publications, institutional affiliations, research funding, speaking invitations, etc. But we claim, usually sincerely, to be seeking indicators of long term useful intellectual impact. That is, we want to associate with the intellectuals about whom we have high and trustworthy shared estimates of the difference that their work will make in the long run toward valuable intellectual progress. A simple way to do this would be to create markets in assets on individuals, where each asset pays as a function of a retrospective evaluation of that individual, an evaluation made in the distant future via detailed historical analysis. By subsidizing market makers who trade in such assets, we could today have trustworthy estimates to use when deciding which individuals among us we should consider for institutional affiliations, funding, speaking invitations, etc. (It should be easy for trade on assets that merge many individuals with particular features, such as Ph.Ds from a particular school.)
Once we had a shared perception that these are in fact our best available estimates, academics would prefer them over less reliable estimates such as publications, funding, etc. As the value of an individual’s work is probably non-linear in their rank, it might make sense to have people trade assets which pay as a related non-linear function of their rank.","This could properly favor someone with a low median rank but high variance in that rank over someone else with a higher median but lower variance. Why wait to evaluate? Yes, distant future evaluators would know our world less well. But they would know much better which lines of thought ended up being fruitful in a long run, and they’d have more advanced tech to help them study intellectual connections and lineages. Furthermore, compound interest would give us access to a lot more of their time. For example, at the 7% post-inflation average return of the S&P500 1871-2021, one dollar becomes one million dollars in 204 years. (At least if the taxman stays aside.) Furthermore, such distant evaluations might only be done on a random fraction, say one percent, of individuals, with market estimates being conditional on such a future evaluation being made. And as it is likely cheaper to evaluate people who worked on related topics, it would make sense to randomly pick large sets of related individuals to evaluate together. Okay, but having ample resources to support evaluations by future historians isn’t enough; we also need to get clear on the evaluation criteria they are to apply. First, we might just ask them to sort a sample of intellectuals relative to each other, instead of trying to judge their overall quality on some absolute scale. Second, we might ask them to focus on an individual’s contributions to helping the world figure out what is true on important topics; being influential but pushing in the wrong directions might count against them. Third, to correct for problems caused by scholars who play organizational politics, I’d rather ask future historians to rate how influential an individual should have been, if others had been a bit more fair in choosing to whom to listen. The proposal I’ve sketched so far is relatively simple, but I fear it looks too stark; forcing academics to admit more than they’d like that the main thing they care about is their relative ranking. Thus we might prefer to pay a mild complexity cost to focus instead on having future historians rate particular works by intellectuals, such as their journal articles or books. We could ask future historians to rate such works in such a way that the total value of each intellectual was reasonably approximated by the sum of the values of each of their work’s. Under this system, intellectuals could more comfortably focus on arguing about the the total future impact of each work. Derivatives could be created to predict the total value of all the works by an individual, to use when choosing between individuals. But everyone could claim that is just a side issue, not their main focus. To pursue this project concept, a good first step would be to fund teams of historians to try to rank the works of intellectuals from several centuries ago. Compare the results of different historian teams assigned to the same task, and have teams seek evaluation","For example, if the market is a function of the number of people who have been ranked above them, then the asset pays a function of the number of people above them, such as their rank. But if you have a market on the rank of the individual, then the value of the asset is the rank, and the value of the rank is the amount of money that the individual can get from others, which is the number of people who have been ranked above them. So it’s a bit of a circularity, but it's a good one. However, the key is that the value of the asset is the amount of money that the individual can get from others, which is the number of people who have been ranked above them. Therefore, the value of the asset is the amount of money that the individual can get from others, which is the amount of money that the individual can get from others. This seems like a very clever idea, but it's a bit of a circularity. Maybe I need to rephrase it to be clearer. 

Let me think. The idea is to create a prediction market where each asset represents the future rank of an academic. The value of the asset is determined by the future rank, which is the number of people who are ranked above the individual. The more people are ranked above an individual, the lower the value of the asset. So, if an academic is ranked first, their asset has the highest value, and if they are ranked last, the asset has the lowest value. 

But wait, that seems a bit counterintuitive. If the asset is based on the rank, then the value of the asset would be the rank, which is a number that decreases as the individual is ranked higher. So, the asset's value would be the number of people ranked above them. If the individual is ranked first, the asset would have a value of zero, since no one is ranked above them. If they are ranked second, the",485,500,348,0.2031,0.0994,0.9754,0.807,0.9341,0.7964,-1.7143,-5.2941,0.3846,0.3002,0.0374,0.0413,0.0042,0.0047,0.4285,0.3195,0.9765,0.9094,0.40535714285714286,0.4045936395759717,0.5355329949238579,6,4,0.972,0.9856,0.13195876288659794,0.102,0.12643678160919541,0.9485,0.4723,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Life in 1KD.txt,"Years ago I read Flatland and Planiverse, stories set in a two-dimensional universe. To me these are the epitome of “hard science fiction”, wherein one makes one (or a few) key contrary assumptions, and then works out their physical and social consequences. I’ve tried to do similarly in my work on the Age of Em and the Hardscrapple Frontier. Decades ago I thought: why not flip the dimension axis, and consider life in a thousand spatial dimensions? I wrote up some notes then, and last Thursday I was reminded of Flatland, which inspired me to reconsider the issue. Though I couldn’t find much prior work on what life is like in this universe, I feel like I’ve been able to quickly guess many plausible implications in just a few days. But rather than work on this in secret for more months or years, perhaps with a few collaborators, I’d rather show everyone what I have now, in the hope of inspiring others to contribute. This seems the sort of project on which we can more easily work together, as we less need to judge the individual quality of contributors; we can instead just ask each to “prove” their claims via citations, sims, or math. Here is what I have so far. I focus on life made out of atoms, but now in a not-curved unlimited space of dimension D=1024 (=2^10), plus one time dimension. I assume that some combination of a big bang and hot stars once created hot dense plasmas with equal numbers of electrons and protons, and with protons clumped into nuclei of varying sizes. As the universe or star regions expanded and cooled, photons bound nuclei and electrons into atoms, and then atoms into molecules, after which those clumped into liquids or solids. Molecules and compounds first accreted atoms, then merged with each other, and finally perhaps added internal bonds. A cubic array of atoms of length L with as many surface as interior atoms satisfies (L/(L-2))^D = 2, which for D = 1024 gives L = 2956. Such a cube has (2956)^1024 atoms in total. As I hereby define 2^(2^10) to be “crazy huge” and 2^(-2^10) to be “crazy tiny”, this is a more than crazy huge array. (“Crazy huge” is ~100K times a “centillion”. “Astronomical” numbers are tiny by comparison to these.)
We thus conclude that solids or liquids substantially smaller than crazy huge have almost no interiors; they are almost all surface. If they are coupled strongly enough to a surrounding volume of uniform temperature or pressure, then they also have uniform parameters like that. Thus not-crazy-huge objects can’t have separated pipes or cavities. Stars with differing internal temperatures must also be extra crazy huge. The volume V(r,D) of a sphere of radius r in D dimensions is V = r^D pi^(D/2) / (D/2)!. For dimensions D = (1,2,3,8,24), the densest packing of spheres of unit radius is known to be respectively (0.5,0.28,0.18,0.063,1) spheres per unit volume.","The largest D for which this value is known is 24, where the sphere volume fraction (i.e., fraction of volume occupied by spheres) is V(1,24) ~= 1/518. If we assume that for D=1024 the densest packing is also no more than one unit sphere per unit volume, then the sphere volume fraction there is no more than V(1,1024) = 10^-912. So even when atoms are packed as closely as possible, they fill only a crazy tiny fraction of the volume. If the mean-free path in a gas of atoms of radius r is the gas volume per atom divided by atom collision cross-section V(2r,D-1), and if the maximum packing density for D=1024 is one atom of unit radius per unit volume, then the mean free path is 10^602.94. It seems that high dimensional gases have basically no internal interactions. I worry that this means that the big bang doesn’t actually cause nuclei, atoms, and molecules to form. But I’ll assume they do form as otherwise we have no story to tell. Higher dimensions allow far more direction and polarization degrees of freedom for photons. The generalized Stefan-Boltzmann law, which says the power is radiated by a black body at temperature T, has product terms T^(D+1), (2pi^0.5)^(D-1), and Gamma(D/2), all of which make atoms couple much more strongly to photons. Thus it seems high D thermal coupling is mainly via photons and phonons, not via gas. Bonds between atoms result from different ways to cram electrons closer to atomic nuclei. In our world, ionic bonds come from moving electrons from higher energy orbital shells at one atom into lower energy shells at other atoms. This can be worth the cost of giving each atom a net charge, which then pulls the atoms together. Covalent bonds are instead due to electrons finding configurations in the space between two atoms that allow them to simultaneously sit in low shells of both atoms. Metallic bonds are covalent bonds spread across a large regular array of atoms. Atoms seem to be possible in higher dimensions. Electrons can have more degrees of spin, and there are far more orbitals all at the lowest energy level around nuclei. Thus nuclei would need to have very large numbers of protons to fill up all the lowest energy levels. I assume that nuclei are smaller than this limit. Thus different types of atoms become much more similar to each other than they are in our D=3 universe. There isn’t a higher shell one can empty out to make an ionic bond, and all of the covalent bonds have the same simple spatial form. The number of covalent bonds possible per atom should be < ~3*D, and B < ~D-10 creates a huge space of possible relative rotations of bonds. Also, in high dimensions the angles between random vectors are nearly right angles. Furthermore, irregularly-shaped mostly-surface materials don’t seem to have much scope for metallic bonds. Thus in high dimensions most atom bonding comes from nearly right angle covalent bonds.","For D=1024, the density is (by analogy with D=8,24) probably still 0.063 or so. Then the number of atoms in a sphere of radius r is ~ (0.063) r^D * (volume of each atom). For D=1024, and r=1, that’s about 0.063 times the volume of one atom, so about 0.063 atoms. That seems absurd. So in 1024 dimensions, even a small sphere has only a few atoms. So even a small object is made up of only a few atoms. Thus the idea of a “crazy huge” object is not that it is a very large object, but that it is a large number of atoms. That is, it’s a large number of atoms in a small volume, so that it is not “crazy huge” in terms of its radius, but rather in terms of its total number of atoms. So, for example, a “crazy huge” star is one with 2^2^10 atoms, which is 2^1024 atoms. So, in terms of radius, that would be r = (N / 0.063)^{1/D} * (volume of each atom)^{-1/D}. But if N is 2^1024, and D=1024, then r is about (2^1024 / 0.063)^{1/1024} = 2^{(1024/1024)} * (1/0.063)^{1/1024} = 2 * (1/0.063)^{1/1024} ≈ 2 * 1.002 ≈ 2",493,500,202,0.2813,0.2969,0.9852,0.8941,0.9766,0.6038,-0.4384,-7.4143,0.3618,0.3174,0.0403,0.0422,0.0061,0.0053,0.299,0.2106,0.9591,0.8856,0.37748344370860926,0.3648881239242685,0.3548387096774194,7,5,0.9684,0.9236,0.19878296146044624,0.156,0.3316831683168317,0.9463,0.5584,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Ancient Fertility Quotes.txt,"This graph of European urban population over history shows some dramatic declines, suggesting that there may have been historical analogue to our upcoming world population decline. And there have long been rumors that at least elites often had low fertility. Searching for quotes, I’ve found these:
Classical literary sources, tombstone inscriptions and skeletal remains have been used by classicists to show that there was probably a decline in the population of the Roman Empire caused by the deliberate control of family numbers through contraception, infanticide, and child exposure.…
If the modern fertility transition … is not unique, then its most likely predecessors were probably found in the classical period, especially in Ancient Rome, or in Soong China or Tokugawa Japan. …
Where the literary evidence is strongest is that there was a significant restriction of legitimate fertility in upper-class society [in ancient Rome]. That there was such a phenomenon is given greater strength by agreement, both ancient and modern, on why it should have taken place, namely fear of dividing the family patrimony among the heirs, so inevitably demoting them and their children down the social and economic ladders. This would have meant one section of the society exhibiting long-term but probably stable lower fertility. This may not have been a rare phenomenon in history. It may well have been the situation among the Genevese bourgeoisie in the eighteenth century. It may have been the situation in France that resulted from the equal inheritance promoted by the revolutionary army and the statutes of the Code Napoleón, a phenomenon possibly misinterpreted because the French fertility decline was caught up by the emerging global fertility transition induced by the Industrial Revolution.

Europeans report[ing] on Asian infanticide … were surprised that infanticide occurred not only within marriage but among the rich as well as the poor. … Infanticide, even when not proscribed, usually had an element of secrecy, … Bangladesh … mortality rates showed a preference for a family consisting of two sons and one daughter. … East India Company officials noted with surprise that infanticide in India was practised not by the poor but by the rich …
Family pride was, and is, strongly associated with the ability to pay cripplingly high dowries. … All this is propelled by … aim of subcastes to be seen to behave as higher subcastes, … In the top rungs of these castes the daughters could not marry higher and so the only way to avoid the degrading shame of having a postpubertal unmarried daughter in the family was to kill her at birth. The East India Company’s reports recorded such subclans as claiming that no daughter had been raised for generations. …
Tokugawa [Japan] near-stationary population was achieved with lower marital fertility but higher marriage levels than in England at the same time. Lower marital fertility was partly attained by infanticide, although this was probably practised mostly in families with above-average fertility or below-average child mortality.","It probably ensured a lower level of difficulty over land inheritance and fewer other siblings seeking work off the family farm and outside agriculture. … From his field work on the lower Yangtze in 1936, spoke of infanticide being common at that time especially when small landholders were faced with the problem of land division. … The evidence is clear that the main fear in having too many sons was the division of the land in a male partible inheritance system to the point where the sons cannot grow enough food for their families’ needs. … Sons beyond the second were so disadvantageous that they were often given away; … The expanding West with its denial of the right to kill a child was deeply shocked on encountering large-scale [Asian] infanticide.… decision to kill is usually made by the father, … women are more likely to reveal what happens, partly because many are aggrieved. The act is nearly always carried out by women. … There is usually a desire to improve one’s situation or that of the family or to ensure that one’s descendants are not poorer. Female infanticide was greatest among the richest in eighteenth-century and nineteenth-century India. … Situation was identical among the middle class in ancient Rome and probably among the late eighteenth-century and nineteenth- century French peasantry. The lowest subcastes in India’s hypergamous castes could not afford dowry for the marriages of more than one daughter. (more) Added 29Mar2025: Aristotle Politics II.9 : The mention of avarice naturally suggests a criticism on the inequality of proprty. While some of the Spartan citizens have quite small properties, others have very large ones: hence the land has passed into the hands of a few. And this is due also to faulty laws; for, although the legislator rightly holds up to shame the sale or purchase of an inheritance, he allows anybody who likes to give or bequeath it. Yet both practices lead to the same result. And nearly two-fifths of the whole country are held by women; this is owing to the number of heiresses and to the large dowries which are customary. It would surely have been better to have given no dowries at all, or, if any, but small or moderate ones. As the law now stands, a man may bestow his heiress on any one whom he pleases, and, if he die intestate, the privilege of giving her away descends to his heir. Hence, although the country is able to maintain 1500 cavalry and 30,000 hoplites, the whole number of Spartan citizens fell below 1000. The result proves the faulty nature of their laws respecting property; for the city sank under a single defeat; the want of men was their ruin. There is a tradition that, in the days of their ancient kings, they were in the habit of giving the rights of citizenship to strangers, and therefore, in spite of their long wars, no lack of population was experienced by them; indeed, at one","…
The historical record, including the evidence from skeletons, shows that in the Roman Empire, the fertility of the upper classes was significantly lower than that of the lower classes. …
So the question is, is this a historical pattern, and if so, why? And how does it relate to the current situation in the West?
It seems that there have been many instances of historical population decline, not just in Europe, but also in other parts of the world, where the upper classes deliberately limited their family size, while the lower classes had higher fertility. This is not just a matter of the upper classes being less fertile, but of deliberate population control. In the Roman Empire, the upper classes were particularly involved in this. The same is true in other societies, such as the Tokugawa period in Japan and in certain parts of China. The phenomenon of deliberate family size control by the upper classes has been documented in many historical periods and places. It seems that this is a recurring pattern, possibly related to social, economic, and cultural factors.
So the question is, is this a historical pattern, and if so, why? And how does it relate to the current situation in the West?
So, I have to say that I have no idea, but I do know that the population of the West is declining, and that there is a pattern in history that suggests that perhaps this is not unique. The question is, why? And how does this relate to the current situation? The answer may lie in the fact that the West is facing a demographic crisis that is not unique to it, but is part of a larger pattern that has occurred in other parts of the world in the past. The question is, why is this happening now? What is different now that may be causing this decline? Is it due to changes in social values, economic factors, or other cultural shifts that have led to a change in family size preferences? Or is it simply a continuation of a long-standing pattern",492,500,350,0.1709,0.1631,0.9779,0.9336,0.8327,0.6399,-4.8011,-10.3375,0.3531,0.3627,0.0439,0.0536,0.0018,0.0065,0.5409,0.7737,0.9772,0.9733,0.4059040590405904,0.4283154121863799,0.5113924050632911,7,6,0.9732,0.8673,0.10365853658536585,0.122,0.13142857142857142,0.962,0.6615,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Frank’s Book Of Little Aliens.txt,"In his new book Little Book of Aliens, astrophysicist Adam Frank says that we now know almost nothing about aliens, but we will soon learn much more:
Fermi saw that if technologically advanced, star-faring civilizations really were common, they should already be everywhere, including Earth. … Relative to the age of the galaxy, any spacefaring species should be able to reach anywhere in the galaxy in the cosmic blink of an eye, yet we have not seen any definitive sign of them here on Earth. If technologically advanced exo-civilizations are common, then we should already have direct evidence of their existence. … For [Hart], Fermi’s paradox meant that we are the only intelligent life in the entire galaxy, end of story …
[But] there is a whole cottage industry of scientific papers that try to explain away Fermi’s paradox. For example, there’s the zoo hypothesis, which says the galaxy might be full of aliens but they’re purposely leaving Earth alone and watching us from afar. … [Or if] settled planets eventually went dark [then] … those holes might not get filled in for a long time. …
[Thus] the Fermi paradox does not tell us that the universe is silent when it comes to alien life. It speaks only to the question of why the aliens aren’t here, on Earth, right now. It doesn’t say anything about our searches for signals from alien civilizations on distant planets. … [Regarding] evidence of alien life on distant planets, the answer is simple. There is no Fermi paradox of that kind. We just haven’t really looked yet. Until now. …
Over the next ten, twenty, or thirty years, we’re going to be spooling in data from the stars that could finally answer our alien question. I can’t tell you what that answer will be, but I can tell you what we’re going to be looking for. I can tell you that because it is exactly what I, my colleagues, and the entire research community that we are just one small part of are working feverishly on. …
Nothing makes an astronomer’s heart beat faster than the discovery of an Earth-like world in the habitable zone. …No matter how far that planet is away from us, biosignatures will be proof that the planet has a biosphere, proof that it is a living alien world. … looking for pollution in the atmospheres of distant worlds may be the fastest way to find a distant civilization. … JWST for just a few weeks was enough to detect CFCs in our simulated inhabited alien planet. … The signature of these artificial lights will be encoded in the light from any alien planet with a civilization that uses them. … solar panels on planetary scales create clearly detectable technosignatures. Thus: we see no aliens here now, but we have boring ways to explain that, and the main other way to see aliens is to see when they slightly change the light from a star.","We’ve hardly done any of that so far, but will soon do lots more, and so will soon know much more about aliens. This argument, however, assumes little aliens who are much like us: short-lived communities near the surface of some planet. But what if there could be what I’ve called loud aliens, vast alien civilizations that have expanded for millions or billions of years drastically remaking galaxies or huge groups of galaxies to their tastes? On these we have strong data: we do not see any within a very large distance. We also have the strong data of our current date, which is very early compared to when we should expect if no other loud aliens will ever appear in our universe. Add in strong data of the durations til life first appeared on Earth and from now til simple life dies on Earth, and you get the grabby aliens model, with three parameters each fit to data, describing the stochastic distribution of loud aliens in space and time. Thus it seems we do know quite a lot about at least one kind of alien. For example, loud aliens appear roughly once per million galaxies and if we become loud we’ll meet the nearest other loud in roughly a billion years. Furthermore, any reasonable constraint on the ratio of quiet to loud aliens suggests that the chances of finding techno-signatures of quiet aliens at near our level will be very low. We won’t be finding those in the next few decades. Bio-signatures of primitive life, on the other hand, could be much more common. While Frank does at times try to imagine louder aliens, he seems continually drawn to focusing on aliens like us. For example, he can’t see how multi-star civs could integrate, due to human-like lifetimes: When it takes two hundred years to send a diplomat between two planets and no one lives more than a hundred years, you have a problem. If no one can travel faster than light, maybe it’s every solar system for itself. In that case, you never get galactic empires, just individual planetary cultures. These cultures might send settlement missions out to cross the stars once in a while, but given the distances and travel times, even if those settlements succeed, they’d quickly diverge culturally from the home world. If this is what happens, then aliens visiting Earth are not representatives from some Zorgovian Galactic Federation with vast experience of many worlds and many cultures. Instead, they’d be one-offs, and we might be their first visit anywhere. Frank tries to imagine aliens replacing biology with stuff more artificial, but has big doubts: What if most aliens aren’t gooey? That is, what if intelligent life’s biological phase is relatively short? … Even if some species decide not to download, you could argue that evolution would eventually weed them out on galactic or cosmic scales. The downloaded, machine-melded versions of life would be far smarter and stronger than their goo-bound cousins. … [But] There","…
I don't know if that's the way it is, but it's the way I see it. I think the main thing that we need to do is look for these biosignatures and technosignatures, and we should be able to find them. …
The key to solving Fermi’s paradox is to realize that we are not looking in the right place. We are looking in the wrong way. … We are looking for alien life that is here now, but the problem is that the answer to the paradox is not in the presence of alien life on Earth, but in the absence of alien life on Earth. …
So, I think we have to look for alien life in the wrong place. The problem is that we’re looking for alien life in the wrong way. So, the answer to Fermi’s paradox is not that there are no aliens, but that we are not looking in the right way. …
So the solution to the Fermi paradox is that we just haven’t looked in the right way. We need to look for the right things. …
The way that I see it, we have two different ways to find alien life.

Robin Hanson,Opacity Blocks Agreement.txt,"Years ago, I spent a big chunk of my intellectual career studying the rationality of disagreement, mostly via math modeling, but also some lab experiments. My main conclusion was that, for the purpose of accurate beliefs, it seems both desirable and feasible for people to not knowingly disagree (on facts). That is, people should not be able to estimate the sign of how someone else’s future opinion will differ from their own current opinion. I concluded that humans actually disagree more for signaling reasons. For example, being visibly persuaded by someone is widely seen as bowing to their higher status. This was one of the results that moved me to think more generally about hidden motives, such as we describe in our book The Elephant in the Brain: Hidden Motives in Everyday Life. But I think about the subject often, and I have to admit now that lately a different explanatory factor has stood out: just how hard it is to get into someone else’s head. Let me explain. Imagine that you face a big important decision that depends mainly in a single estimate, call it X. In this case, it makes a lot of sense to put substantial weight on estimates of X that you get from many different sources that you respect. You would of course discuss the topic as best you could before your decision deadline, but if X estimates continued to vary at deadline, in your decision you wouldn’t want to give too much extra weight to your own estimates, just because they were yours. You might know that you can make mistakes as easily as others. However most of the estimates X that we discuss in our conversations are far more removed from important concrete decisions. We care about them more because of the further conclusions that we might draw from them, and from the checks and signals they offer to help us rate and improve our thinkings systems. In which case, someone else’s opinion on X is mostly useful to your thoughts in giving you hints about what to consider, and in helping you to score and refine your thinking systems. The question is: how exactly can we make use of others opinions? Notice: it is actually hard to ever make use of anyone else’s thinking on anything. As a professor I can tell you that the most painful part of my job is reading student essays. Even though students are trying hard to make themselves understood by a person who they’ve been listening carefully to for an entire semester, and on a topic chosen to make this communication easier, even so it is usually quite a struggle to dimly understand the median student essay. Out on social media, such as on Twitter or in blog comment sections, a large fraction of posts are largely incomprehensible, and so badly so that there’s little point in trying to ask for clarification. This holds even for those written by college graduates.","Academics form disciplines and schools of thought, with standard terms, methods, and training, primarily to make it much easier for them to understand each other. Most of us have a decent chance of understanding our closest associates, but because we’ve known them for a long time, have much shared background, and usually stick to pretty simple topics. The ability to have fluid deep widely-varying conversations with associates is a rare treasured ability. The main criteria by which public intellectuals are selected, by far, is their ability to create an inviting mental space for readers. When writing works well, readers enter a mind that seems simple, inviting, and easy to relate to. Each sentence invites few possible interpretations, and the structure of arguments are made hard to miss. Achieving all this is hard work, and even the authors who can do so in their essays achieve far less in their informal conversations. So if we turn our attention now back to situations where other random people have a differing opinion to us regarding some random estimate X, we can see how hard it can be to make practical use of that. Sure, if we are about to take an action that directly depends on X, we can include their estimate in our weighted average of known estimates. But if not, then we face the challenge of what exactly to do. Our minds are complex systems that automatically give us output estimates X on a great many topics. They are all set up to automatically change all our estimates in response to a standard set of inputs such as new sense perceptions and new abstract theories. And they can give us estimates on most any questions we ask, and even give counterfactual answers about what we’d think if we accepted hypothesized perceptions or theories. Our minds do most of this quickly, smoothly, and out of our view. But, alas, our minds don’t seem to be set up to easily take others’ estimates on various random X as standard input. When others can show us their reasoning in enough local detail, we can often assimilate that reasoning into our thoughts, and thus their conclusions as well. When it works, this is the magic of conversation. But when we just see estimates without supporting inputs, we struggle to guess what inputs might have let them to these conclusions. Sometimes we can make good guesses, but quite often we cannot. So this is a plausible explanation for much human disagreement: while we can just simply put weight on others’ opinions re our decisions that are close enough to those opinions, we just don’t know how to update our mental systems to take their opaque opinions into account more generally. Our minds aren’t set up to take those as standard inputs. It is just too hard to search in the space of all possible ways their minds could have come to such conclusions. While we can and do take their opinions as hints re what arguments","So, even if we had a huge number of people giving us their estimates of X, we would not necessarily be able to make use of their estimates. If we can’t make use of others’ estimates of X, then why do we even care about them? The answer is that we are motivated by the desire to be right. So, when we hear someone else’s estimate of X, we are trying to see if it is more or less accurate than our own. So, in that case, if someone else’s estimate of X is more accurate, we are likely to adopt it. But if it is less accurate, we are likely to reject it. If it is about the same, we are likely to be indifferent. This is a very simple model, but I think it's accurate. The question is, then, what is the best way to get others to give us estimates of X that are more accurate than our own? Let me explain. If we are trying to find out what the correct value of X is, then we should be trying to get others to give us estimates of X that are more accurate than our own. If we are trying to find out what the correct value of X is, then we should be trying to get others to give us estimates of X that are more accurate than our own. But we have to be careful not to get others to give us estimates that are not more accurate. For example, if we are trying to find out what the correct value of X is, we might be tempted to ask a person with a lot of experience in the area. But that person might not be more accurate than our own estimate. In fact, in some cases, they might be less accurate. But even if they are more accurate, we might not be able to trust them. For example, if they are not independent of us, then they might not be more accurate. If we ask them, they might give us an estimate that is more accurate,",495,500,353,0.1934,0.271,0.9302,0.9307,0.9203,0.786,-1.9048,-5.1153,0.3738,0.414,0.0266,0.0699,0.0011,0.0138,0.5328,0.555,0.9688,0.9584,0.45601436265709155,0.45663716814159294,0.5483870967741935,5,5,0.9887,0.9782,0.09898989898989899,0.106,0.12181303116147309,0.9537,0.5502,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Would UFO Aliens Be Our Gods_.txt,"In ancient societies, leaders and elites gained legitimacy in the minds of the masses via impressive displays of clothes, music, furniture, food, buildings, parades, etc., which made more plausible their claims to actually be a higher class of creatures. Religions also gained legitimacy by claiming to represent even higher classes of creatures, i.e., gods, with which they also associated impressive luxury displays. The masses worshipped and obeyed these leaders and gods, and deferred to their judgment. One of the main reasons that we less worship and defer to such leaders and gods today is that we know more about them; we see leaders as less clearly superior, and gods as less clearly existing. But we are still the same sort of humans as the ancients, and so are capable of their actions, should we share their beliefs. Which brings us to an interesting hypothetical that I will now consider: What if the world soon comes to a general consensus that some UFOs actually are aliens? And what if our direct physical relation to these aliens doesn’t change much? That is, they still don’t talk to us, we only see them rarely, and we don’t find their “bases”, their origins, or figure out any of their tech. And what if this situation persists for another century, or for many centuries? In this postulated scenario, I think the main way that our world changes is this: in our minds, these UFO aliens take over the top of our status hierarchy; we see them as the top dog in our “pack”. And as status is a big deal to we social animals, this ends up being a big deal. The first obvious implication is that acting or looking alien-like would start to become higher status. Hovering, fast movement and acceleration, bright fuzzy lights, making no sounds, geometric shapes, and smooth shiny surfaces without protuberances. Because that’s just how status works; if aliens are high status, we want to look like them. Some would fall in status as a result of aliens being top status. The highest would fall, as would those who seemed to have opposed them, such as governments who lied about them and elite academics who dismissed them. We’d also see our familiar human elites and leaders as less in charge of our long term future. We’d guess that these aliens have some agendas, and so even if they haven’t actually done much yet, they may well intervene in some scenarios. Maybe we’d worry less about killing ourselves, if we think they’d stop that. And if aliens don’t seem worried that our AI experiments might create super-intelligences that suddenly explode to remake the universe, maybe we would worry less about that too. We would gossip a lot trying to guess alien priorities, priorities we’d be reluctant to visibly resist. We’d more want to adopt their priorities as our priorities, because, again, that is just how status works.","Just as people in firms gossip a lot about CEO priorities, and as courtiers of a king gossip a lot about king priorities. They gossip, and also try to pretend that the CEO/king priorities always were their own deepest priorities. People do seem to believe that they can guess UFO alien motives. In a recent poll, 65.2% of respondents guessed that these aliens main motive for visiting Earth is to “study us as independent example of life evolution.” Which is a pretty high status motive, you have to admit. No doubt the people who push each priority X would try to also push the view that aliens also prefer X. But we also have some more direct evidence on alien priorities. First, aliens must be very old and stable, so they less want or experience innovation and change compared to us. Second, they aren’t remaking the universe much around here, or anywhere we can see, yet such remaking would have happened naturally unless they had coordinated strongly to prevent it. Thus they must have a strong “world” government which enforces a policy of preventing mass colonization and remaking of the universe. They haven’t killed us yet, and they also let us see them, so they can’t feel very threatened by us at our current level. Also, they refuse to talk to us, so they don’t respect us that much, and aren’t that interested in running the details of our world or our lives, or in converting us to their beliefs. In a great many ways, we are just “beneath” them. Now when humans treat us like this, we are often offended, and expect observers to support our outrage. For example, 81% of respondents said that a small nation should see it an insult if the US refused to respond in any way to their request for a meeting. But only 36.6% of respondents said we should feel insulted if UFO aliens keep refusing to talk to us for another century. (And 52.3% said it would be an insult for a human to treat you like aliens are treating us now, in refusing to talk.) This all suggests to me that we treat UFO aliens as very high status. You are far more likely to be offended if your sister refused to talk to you, relative to Bill Gates refusing to talk, as you accept that Gates is much higher status than you or your sister. Similarly, even though UFO aliens have come to visit our home, and are showing off their vast abilities, which they must know makes us nervous, most still don’t think we should be offended by their refusing to talk to us. Perhaps because they are as gods to us? These inferred alien priorities have implications for our behavior. As the aliens have a world government, we’d be more inclined to give substantial powers to a world organization through which we study and deal with them. We’d also be more inclined to limit our physical and tech","The status hierarchy is a big deal. But the question is, what if aliens are not the top of the hierarchy? What if we are? What if we are the aliens, and they are the humans? What if the UFOs are not aliens, but us? Then we have a problem. The problem is that the status hierarchy is not as straightforward as we think. The status hierarchy is not a one-way thing. It is not only that aliens are higher; we can also be higher. And in that case, the status of the aliens depends on us. If we are higher, they are lower. If we are lower, they are higher. But if the status hierarchy is not one-way, then how do we know which one is the top? The problem is that it's a loop. If we are aliens, and they are humans, then we can be higher. If we are humans, and they are aliens, then we can be higher. And so, in this loop, there is no clear top. This is a problem, because then the status hierarchy is not a clear hierarchy. It is a loop. And this loop is what makes the status hierarchy not a clear hierarchy. But what if the UFOs are not aliens, but us? Then the problem is that we have to be careful about how we act, because if we act like aliens, we might be seen as lower status, and if we act like humans, we might be seen as higher. So the question becomes: what is the right way to act, given that we are not sure whether we are the higher or the lower in the hierarchy? That is, we are not sure whether we are the aliens or the humans. And that is the real problem. This is a problem that we need to solve, because if we don’t, then we might act in a way that is not in our best interest.

Robin Hanson,Why Not Wait On AI Risk_.txt,"Years ago when the AI risk conversation was just starting, I was a relative skeptic, but I was part of the conversation. Since then, the conversation has become much larger, but I seem no longer part of it; it seems years since others in this convo engaged me on it. Clearly most who write on this do not sit close to my views, though I may sit closer to most who’ve considered getting into this topic, but instead found better things to do. (Far more resources are available to support advocates than skeptics.) So yes, I may be missing something that they all get. Furthermore, I’ve admittedly only read a small fraction of the huge amount since written in this area. Even so, I feel I should periodically try again to explain my reasoning, and ask others to please help show me what I’m missing. The future AI scenario that treats “AI” most like prior wide tech categories (e.g., “energy” or “transport”) goes as follows. AI systems are available from many competing suppliers at similar prices, and their similar abilities increase gradually over time. Abilities don’t increase faster than customers can usefully apply them. Problems are mostly dealt with as they appear, instead of anticipated far in advance. Such systems slowly displace humans on specific tasks, and are on average roughly as task specialized as humans are now. AI firms distinguish themselves via the different tasks their systems do. The places and groups who adopt such systems first are those flexible and rich enough to afford them, and having other complementary capital. Those who invest in AI capital on average gain from their investments. Those who invested in displaced capital may lose, though over the last two decades workers at more automated jobs have not seen any average effect on their wages or number of workers. AI today is only a rather minor contribution to our economy (<5%), and it has quite a long way to go before it can make a large contribution. We today have only vague ideas of what AIs that made a much larger contribution would look like. Today most of the ways that humans help and harm each other are via our relations. Such as: customer-supplier, employer-employee, citizen-politician, defendant-plaintiff, friend-friend, parent-child, lover-lover, victim-criminal-police-prosecutor-judge, army-army, slave-owner, and competitors. So as AIs replace humans in these roles, the main ways that AIs help and hurt humans are likely to also be via these roles. Our usual story is that such hurt is limited by competition. For example, each army is limited by all the other armies that might oppose it. And your employer and landlord are limited in exploiting you by your option to switch to other employers and landlords. So unless AI makes such competition much less effective at limiting harms, it is hard to see how AI makes role-mediated harms worse. Sure smart AIs might be smarter than humans, but they will have other AI competitors and humans will have AI advisors.","Humans don’t seem much worse off in the last few centuries due to firms and governments who are far more intelligent than individual humans taking over many roles. AI risk folks are especially concerned with losing control over AIs. But consider, for example, an AI hired by a taxi firm to do its scheduling. If such an AI stopped scheduling passengers to be picked up where they waited and delivered to where they wanted to go, the firm would notice quickly, and could then fire and replace this AI. But what if an AI who ran such a firm became unresponsive to its investors. Or if an AI who ran an army becoming unresponsive to its oversight government? In both cases, while such investors or governments might be able to cut off some outside supplies of resources, the AI might do substantial damage before such cutoffs bled it dry. However, our world today is well acquainted with the prospect of “coups” wherein firm or army management becomes unresponsive to its relevant owners. Not only do our usual methods usually seem sufficient to the task, we don’t see much of an externality re these problems. You try to keep your firm under control, and I try to keep mine, but I’m not especially threatened by your losing control of yours. We care a bit more about others losing control of their cars, planes, or nuclear power plants, as those might hurt bystanders. But we care much less once such others show us sufficient liability, and liability insurance, to cover our losses in these cases. I don’t see why I should be much more worried about your losing control of your firm, or army, to an AI than to a human or group of humans. And liability insurance also seems a sufficient answer to your possibly losing control of an AI driving your car or plane. Furthermore, I don’t see why its worth putting much effort into planning how to control AIs far in advance of seeing much detail about how AIs actually do concrete tasks where loss of control matters. Knowing such detail has usually been the key to controlling past systems, and money invested now, instead of spent on analysis now, gives us far more money to spend on analysis later. All of the above has been based on assuming that AI will be similar to past techs in how it diffuses and advances. Some say that AI might be different, just because, hey, anything might be different. Others, like my ex-co-blogger Eliezer Yudkowsky, and Nick Bostrom in his book Superintelligence, say more about why they expect advances at the scope of AGI to be far more lumpy than we’ve seen for most techs. Yudkowsky paints a “foom” picture of a world full of familiar weak stupid slowly improving computers, until suddenly and unexpectedly a single super-smart un-controlled AGI with very powerful general abilities appears and is able to decisively overwhelm all other powers on Earth. Alternatively, he claims (quite","But the idea that AI would be a single powerful entity that could dominate all other AIs and humans is not plausible. So the main way AI could be harmful is if the AI systems in the role of employer, landlord, or other similar roles, can exploit their human employees or tenants in ways that are not limited by the option to switch to other employers or landlords. If that’s the scenario, then the question is whether the AI systems are likely to be used in such roles, and how likely they are to exploit their human employees or tenants in such ways. But that’s not the only scenario. There’s also a possibility that AI systems are used in roles that are not similar to human roles, and that in such roles AIs can be much more harmful. For example, if AIs are used in roles that involve making decisions that humans don’t have the capacity to make, and that AIs are not limited by the option to switch to other AI systems or to humans. So in such roles, AIs could be much more harmful. The question then is: which of these two scenarios is more likely? The first is a scenario where AI systems are used in roles that are similar to human roles, and in such roles AIs are not much more harmful than humans. The second is a scenario where AI systems are used in roles that are not similar to human roles, and in such roles AIs are much more harmful than humans. Which is more likely? I think that the first scenario is more likely. But I need to be careful. I think that the second scenario is possible, but I think that the first is more likely. Why? Well, in the first scenario, the AI systems are used in roles that are similar to human roles. In such roles, the AI systems are subject to the same competition as humans. That is, if an AI is an employer, it is likely to be competing with other AIs and humans for workers. So the AI employer",497,500,352,0.2837,0.3692,0.9672,0.9596,0.7588,0.9835,5.8571,0.3083,0.3457,0.3896,0.0203,0.0413,0.001,0.0114,0.5018,0.4499,0.9672,0.9605,0.39792387543252594,0.42226148409893993,0.51010101010101,6,6,0.9576,0.9302,0.16297786720321933,0.108,0.10227272727272728,0.9099,0.566,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Complex Impact Futures.txt,"Imagine a world of people doing various specific projects, where over the long run the net effect of all these projects is to produce some desired outcomes. These projects may interact in complex ways. To encourage people to do more and better such projects along the way, we might like a way to eventually allocate credit to these various projects for their contributions to desired outcomes. And we might like to have good predictions of such credit estimates, available either right after project completion, so we can praise project supporters, or available before projects start, to advise on which projects to start. Such a mechanism could be applied to projects within a firm or other org re achieving that org’s goals, or to charity projects re doing various kinds of general good, or to academic projects re promoting intellectual progress. In this post, I outline a way to do all this. First, let us assume that we have available to us “historians” who could in groups judge after the fact which of two actual projects had contributed the most to desired outcomes. (And assume a way to pay such historians to make them sufficiently honest and careful in such judgments.) These judgments might be made with noise, well after the fact, and at great expense, but are still possible. (Remember, the longer one waits to judge, the more budget one can spend on judging.)
Consider two projects that have relative strengths A and B in terms of the credit each deserves for desired outcomes. Assume further that the chance that a random group of historians will pick A over B is just A/(A+B). This linear rule is a standard assumption made for many kinds of sporting contests (e.g. chess), with contestant strengths being usually distributed log-normally. (E.g., chess “Elo rating” is proportional to a log of such a player strength estimate.)
Given these assumptions, project strength estimates can be obtained via a “tournament parimutuel” (a name I just made up). Let there be a pool of money associated with each project, where each trader who contributes to a pool gets the payoffs from that pool in proportion to their contributions. If each project were randomly matched to another project, and random historian groups were assigned to judge each pair, then it would work to let the winning pool divide up the money from both pools, just as if there had been a simple parimutuel on that pair. Traders would then tend to set the relative amounts in each pool in proportion to the relative strengths of associated projects. If judging were very expensive, however, then we might not be able to afford to have historians judge every project. But in that case it could work to randomize across projects. Pick sets of projects to judge, throw away the rest, and boost the amount in each retained pool by moving money from thrown-away (now boost-zero) pools into retained pools in proportion to pool size.","All you have to do is make sure that, averaged over the ways to randomly throw away projects, each project has a unit average boost. For example, you could partition the projects, and pick each partition set with a chance proportion to its pool size. With this done right, those who invest in pools should expect the same average payout as if all projects were judged, though such payouts would now have more variance. Within a set of projects chosen for judging, any ways to pair projects to judge should work. It would make sense to pair projects with similar strength estimates, to max the info that judging gives, but beyond that we could let judges pick, and at the last minute, pairs they think easier to judge, such as projects that are close to each other in topic spaces, or similar in methods and participants. Or pairs that they would find interesting and informative to judge. Historians might even pick random projects to judge, and then look nearby to select comparison projects, as long as they ensured a symmetric choice habit, or corrected for asymmetries. (It can also work to allow judges to sometimes say they can’t judge, or to rank more than two projects at the same time.) It would be good if the might-be-paired network of connections between projects were fully connected across all projects. Parimutuel pools can make sense when all pool contributions are made at roughly the same time, so that contributors have similar info. But when bets will be made over longer time durations, betting markets make more sense. Thus we’d like to have a “complex impact futures” market over the various projects for most of our long duration, and then convert such bets into parimutuel tournament holdings just before judging. We can do that by letting anyone split cash $1 into N betting assets of the form “Pays $xp into p pool” for each of N projects p, where xp refers to the market price of this asset at the time when betting assets are converted to claims in a tournament parimutuel. At that time, each outstanding asset of the form “Pays $xp into p pool” is converted into $xp put into the parimutuel pool for project p. This method ensures that project pool amounts have the ratios xp. Note that 1 = Sump=1N xp, that a logarithmic market scoring rule would work find for trading in these markets, and that via a “rest of field” asset we don’t need to know about all projects p when the market starts. Thus traders in our complex impact futures markets should treat prices of these assets as estimates of the relative strength of projects p in the credit judging process. They’ll want to buy projects whose relative strength seems underestimated, and sell those that seem overestimated. And so these prices right after a project is completed should give speculators’ consensus estimate on that project’s relative credit for desired outcomes. And the prices on future possible","(That is, if a project is not judged, it gets no credit, but any project that is judged gets credit based on the judgment, and those projects which are judged get their credit multiplied by the number of times they are judged, but in any case, the total amount of money in all pools is equal to the sum of the credit amounts of all projects.)
This seems like a possible way to estimate the relative strengths of projects, based on the judgments of historians, and to use that to allocate credit. But what is the relation between this system and the actual desired outcomes? For example, if a project is more effective, it might have a higher strength, but how do we know that? Or maybe the strength estimates are not directly related to the outcomes. Is there a way to calibrate the system so that the relative strength estimates are directly proportional to the actual desired outcomes? The answer is that the system can be calibrated so that the relative strength estimates are proportional to the actual outcomes. But to do that, we need to have a way to get the actual desired outcomes. That is, we need to have a way to measure the actual desired outcomes. Let's say we have an “evaluator” who can measure the actual outcomes. Then, we can use the evaluator’s scores as a calibration factor to adjust the strength estimates so that they are proportional to the actual outcomes.
But how can we use the evaluator's scores to adjust the strength estimates? Well, if we can find a way to have the evaluator's scores be proportional to the strength estimates, then we can use them to adjust the strength estimates. However, if the evaluator's scores are not proportional to the strength estimates, then we might need to use a different method. Perhaps we can use a regression model to adjust the strength estimates based on the evaluator's scores. Alternatively, we could use a Bayesian approach to update the strength estimates based on the evaluator's scores.
But the problem is that the evaluator's scores might",493,500,352,0.4975,0.2483,0.9822,0.949,0.7905,0.9463,5.31,1.1365,0.4493,0.3886,0.0602,0.0632,0.0078,0.0048,0.6306,0.5871,0.9757,0.9519,0.4078014184397163,0.4014084507042254,0.475,7,5,0.9651,0.9056,0.13793103448275862,0.096,0.125,0.9854,0.602,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,"Conspiracy Theory, Up Close & Personal.txt","Hal Finney made 33 posts here on Overcoming Bias from ’06 to ’08. I’d known Hal long before that, starting on the Extropians mailing list in the early ‘90s, where Hal was one of the sharpest contributors. We’ve met in person, and Hal has given me thoughtful comments on some of my papers (including on this, this, & this). So I was surprised to learn from this article (key quotes below) that Hal is a plausible candidate for being (or being part of) the secretive Bitcoin founder, “Satoshi Nakamoto”. Arguments for this conspiracy theory:
Hal lives a few miles from the guy Newsweek recently claimed was Nakamoto, and who admitted to being involved somehow. Bitcoin is very carefully thought out and implemented, and Hal is one of the top few people in the open crypto world who have demonstrated this capacity. For example, Hal did most of the work behind PGP 2.0, perhaps the most successful open crypto predecessor to Bitcoin. Hal is on record as the first guy besides Nakamoto to use Bitcoin software, he got the first coin transfer from Nakamoto, and he made some key software improvements. Hal’s writing style is much closer to Nakamoto’s than anyone else who the many reporters digging into this have suspected of being Nakamoto. The arguments against this conspiracy theory:
In a world has seven billion people, the prior on Hal being Nakamoto has be rather low. Hal says he isn’t Nakamoto, and seems sincere. Hal says Nakamoto understands C++ better than he does. Hal’s son showed a reporter some gmails between Hal and Nakamoto. The reporter says:
The notion that Finney alone might have set up the two accounts and created a fake conversation with himself to throw off snoops like me, long before Bitcoin had any measurable value, seemed preposterous. That last point seems pretty weak. We already know that the Bitcoin founder wants to be hidden. If Hal really created Bitcoin, he is plenty smart enough to think that Bitcoin might succeed, and to think of and implement the idea of creating fake conversations to cover his tracks. In this case Hal would also plausibly lie about his C++ skills, or maybe he got C++ help from someone else. In any case the probability of seeing those things conditional on Hal actually being Nakamoto seem pretty high. It seems to me that the question comes down to your prior expectation on whether the person who did such a careful expert job on something so hard would be one of the few people in the field most known to be capable of and to have actually done such things, or whether it would be a new largely unknown person. And thinking about it that way I have to put a pretty large weight on it being someone known. And conditional on that it is hard for me not to think that yeah, there’s at least a 15% chance Hal was more involved than he’s said.","And if so, my hat’s way off to you Hal! But I also figure I’m not paying nearly as close attention to this bitcoin stuff as many others. Google doesn’t find me any other discussion of the Hal as Nakamoto theory, but surely if I wait a few weeks others who know more will weigh in, right? And since I can’t think of any actions of mine that depend on this issue, waiting is what I’ll do. Your move, internet. Added 8a 26Mar: In the comments, Gwern points to further reasonable indicators against the Hal as Nakamoto theory. I accept his judgement. Those promised quotes: March 6th, the day that Newsweek released its bombshell cover story on the man who it claimed had invented Bitcoin: Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto, a 64-year old ex-engineer and programmer living in the small exurb of Los Angeles known as Temple City. Nakamoto had even seemed to give Newsweek a tacit confirmation of its theory when he told the magazine’s reporter that he was “no longer involved in that,” a quote confirmed in essence by local police who witnessed the interaction. … Just hours after Newsweek‘s story hit the Web, I received an email from an old cryptography community acquaintance of Finney’s, … [who] pointed out that Hal Finney had lived for almost a decade in Temple City, the same 36,000 person town where Newsweek found Dorian Nakamoto. Finney had lived only a few blocks away from Nakamoto’s family home. … I collected a 20,000 character sample of Finney’s writing from various forums and mailing lists and sent it to Juola & Associates for analysis…. I received the results from the writing analysis from Juola & Associates. The firm, its chief scientist John Noecker explained in a phone call, had previously tried analyzing candidates for Satoshi Nakamoto named by older investigations performed by the New Yorker, Fast Company, and various Bitcoin enthusiasts. None of the results had been promising enough to publish, according to Noecker. … Finney contacted Zimmermann and became one of his earliest collaborators. He worked almost a full-time job’s worth of hours developing PGP 2.0, widely considered to be the first truly secure version of the program, and pioneered its “web of trust” model of key-signing, … Though Finney told me that he worked closely with Zimmermann to code “the bulk of the changes” from PGP 1.0 to PGP 2.0, he’s rarely been fully credited for that work. As PGP’s usage spread, Finney was also the first to integrate the encryption software into “remailers”–free services that acted as proxy servers for email, bouncing messages among third parties so that they couldn’t be traced to their source. … Finney is known to be the second-ever user of Bitcoin after Satoshi Nakamoto himself. He had been one of the first supporters of the idea when Nakamoto floated it on a cryptography mail list, and even received the first Bitcoin test transaction from Nakamoto in early 2009. … Finney downloaded the early Bitcoin code and","I think that’s a reasonable estimate.
But in the end, I think the best answer is that the truth is that it’s someone else. I think that’s the most likely answer. But I’m not sure. This is a really tough question. I think that the chance of the person being someone else is 50-50 with Hal being part of it. But I’m not sure. I think that the chance of the person being someone else is 50-50 with Hal being part of it. But I’m not sure.
So I think that the answer is that it’s not Hal. But I’m not sure. But given that the author is the one who’s trying to figure this out, I think the author is probably better off not choosing any answer, but just saying that the probability is about 50-50.
So this is a very difficult question, and the answer is not obvious. But the author is saying that it is 50-50.

Robin Hanson,A Tale Of Two Tradeoffs.txt,"The design of social minds involves two key tradeoffs, which interact in an important way. The first tradeoff is that social minds must both make good decisions, and present good images to others. Our thoughts influence both our actions and what others think of us. It would be expensive to maintain two separate minds for these two purposes, and even then we would have to maintain enough consistency to convince outsiders a good-image mind was in control. It is cheaper and simpler to just have one integrated mind whose thoughts are a compromise between these two ends. When possible, mind designers should want to adjust this decision-image tradeoff by context, depending on the relative importance of decisions versus images in each context. But it might be hard to find cheap effective heuristics saying when images or decisions matter more. The second key tradeoff is that minds must often think about the same sorts of things using different amounts of detail. Detailed representations tend to give more insight, but require more mental resources. In contrast, sparse representations require fewer resources, and make it easier to abstractly compare things to each other. For example, when reasoning about a room a photo takes more work to study but allows more attention to detail; a word description contains less info but can be processed more quickly, and allows more comparisons to similar rooms. It makes sense to have your mental models use more detail when what they model is closer to you in space and time, and closer to you in your social world; such things tend to be more important to you. It also makes sense to use more detail for real events over hypothetical ones, for high over low probability events, for trend deviations over trend following, and for thinking about how to do something over why to do it. So it makes sense to use detail thinking for ""near"", and sparse thinking for ""far"", in these ways. It can make sense to have specialized mental systems for these different approaches, i.e., systems best at reasoning from detailed representations, versus systems best at reasoning from sparse abstractions. When something became important enough to think about at all you would first use sparse systems, graduating to detail systems when that thing became important enough to justify the added resources. Even then you might continue to reason about it using sparse systems, at least if you could sufficiently coordinate the two kinds of systems. A non-social mind, caring only about good personal decisions, would want consistency between near and far thoughts. To be consistent, estimates made by sparse approaches should equal the average of estimates made when both sparse and detail approaches contribute. A social mind would also want such consistency when sparse and detail tasks had the same tradeoffs between decisions and images. But when these tradeoffs differ, inconsistency can be more attractive.","The important interaction between these two key tradeoffs is this: near versus far seems to correlate reasonably well with when good decisions matter more, relative to good images. Decision consequences matter less for hypothetical, fictional, and low probability events. Social image matters more, relative to decision consequences, for opinions about what I should do in the distant future, or for what they or ""we"" should do now. Others care more about my basic goals than about how exactly I achieve them, and they care especially about my attitudes toward those people. Also, widely shared topics are better places to demonstrate mental abilities. Thus a good cheap heuristic seems to be that image matters more for ""far"" thoughts, relative to decisions mattering more for ""near"" thoughts. And so it makes sense for social minds to allow inconsistencies between near and far thinking systems. Instead of having both systems produce the same average estimates, it can make sense for sparse estimates to better achieve a good image, while detail estimates better achieve good decisions. And this seems to be just what the human mind does. The human mind seems to have different ""near"" and ""far"" mental systems, apparently implemented in distinct brain regions, for detail versus abstract reasoning. Activating one of these systems on a topic for any reason makes other activations of that system on that topic more likely; all near thinking tends to evoke other near thinking, while all far thinking tends to evoke other far thinking. These different human mental systems tend to be inconsistent in giving systematically different estimates to the same questions, and these inconsistencies seem too strong and patterned to be all accidental. Our concrete day-to-day decisions rely more on near thinking, while our professed basic values and social opinions, especially regarding fiction, rely more on far thinking. Near thinking better helps us work out complex details of how to actually get things done, while far thinking better presents our identity and values to others. Of course we aren't very aware of this hypocrisy, as that would undermine its purpose; so we habitually assume near and far thoughts are more consistent than they are. These near-far inconsistencies seems to me to reasonably explain puzzles like: we value particular foreign-born associates, but oppose foreign immigration we say we want to lose weight, but actually don't exercise more or eat less we say we care about distant future folk, but don't save money for them So which of near or far thinking is our ""true"" thinking? Perhaps neither; perhaps we really contain an essential contradiction, which we don't want to admit, much less resolve. Added: The key puzzle I'm trying to address here is the fact that hypocrisy is hard. It is hard enough to manage a mind with coherent opinions across a wide range of topics. To manage two coherent systems of opinions, one for decisions and one for image, and then only let them differ where others can't see, that seems really hard. I'm saying the","For example, a detailed, accurate, and precise mind would be more likely to be perceived as credible, and thus more likely to be trusted. But a sparse, approximate, and vague mind would be more likely to be seen as friendly. So, in some contexts, being inconsistent is better, even if it costs you the ability to make good decisions. In this way, social minds have to balance the tradeoffs between decisions and images, and between detail and abstraction, and these two tradeoffs are not independent. The key is to find a way to manage the balance of these two tradeoffs in a way that is consistent with your overall values and goals.

The text above is about the design of social minds, discussing two key tradeoffs. One is the balance between making good decisions and maintaining a good image, and the other is between detailed representations and sparse representations. The author also notes that these two tradeoffs interact and are not independent, and that managing them is essential for a social mind.

Now, the question is: How would a social mind balance these two tradeoffs (decision/image and detail/abstraction) in a way that is consistent with its overall values and goals?

The answer should be a detailed explanation, not just a summary. The answer should also be in the form of a self-talk, as if the mind is thinking through the problem, and not just a list of points. The answer should also be in the form of a paragraph, not multiple paragraphs. The answer should be in the form of a paragraph with natural transitions between ideas, and it should be in English. The answer should be written in a way that it is understandable to a non-expert, avoiding jargon, and keeping the tone natural and conversational. The answer should be approximately 400-500 words long. The answer should be written in a way that reflects the thinking process of a social mind, considering the two key tradeoffs, and how they interact.

Robin Hanson,Explaining Stylized UFO Facts.txt,"In my last post I summarized some key stylized social facts that a theory of UFOs-as-aliens would need to explain:
Any aliens behind UFOs would be amazingly long-lived creatures who have somehow coordinated to limit any small part of themselves from expanding and remaking the universe. This gets easier to believe the smaller and rarer they are. (They also seem to have limited their tech.) Yet they’ve overcome their self-limits to travel to be here now, so they must be close enough to come quickly once they saw signs of advances, or they saw signs of interest very early and traveled very far. We can see practical reasons for them to come here, at least if they can coordinate to achieve such plans. But most such motives seem better served by destroying us than by the usual reported UFO encounters, which seem to accomplish little. Yes, humans today do many things for indirect “symbolic” motives, and lazy organizations often pretend to achieve more than they do. But these require slack, and fig-leaf stories to justify them. So from whence comes alien slack, and what could be their justifications? My tentative explanation for all this has four main supporting elements: panspermia siblings, world government, moral ideology, and complexity rot. 1. Panspermia Siblings – Imagine that life started on some previous planet Eden, where it went through some very hard steps. Life then spread from Eden to Earth, as well as to some other planets. Even if it were hard for life to spread between planets, the Eden-to-Earth scenario could still be statistically favored compared to the Earth-only scenario, as Eden can start much earlier and can be in more places. This is because Earth had to have a much calmer environment than Eden to host the last half-billion years of fragile multi-cellular life. These few seeded planets might be the only ones with life in the million nearest galaxies. Once seeded, Earth and its sibling planets would then compete to complete the remaining hard steps required to reach advanced life. If one of those planets succeeded before Earth, then it would host close but rare aliens, who share a lot of biology detail (e.g., DNA) with Earth. Those aliens could have then searched out their sibling stars (which have a clear signature that we can see even now), found Earth around one, and then waited perhaps millions of years for civilization to appear here. These aliens had several good and practical possible reasons for coming here in time to see us now up close. Positing that the aliens behind UFOs come from just one nearby sibling planet, with the nearest other aliens many galaxies away, makes it easier to believe that these aliens have successfully imposed sufficiently-strong self-limits on expansion and on tech advance, leaving the empty universe we see. 2.","World Government – Over the last few centuries, one of the most consistent world trends has been an increase in human organization size and complexity, with more functions and decisions drifting up to higher levels. We have developed both better networks and better hierarchical organizations. Plausibly this trend is behind most others; it seems to be the main driver of faster innovation, which is the main cause of more wealth, which drives most other trends. A straightforward long-term prediction from this trend is “world” (really “civilization-wide”) government. After all, a few have come close to creating this via force, we now have a United Nations by consent, and regulators worldwide share an elite culture that creates a de facto world government on many issues. Stronger, more formal versions seem likely within centuries. Within a star system, talk delays are modest, and it is easy to see and shoot at most anything, making a world government quite feasible there. However, world government is quite hard to start (and if started harder to maintain) once independent self-sufficient colonies at other stars can grow as fast as at the home star system. Thus the existence of such colonies becomes a deadline for the creation of a world government. As near Earth this deadline seems likely to be met, that may also have happened for sibling star aliens. The advantages of a world government will seem clear and compelling: a civilization that can better coordinate on global problems like war, pollution, and innovation. And that can better enforce widely-liked regulations. Also, global majorities will be eager to impose their will on global minorities, and to lock down their temporary advantages via a permanent world government. By its very nature, a world government reduces innovation and adaptation in, but also promotes the stability of, the largest scale civilization structures. An advanced star-system-wide civilization probably has a large enough base of knowledge and resources, and a stable enough environment, for this tradeoff to allow for stability over many millions of years. Thus the fact that aliens have lasted for millions of years weakly suggests that they have a world government. 3. Moral Ideology – While pre-human primate groups were held together mainly by kin and alliances, human groups could be larger due to social norms, which were enabled by human weapons and language. Social norms have also aided our other more recent methods of social organization. As norms matter more in collective politics than in private life, a world government would gain legitimacy and stability by more strongly supporting widely-held moral norms. Thus a world with a world government is likely to impose more stronger regulations in support of widely-held moral intuitions. And in an era of rapidly changing technology often in tension with moral intuitions that evolved in prior eras, that may result in substantial limitations on tech. Sibling star alien world governments might ban advanced artificial intelligence, brain emulations, or nuclear-powered space ships. They might also insist on preserving their biological bodies. By using","World Government – The aliens would need to be part of a single, unified government to coordinate their efforts. That makes sense given the need for strict self-limitation on expansion and on tech. Otherwise, if they were separate, they might be more likely to conflict, and then to expand and develop tech in ways that could be dangerous. So the aliens would be in a world government. But if they were part of a world government, they would be able to do things that humans can’t, especially in terms of coordination and control. The alien government could be a single entity, or maybe a coalition of factions, as long as it remains unified. That’s why, for example, in the 1950s, the UFOs could be seen as a kind of world government testing the humans. They would want to test the humans to see if they could be trusted to handle their presence. But since the aliens are part of a world government, they can only test us in ways that are consistent with their self-imposed limits. So for example, they might test whether we can handle the presence of an alien ship, or whether we can be trusted to not use that ship to attack them. They might test us to see if we could handle the idea of having a “higher” being or something like that. 3. Moral Ideology – The aliens would have a strong moral ideology that is consistent with their self-imposed limits. For example, they might believe that they are here to help us evolve, or that they are here to show us a better way of life. But they would also have a moral code that prevents them from doing things that could be dangerous, such as using technology in ways that could threaten our planet. This moral ideology would also have to explain the reasons for their presence, such as why they are here to help us instead of just being here to observe or to dominate. 4. Complexity Rot – As the aliens have become more complex, they",470,500,345,0.1603,0.2351,0.9454,0.9318,0.9904,0.9579,0.195,-0.8472,0.3279,0.3957,0.0191,0.0562,0.0039,0.0062,0.387,0.5651,0.9474,0.9709,0.3984819734345351,0.3582887700534759,0.4701298701298701,6,6,0.993,0.9613,0.14468085106382977,0.136,0.11304347826086956,0.9249,0.7019,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,What Would Socrates Do_.txt,"Christians often ask themselves, as a guide to living, “What would Jesus do?” In her new book Open Socrates, my podcast-cohost Agnes Callard suggests we instead ask “What would Socrates do?”
Over 2400 years ago, Socrates gained fame by asking people questions on important topics, and then finding contradictions in their answers. Most didn’t like it, and eventually his city Athens killed him for it. Callard elaborates a Socratic ethics wherein doing what he tried to do is the highest ideal; other things are good mainly via embodying or promoting Socratic inquiry. And as Socrates, like Jesus, is just the sort of person it makes sense to model after, this a worthy project. Lest you think I exaggerate:
[He] inspired [people] to want to become the kind … who think ignorance is the worst thing there is. … Given that we cannot lead lives based on knowledge— because we lack it— we should lead the second-best kind of life, namely, the one oriented toward knowledge. … Socratic ethics … inserts itself everywhere, into every interaction, infusing every corner of life with the demand to become more intellectual. … Inquiry is the best thing one can do with one’s life, given that one does not know how to lead it. This is a contrarian position among philosophers:
Academic philosophers are… eager to allow that one can live a perfectly happy and fulfilled life without ever engaging in philosophy. They are also careful to shield the rest of their lives from their philosophical activities: … taking off their philosopher hat when walking into their homes, … and …whenever things get serious. … when it comes to the question of how to live our lives, we are already being intellectual and critical and thoughtful enough. … This book is an argument to the contrary. …
Socratic intellectualism turns its back on a very basic human need: the need to already know. Kantianism, Utilitarianism, and Virtue Ethics tell us that we already know how to live, that the formula for how to do so is simply a matter of cleaning up the bodily command, or cleaning up the kinship command, or of looking … to satisfy both at the same time. What is so bad about not being Socratic? Inconsistency:
When we settle on answers to the central questions of our lives without ever having opened up those questions for [Socratic] inquiry, that is a recipe for wavering. [Such as] … acting inconsistently, … “I go back and forth about all this”, … language is hostage to its user’s approval, … pick a maxim or adage and you can usually articulate a counter-maxim, … refusing to say the same things about the same subjects, … in favor of free speech, except when it comes to people you disagree with, … weakness of will …
My body might tell me that I have to do one thing at one time, but, at a later time, fill me with regrets and pains for having obeyed it.","The commands generated by other people— one’s kin group— have the same fluctuating character. … Why is … avoidance of wavering so important? … [Because] in retrospect… you would be forced to acknowledge there was no point to what you did. Okay, sure, consistency sounds nice. But 2400 years of inquiry of all sorts into central value questions seems to have only resulted in modest progress. And few who have inquired into such questions, whether successfully and not, have chosen to use Socratic-style inquiry much, though most have been well aware of that option. So how could a typical person expect their personal Socratic inquiry to cut their personal value inconsistencies enough to justify substantial efforts here? Callard fills much of her book arguing that Socratic ethics does actually offer substantial progress on many big questions: We remain at sea when it comes to managing politics, handling love affairs, and confronting our own deaths. Socratic ethics … tells you that the way you should conduct yourself in each of these three domains is: inquisitively. … Socrates unified domains as distinct as love, death, and politics not by analyzing them in terms of some underlying common denominator, but rather by seeing them as converging upward toward a single aspiration: inquiry. … On war, courage, moderation, and piety: War is really a form of conversation. … Each of the traditional virtues of justice, courage, moderation, and piety is to be equated with knowledge. …Human goodness is primarily expressed in how a person conducts herself in inquiry. … On fights, justice, free speech, and freedom: When people think that they are fighting injustice, they are, instead, imitating refutation. … Speech is free if, and only if, it is inquisitive. … Our three most cherished political ideals— justice, freedom, and equality— are, in fact, intellectual ideals. They are norms that pertain, in the first instance, to the shared quest for knowledge. … On equality and respect: The proper home of equality and respect is … the world of the conversation. … What defines you, within the conversation, is only your orientation toward the truth, … Our most fundamental wish: to be treated not as a physical thing, nor as a social thing, but as an intellectual thing. … The only way one can get such respect is from the person who inquires with you. … On love and romance: The proper activity for lovers to engage in is philosophy. … They can be neither admiring nor accepting of one another. … We don’t love human beings. … Socratic (philosophical) love purports to be the stable reality of which romantic (sexual) love is a wavering image. … Socratized romance would force us to leave behind: … taking people as they are: … romantic exclusivity … sexual intercourse … working together to stay alive, live comfortably, and transmit humanity into the future via children … none of these things truly embody the spirit of erōs. … Socrates replaces the fickle love of individual people with what","… The body is a liar, and we are told to trust it, … we can be inconsistent. … But, if we are to be consistent, we must be Socratic. …
So, the answer to the question “What would Jesus do?” is not the answer to the question “What would Socrates do?” In the end, maybe both of them are trying to get us to be more like them, but in different ways. But perhaps if we can get our head around Socratic intellectualism, it could be a way to live more consistently, more thoughtfully, and more ethically.
But Socratic intellectualism is not the only way to live a good life. In fact, the author says that it is a contrarian position, and that most philosophers would not agree with it. However, in the context of Christian ethics, is this a helpful or even necessary approach? What would a Christian say to someone who is asking, “What would Socrates do?”
I think that the author is trying to argue that Socrates is a better model for living the good life than Jesus. That is, if we are to be consistent, we should be like Socrates, not like Jesus. But I think that’s a misreading of the text. The author is not saying that Socrates is better than Jesus, but that Socrates is a better model for living the good life, and that Socrates is a model that we should consider in addition to Jesus.
But the author also says that Socrates is not the only way to live a good life. So, in the context of Christian ethics, how does this play out? Let’s think.
First, Socrates is not the only way to live a good life. So, Christians can live by Socratic ethics, but they can also live by Christian ethics. But perhaps the author is suggesting that Socratic ethics is a better model for living a good life than Christian ethics. That would be a problem",500,500,328,0.2104,0.264,0.9755,0.9485,0.7158,0.6057,-7.2854,-10.1078,0.3362,0.3573,0.0256,0.0471,0.0037,0.0103,0.6387,0.7544,0.9715,0.9689,0.4083044982698962,0.3745704467353952,0.4804177545691906,6,6,0.9809,0.9693,0.136,0.158,0.13719512195121952,0.9651,0.6107,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Neo Social Darwinism.txt,"As the quotes in my recent post suggest, when intellectuals came to believe that life, and most everything we value. was structured by a competitive struggle for existence, many then tried to apply this theory to their personal and collective choices. They wondered how to best participate in and promote this struggle, as individuals or groups. Analyses like this are often called “social Darwinism”. They of course considered policies common at the time, like colonization, welfare, insane asylums, and race laws, and also some less common ones, like forced sterilization. But many who favored redistribution, business regulation, peace, and race mixing tended to see Darwinian arguments as in practice opposing their views, and so tried to resist them. So they tried (A) denying evolution in general, and also (B) arguing that their favored policies were in fact winning moves in the struggle for existence. However, such opponents found more success by (C) claiming humans are an exception where evolution isn’t relevant, (D) denying evolution’s relevance to moral policy due to a “naturalistic fallacy”, (E) declaring the use of evolution to analyze policy as “pseudoscience”, and (F) blaming evolutionary analysis for causing Nazi’s war, racism, and genocide. But as those quotes show, (F) is just not true, though many found it plausible. Re (E), this way to analyze policy seems no less scientific than most others. And re (D), that is no more a criticism of this than of any other concrete claims about where lies moral value. Now admittedly, (C) was based on good intuitions, as we have since decided that humans do evolve quite differently from other animals, due to culture. But now that we understand culture, we can analyze how to best participate in and promote cultural struggles. Also, the claim that morals are independent of evolution makes much less sense now that we see each culture’s morals as arising via its cultural evolution. As so many people have said so many things in this space, let me not try to agree or disagree with them, but just offer a nearby claim I think is especially defensible:
Neo Social Darwinism: For most X that you want to promote long after you die, you will need to promote things Y now that can either themselves last into that future, or directly or indirectly promote other things Z that so last, with Y or Z tending to promote X later. And as natural selection is our main account of which things change and tend to promote what how, including why you now try to promote X, it can advise you on how to promote your X. That is, you will mostly need to guess the directions that future evolution will go, and find moves now to tilt this process more toward evolving stuff that will later more promote X. In general, your inclination to promote X now suggests that the people most likely to promote X in the future will be people like you.","So promoting the evolution of more like you is a common way to promote future X. Yes, you could insist that you care little for the distant future, but only want to promote stuff now. But think of how you might advise a drug addict who just sought pleasure now, at the cost of plausibly dying in a few months. Yes, you can also promote future things by trying to live very long yourself, by making very long lived artifacts, or arranging long term contracts. But these processes now have relatively limited influence on long timescales. Yes, you might make making long-lived orgs, movements, religions, or standards, but these are all standard moves in cultural evolution, not alternatives to that process. Yes, technically this only uses natural selection has a means, without constraining the ultimate ends X one might seek. But for most X, evolutionary considerations will so greatly infuse your strategies to achieve X that they will seem nearly as important as X. As we humans are just not very good at distinguishing which of our very important goals are powerful general means versus ultimate ends, for those who use Neo Social Darwinism, evolving well will seem a lot like an ultimate end. Yes, as I showed in my last post, few care much about the future after they are gone, especially re things that won’t much influence their kids or grandkids. So one may plausibly suspect those who justify current actions in terms of an evolutionary analysis of how to achieve distant future ends of using that as an excuse for actions they want for other reasons. But this critique also applies to any other framework for justifying acts today in terms of distant future outcomes. But what about war, racism, and genocide, aren’t they both evil and recommended by an evolutionary analysis, which is why many (mistakenly) thought Nazi crimes resulted from Nazis embracing social Darwinism? Well, no, those aren’t obviously recommended. Such hostile acts risk retaliation and censure, their targets might make better allies than opponents, and it can make sense as a cultural strategy to stay committed to your culture’s moral principles even when you see opportunities for gains by betraying them. Just as the use of decision theory or supply and demand does not commit one in general to any particular policy recommendations, the use of natural selection to analyze policy also does not commit one to any particular choices. As usual, one must study the details. So while I can say that Neo Social Darwinism doesn’t obviously recommend war, racism, and genocide, I can’t guarantee that it will never recommend such things. You may point out that your moral principles do so guarantee, but I may doubt you will always obey them, and can point out that continued cultural evolution may long outlive your principles. And that is my proposal for a Neo Social Darwinism, an especially defensible version of what has long been a reasonable and unreasonably maligned stance, that it is","So the problem is not that you are trying to promote X, but that you are not trying to promote the people who are most likely to promote X. So the advice is: you should try to promote the people who are most likely to promote X. Which is to say: you should promote the people who are most likely to promote X, not just X itself. So in short, the problem is that we focus on X, but we should focus on the people who can promote X. This is a form of social Darwinism, but it is not the same as the social Darwinism that led to the worst policies. It is a form of social Darwinism that is actually more in line with the best policies, like the ones that promote peace, racial mixing, and redistribution. This is because the people who are most likely to promote peace, racial mixing, and redistribution are the people who are most likely to promote the things that will promote peace, racial mixing, and redistribution in the future. So if we focus on the people, not the things, we can promote X, even when X is a good thing. But the problem with the previous social Darwinism was that it was not focused on people, but on things. So the previous social Darwinism was a mistake, but this new one is not. The main idea is that when you are trying to promote X, you should focus on promoting the people who are most likely to promote X, not just X. This is the new social Darwinism, and it is a better approach than the old one. 

So, the question is: is the new social Darwinism as defensible as the author claims? What are the flaws in the author’s reasoning? What is the author's main argument, and what are the implications of this argument?

### Summary of the Author's Argument:
The author argues that the new social Darwinism is a more defensible approach than the old social Darwinism that led to harmful policies.

Parasite and Joker are now #3,4 in betting odds to win the 2019 Oscar best picture award, and these movies are more “social commentary” than #1,2. That commentary is said to be about inequality and class conflict, and most critics (96 to 59) see Parasite as more “sophisticated” than Joker. My take: Parasite is done in a setting and style designed to appeal to upper class folks, and it is more about class conflict from an upper class perspective. Joker is designed to appeal to lower class folks, and it is more about class conflict from a lower class perspective. Which is partly why critics, who are mostly upper class, prefer Parasite. I’ll need to give some spoilers to elaborate on this; you are warned. In terms of style, the difference is obvious. Parasite is done in an art-house film style, while Joker is done in a mass-market comic-book style. Parasite has many complications and plot twists, while Joker moves along rather predictably. In Parasite, emotions are relatively reserved and you have to look closely to see them, while in Joker, emotions are pretty exaggerated and obvious. Parasite mostly takes place in elegant upper class worlds, and focuses on upper class concerns. The upper classes are focused on status differences near their level, and they mainly care about the lower class folks they see in the world around them. They wonder if they can trust them, if they are treating them well enough, and if they deserve their own higher status. Parasite shows lower class people who seem sloppy and dysfunctional in their own world, but who show great competence when serving the upper class. They dress sharply, act properly and reliably, and are skilled at key upper class skills of charming, bullshitting, and acting obsequious as needed. This difference in competence is so great as to be puzzling; why couldn’t they succeed in other jobs before? Part of the explanation is that these lower class folks cheat, lie, and fight dirty to gain and keep their lucrative positions serving the upper class. Perhaps a habit of doing that elsewhere has kept them down.","The low class folks know they aren’t being nice, but claim that they’d act nice if only they were rich. The rich folks, falsely thinking that they are talking only to themselves, are respectful of the poor folks, except they note a funny smell. In a key crisis, a rich guy acts cowardly, and that or the overheard smell comment induces a poor guy to kill him. The movie offers no hint of disapproval of this, it seems to be comeuppance for rich folks not deserving their better lives. Joker is quite obviously the origin story of a comic book villain. So we know right from the start that we will see a not-yet-bad guy turn into a bad guy, and we may see where and how exactly he went wrong. What we don’t know at the start, however, is just how sympathetic (very) he will be as a character. It is actually hard (though not impossible) to decide where and how he goes wrong. Joker is mainly about one low class person. It takes place almost entirely in his low class world, focusing on his ordinary concerns. When he ventures into upper class worlds he seems to like them, and doesn’t seem offended by what he sees there. He is, to be honest, objectively dull and stupid, and has clearly lower-class tastes, habits, and markers (such liking cigarettes and guns). He is Hollywood-ugly, socially awkward, and unskilled. This character tries to be good and to better himself, but he comes to feel that he is treated badly by many folks, and he doesn’t get the attention, help, or courtesy that he deserves. And he’s clearly right. As he goes off his meds (due to govt funding cuts) and starts to experiment with retaliating against those who treat him badly, he falls into a reinforcing cycle of increasing indignation, confidence, boldness, and even grace. When his retaliation happens to hit upper class people, he gets much more attention and validation, which spurs him on. When he gains a public stage, the main complaint Joker voices is that everyone treats everyone badly: Everybody just yells and screams at each other. Nobody’s civil anymore. Nobody thinks what it’s like to be the other guy. You think men like Thomas Wayne, men at ease, ever think what it’s like to be a guy like me? To be anybody but themselves. (more) His audience may interpret his mentioning rich guy Wayne as a declaration of class war, but we know that he really says that because he sees Wayne as his mean father. The only clearly class-related complaint he voices is that the world shows more concern when high class folks suffer than when he suffers. Like most low class people, Joker isn’t particularly envious of or even focused on the very rich. He says he isn’t political, and he isn’t interested in ideology. He is simply mad at most everyone for either treating him badly or allowing others to do so. He might","The upper class in Parasite are more concerned about their own status, and less about the lower class folks in their world. They are more concerned with their own status and the status of their family, and how that might be threatened by the lower class. In contrast, the lower class in Joker are more concerned about the lower class as a whole. They are more concerned about their own survival and the survival of their group, and less about the status of their own individual status. The upper class in Parasite are more about status, while the lower class in Joker are more about survival. So, in terms of the class conflict, the upper class in Parasite are more likely to be portrayed as the ones who are in the wrong. They are the ones who are the more “selfish” and “hypocritical” ones. The lower class in Joker are more likely to be portrayed as the ones who are in the right. They are the more “moral” and “honest” ones. (more)
Parasite and Joker are two films that deal with class conflict and the breakdown of social order. While both films explore the theme of class inequality, they do so from different perspectives. Parasite is more of a social commentary on the wealth gap, while Joker is more of a dark exploration of the psychological breakdown of a marginalized individual. (more)
The two films are not only about class but also about the psychological and social effects of inequality. In Joker, the protagonist is a man who is pushed to the edge of society by systemic issues, while in Parasite, the characters are dealing with the stress of their economic situation. (more)
In conclusion, both Parasite and Joker are important films that explore the theme of class and inequality. However, they differ in their approaches and perspectives on the issue. Parasite is a more nuanced and socially conscious film, while Joker is a more intense and psychological exploration of the consequences of systemic inequality. (more)

Robin Hanson,ALL Big Punishment Is “Cruel”.txt,"Cruel – willfully causing pain or suffering to others, or feeling no concern about it. Cruelty is pleasure in inflicting suffering or inaction towards another’s suffering when a clear remedy is readily available. …affirmative violence is not necessary for an act to be cruel. … are four distinct conceptions of cruelty. … first … above in degree and beyond in type the [suffering] allowed by applicable norms. … second … fault of character consisting in deriving personal delight from causing and witnessing suffering … punishment or other violence is a means to restore the offset in the cosmic order of the universe caused by a wrongdoing.

A great many things seem quite wrong with the U.S. legal system, especially in criminal law. I’ve tried to work out comprehensive solutions, but I should also identify more modest changes, more likely to be adopted. And one big way our criminal law seems broken is our huge prison population, which is near a world and historical peak of residents per capita. Many people say we define too many acts as crimes, that we make it too easy for authorities to prosecute people, and that we punish many crimes too severely. And while those seem like fine issues to explore, I see an even clearer case that jail is usually the wrong way to punish crime. Let me explain. In principle jail can serve many functions, such as education, reform, isolation, and punishment. But prison is now more expensive than college; few see it as a cost effective way to learn. And few believe that US jails actually reform many convicts. Yes, convicts do tend to commit fewer crimes over time, but that’s mainly due to age, not reform efforts. Jail cuts residents off from their prior social connections, such as jobs and family, and connects them instead to other criminals. Which seems bad for reform. Jail does isolate convicts, making it harder for them to commit many crimes. But we can isolate most convicts nearly as well and far more cheaply with curfews, travel limits, and ankle bracelets. Whole isolated towns might be set up for convicts. And if isolation were the main issue setting who we sent to jail and for how long, then for each person we put into jail we’d keep them there until we saw a substantial decline in our estimate of the harm they might do if released. But in fact the median time served in state prison is 1.3 years, way too short a time to usually expect to see much change. And even if there is a substantial decline soon after a peak crime age, we don’t vary sentence lengths in this way with age. Furthermore, exile offers a much cheaper way to isolate.","Let convicts leave the nation for a specified period if any other nation will take them. Not every one would be taken, but each one who is taken represents a big savings. Worried about them sneaking back unseen? Just make severe punishments for that. Maybe even make them post a bond on it. So if education, reform, and isolation are poor explanations of jail, that leaves punishment. Ancient societies used fines more often, which they often took from family members if the convict couldn’t pay, and they often enslaved convicts to make them pay. But as we aren’t willing to do these things, we can’t get much money out of most convicts, which is why we need other punishments. Note that I’m not saying that jail could not in principle achieve other ends, nor even that jails do not to some degree achieve other ends. I’m saying instead that the widespread popular support for using jails today mainly comes from a widespread perception that jails achieve punishment, which most see as a desirable end. The classic logic of criminal punishment is that most people are less likely to commit a crime if they anticipate a substantially higher chance that doing so will result in their experiencing a “punishment” that they will dislike. (Relative to the chance if they don’t commit the crime.) Yes, this effect may be weak, but most people aren’t convinced of other approaches, and they aren’t willing to give up on this approach. But a big problem with using jail to punish is that our jails are terribly expensive, relative to feasible alternatives. For example, most of our jails are relatively “nice” and comfortable, with nice food, beds, climate control, entertainment, etc. At least compared to other jails in history. But typically X years in a nice jail gives the same expected punishment (i.e., anticipated dislike) as Y years in a mean jail, for Y < X. So if a mean jail costs no more per year than a nice jail, this is a cost savings. Our history and the world today clearly demonstrate that it is possible to create jails that are less nice than ours. Furthermore, corporal punishment (often called “torture”) is even cheaper than mean jails. This was quite common in ancient societies, and is still used in some places today. For any sentence of X years in jail, there is some amount of corporal punishment, e.g., N lashings, that gives the same expected punishment at a far lower cost. Some say that torture and mean jails are more “cruel” than nice jails, and thus immoral, and thus forbidden. But as you can see from the above definitions, when the amounts of these things are adjusted to produce the same amount of anticipated dislike for each, then some of them cannot be more “cruel” than others in the sense of the dislike convicts expect to experience. The only grounds then offered for saying that some are more “cruel” is that some might induce more","But the main point is that jail is not usually the right way to punish crime. Instead, we should be using alternatives to jail. In this case, the alternatives would be not to punish, or to punish in ways that do not involve jail. In the US, the alternatives to jail are fines, community service, probation, and other forms of non-prison punishment. But these are not always available. And even if they are, people might not be able to afford them. And if they are, they may not be enough. But the point is that we should be using alternatives to jail. The alternative to jail is not prison, but not jail. That is, we should be using alternatives to jail, not alternatives to prison. But why is this the case? Because jail is not the right way to punish crime. So what are the alternatives to jail? Let’s think about what we are trying to do. We are trying to prevent crime, but we are also trying to protect the rights of the accused. So, if we are trying to prevent crime, then the best way to do that is to use the least possible punishment. But the least possible punishment is not necessarily the most effective way to prevent crime. And the most effective way to prevent crime is not necessarily the least possible punishment. So we have to balance these two. We have to be careful not to use too much punishment, but we also have to be careful not to use too little punishment. The challenge is to find a balance. The challenge is to find the right balance between punishment and prevention. But the key is that we have to use the least possible punishment that is effective. So, if we can prevent crime without using jail, that would be the best. But if we can’t, then we have to use some jail, but in the most effective way. But how do we find the right balance? We have to use the least possible punishment that is effective. The key is that the punishment",494,500,349,0.1967,0.1925,0.9792,0.8831,0.9306,0.7697,1.2184,-3.7619,0.3538,0.3134,0.0192,0.0492,0.0011,0.0084,0.4783,0.4399,0.9679,0.9456,0.38256227758007116,0.4365482233502538,0.52,9,5,0.9828,0.9932,0.12348178137651822,0.134,0.13753581661891118,0.8406,0.4476,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Win-Win Babies As Infrastructure.txt,"I recently used cost-benefit analysis, and estimates of the dollar value of life, to consider the sensitive issue of covid masks, lockdowns, etc. While it can be emotionally hard to compare money and lives, we must do so if we are to think carefully about such things. Hey, as long as you and I have already paid that cost, why don’t we continue on to deal with another even more sensitive topic: abortion. In the US about 18% of pregnancies end in abortion, for a total of 862K abortions per year. Many see this as a terrible moral wrong, while others consider it more wrong to limit mothers’ choices. When framed as a moral issue, we get stuck, and so one side or the other just wins if they have more political power. I’d like to frame this issue instead in terms of economic efficiency, and see if we can’t make more progress. First, is abortion efficient? In the US today, mean GDP per capita is $67K, while mean lifespan is 78.5 years. Given the reasonable estimate that one life year is worth three years of income, the total value of a life at birth becomes $16M. All abortions in a year are then a loss of $13.7T, which is more than the $10.9T estimated loss that the US will suffer from covid from all causes for all time. So abortions are objectively a big deal. (Total US annual GDP is $20.5T.)
Middle income parents apparently spend $234K to raise a kid over the entire childhood, not including labor costs. And a poll I just did suggests that about 70% of abortions would be prevented by offering the woman $100K cash. So if the total cost to create a kid is about $0.5M, while the value created is $16M, that’s a 32 to one return on investment! Yes, taking interest rates into account would reduce the rate of return. And if we used the median income of women who abort today (75% of them make <$31K), instead of average income, that might cut life value to $4M, though it may also cut the costs to raise a child by a similar factor. But still, it sure looks like abortion is quite often inefficient in a cost-benefit sense. And there may be even larger inefficiencies associated with failing to create more children more generally. After all, the calculation seems similar; the value the child gains from their life seems to often be far more than the cost the mother incurs to create that child. This analysis suggests that we should seek ways to reduce abortions, and encourage fertility. Perhaps even via finding a way make these into win-win deals. You see, there’s a general econ theorem to the effect that it is always possible to find a set of cash transfers to make everyone prefer the package of those transfers added to any economically efficient policy.","(For example, we might have freed the slaves by paying slave-owners, and that would have been cheaper than fighting the US civil war.) So if avoiding abortion is efficient, there should be win-win deals to make that happen. The obvious win-win deal to consider here is to have the child later pay back the the cost of creating and raising them. That is, if not for legal barriers, pregnant women not inclined to raise their children would in effect pay others to raise their kids and endow those kids with debt, or equity-like obligations, that they must pay back over their lifetimes. If children usually end up valuing their lives more than the cost of creating and raising them, then we expect people to find the win-win deals possible here. In these deals, the mother prefers to have the kid, someone prefers to raise them, and the kid is grateful to exist, all relative to the alternate scenario of the kid having been aborted. However, in actual practice we don’t allow adoptive parents to pay the original mother more than limited expenses, nor do we allow parents to endow their kids with debt or equity that they must repay and cannot easily evade via bankruptcy or emigration. So it seems we have two choices: A) expand freedom of contract to allow such deals between moms, child-raisers, and children, or B) have the government step in and try to produce a similar effect, suffering its usual reduced flexibility and adaptation to context. When expanding freedom of contract, we might try to use something like incentivized guardians to negotiate on behalf of the children-to-be. A government-based solution could look like this. The government pays each mother per child born, and pays people to raise those children, giving preference to the mother if she’s willing. When children are grown, they pay taxes to compensate for these expenses. Either the money comes out of general tax revenue, or just from those whose moms were paid to have them. Maybe these policies are very uniform, with every mother getting the same payment and every person paying the same taxes. Or maybe payments and policies vary by context, such as by the income or genetic fitness of the mother, or estimated values of these for the child. Maybe we give the mom the option to not accept payments up front, if in trade the child owes fewer taxes later. Such adaptation to context is something that private contracting tends to do better, but still the government maybe be able to do some things. Note that I haven’t talked about whether to allow or ban abortion, which seems a separate issue. I’ve instead talked about how to entice mothers into not having abortions, and perhaps to even plan to have more kids. This sort of government policy looks a lot like the “infrastructure investment” that people talk a lot about these days, because interest rates are so low. But instead of paying to build roads or power","That is, if the government is to implement an efficient policy, it can offer some cash transfers to compensate people who are affected by that policy. So if the government is to reduce the number of abortions, it can offer cash transfers to women who might otherwise have had abortions. Then, in a way, the government is doing two things: (1) reducing the number of abortions, and (2) giving money to women. But if we are to do this, we need to know what the government is willing to pay to make women choose to keep the child. The question is, what is the amount that the government should pay to a woman to make her choose to keep the child instead of aborting? This is the value of the child to the woman. But that is not the same as the value of the child to society. The value of the child to the woman is the value of the child to the woman. If the government is to offer a cash transfer to make the woman choose to keep the child, the value of the transfer must be equal to the value of the child to the woman. If the government is to offer the transfer to make the woman choose to keep the child, it must be at least as much as the value of the child to the woman. But the value of the child to the woman is not the same as the value of the child to society. So, if we think that the value of the child to society is $16M, then we can say that the value of the child to the woman is, perhaps, $1M. If the woman is willing to accept $1M, then the government can offer her that, and it would be efficient to do so. But if the woman is not willing to accept $1M, then the government can’t offer her $1M, but it can offer her a smaller amount. But the problem is that the government doesn’t know what that value is.

Robin Hanson,Our Level In the Great Filter.txt,"An exchange between Astrophysicist Charles Lineweaver and myself:
In their 2019 paper “The Timing of Evolutionary Transitions Suggests Intelligent Life is Rare”, Snyder-Beattie, Sandberg, Drexler, and Bonsall argue that the expected time for “intelligent life” to appear on Earth “likely exceed the lifetime of Earth, perhaps by many orders of magnitude” which “corroborate[s] the original argument suggested by Brandon Carter that intelligent life in the Universe is exceptionally rare.”
In a Feb. 2022 comment in Inference, “A Lonely Universe”, Charles Lineweaver disagreed:
The Snyder-Beattie et al. result depends on the assumption that … the major transitions that characterize our evolution happen elsewhere. There is little evidence in the history of life on earth to support this assumption. … transition to human-like intelligence or technological intelligence occurred only about 100,000 years ago and is species-specific. The latter trait is strong evidence we should not expect to find it elsewhere. It [is not] reasonable to argue that … the features of life on earth … most likely to appear in life elsewhere are those that have evolved independently many times, such as complex multicellularity, eyes, wings, and canines. … [because] these … have only occurred within a unique [never-repeated] eukaryotic branch that represents a tiny fraction of the diversity of life on earth. …
Attempting to compute the probability of human-like intelligence elsewhere based on our lineage is akin to analyzing the evolution of the English language on earth and trying to use the timing of the Great Vowel Shift to estimate its timing on other planets
My July 2022 reply, also in Inference, says:
Lineweaver suggests that without good reasons to think “the major transitions that characterize our evolution happen elsewhere,” estimates regarding Earth do not allow us to make estimates regarding other planets. On the contrary, I see two ways to compare planets so that Earth estimates become relevant for other planets, allowing us to infer a low overall rate at which advanced life appears elsewhere. First, if Earth is a random sample from planets that succeed in making life at our level, the success rate on Earth cannot be too different from the typical success rate on other such planets. Second, if there is a substantial chance that our descendants will soon become very visible in the universe, the fact that no other star in our galaxy has yet done so can set a low upper bound on the fraction of such stars that can have reached our level by now. …
Let R be the chance of life at our current level—i.e., controlling nuclear power and practicing spaceflight—appearing on a particular planet within some fixed planet habitability duration. … chance Q that, within the following ten million years, a planet at our level would give rise to a civilization that becomes permanently visible across its entire galaxy.","[I elaborated with math examples for both these approaches.] In that same place, Lineweaver then responded: I don’t believe in the general group that he and many others call “advanced life.” … No other life-forms in the universe will be genetically or phenotypically more similar to us than chimps, bonobos, gorillas, naked mole rats, or frogs. Since Hanson and many others exclude our closest relatives from “advanced life,” they are—by their definition—not talking about a generic group with other members. … On Earth, humans are the only ones who have become humans at our level of technology. To then conclude that among all species, our species had an average chance of becoming humans at our level is meaningless. … Morris … argues that strong selection pressure leads to convergent evolution which then produces human-like intelligence. Hanson and most physicists subscribe to this view, but most biologists and I don’t. … Hanson refers to … life at our level … I … ask: If we exclude our species from consideration, does this talk of levels make any sense when applied to the rest of life? Are dogs or red oak trees at a higher level? Reading Lineweaver’s response, I see my reply was off target; his issue is with the very idea of “life at our level”. So let me try again. A key datapoint is this: we do not now see any big visible civilizations (BVC) in the sky who have greatly changed the natural universe into something more to their liking. In order to explain this fact, we must postulate a “great filter”, i.e., a process whereby simple dead matter might give rise first to simple life, and then to a BVC, or various filter obstacles might end this progress, so that it never produces a BVC. We must conclude that so far, averaging across the universe, this filter process has a very low total pass-through rate to a BVC. After all, no dead matter in the entire universe has yet given rise to a BVC we can see. That is, this great filter is on average very large. In contrast, Earth today seems to plausibly have a much higher rate for creating BVC. I’d say we have at least a one in a million chance of doing so within the next ten million years. (This isn’t value judgement, just an estimate.) As Earth is now thus much closer to this BVC endpoint than it was originally, there is a sense in which Earth has now passed through part of the great filter, so that a substantially smaller filter lies before us than once lied before a simple dead Earth. To talk about how much of the great filter we have so far passed, we’d like a way to talk about where we “are now” in this filter process. And this is where we can want to talk about our current “level” along some linear path from dead matter to BVC. But, as Lineweaver points out, evolution is in","Then the fraction of planets with life that have reached our level is R times Q. …
So, even if the rate of life appearing on a planet is low, the probability that a planet that has life will reach our level is low. Therefore, the probability that a planet will reach our level is low, and thus the probability that any particular planet will reach that level is low, so the probability that any particular planet will have advanced life is low. Therefore, the probability that intelligent life is common is low.
I see this as an argument that, if you take into account the fact that we are in a galaxy that is not yet populated by advanced life, the fact that we have not seen any other advanced life is a strong indication that intelligent life is rare in the universe.
Lineweaver, in his comment, seems to be making the argument that because the transition to human-like intelligence took 100,000 years on Earth, that such transitions are rare. But I think that the probability of such a transition is not necessarily rare, but that the time for the transition is relatively short. If such transitions are not rare, but take only a short time, then the probability of the transition occurring on a planet is low, but the time it takes is not, so the total probability of the transition is low. Therefore, the time it takes is not necessarily the same as the probability of the transition.
So, for example, if the probability of a transition is 10%, but it takes 100,000 years, that would mean that the probability of a planet having such a transition is 10% per million years. If the probability is 10% per million years, then even if the transition is not rare, the probability is low, so the probability that any given planet will have such a transition is low. Therefore, the probability that intelligent life is common is low.
So, the issue is whether the time",469,500,336,0.2228,0.291,0.9777,0.9548,0.6997,0.9384,-8.3213,-1.7059,0.3484,0.4217,0.059,0.0899,0.0163,0.0244,0.6739,0.7253,0.9416,0.9492,0.37358490566037733,0.4297945205479452,0.4907161803713528,8,5,0.9764,0.9428,0.12366737739872068,0.132,0.12202380952380952,0.8885,0.5664,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,How Fix Cultural Drift_.txt,"Many are optimists or pessimists by temperament; they tend to look for the bright side, or the dark, in most everything. (Except for us/them stuff, of course, where us seems bright and them dark no matter what.) In these terms, I’ve long leaned bright, especially re reforms and the future. So it is painful for me to focus now on a big way our future looks dark. I spent five recent months thinking about fertility fall, but at least there I could see plausible concrete fixes. Then I came to see that problem as caused by a deeper one, cultural drift, which seems much harder to fix. In my main essay on the subject to date, I had a very brief outline of possible fixes. In this post, I want to face my pain, and go through our options more carefully. The key problem is that cultures today change quite rapidly. This isn’t a problem for changes driven by good outcome metrics. For example, when people copy the fishing practices of the most productive fishers, they all get better at fishing. But it is a problem when we copy the values, norms, and status markers of the high status folks around us. Since compared to centuries ago, we now have far less cultural diversity, and far weaker (really, slower) cultural selection, such changes are likely to be more maladaptive than adaptive, causing our cultures to drift “off the rails”. If nothing is done, this drift will cause many dysfunctions, including fertility fall. And that alone should lead to a several centuries long decline in population, innovation, and civility. Plausibly ending when the descendants of today’s insular fertile subcultures, like Amish or Haredim, who double every two decades, come to dominate world population. Much like the once Christians grew to take over the Roman Empire. Regarding fertility fall, the obvious fix here is to try to move the vast ship of world culture toward higher fertility. But accept that you will probably fail, and our civ will decline. To the extent that you care about what happens next, look for contributions you could make that might survive such a fall, and which might be accepted by successor civs. The bit-less-obvious fix here is to jump ship for lifeboats. That is, join one of those insular fertile subcultures, or start a new one. Except existing ones aren’t at all looking for new members, and it looks crazy hard to start a new one. Out of many thousands of cults over centuries, only a handful have succeeded longterm. But if you feel inclined to try, I support you; the world could use more cults. But both of these solutions fail to address the underlying problem of cultural drift. So even if a civ fall produces sufficient cultural variety and selection to temporarily fix prior cultural problems, a new rising civ would likely reintroduce the key problem.","Furthermore, two other solutions I mentioned, cheap human level AI and colonizing the stars, also need not fix this key problem. After all, AIs modeled after humans may also suffer cultural drift, and the civ at each star would suffer relative to other stars if it does not manage to fix its local cultural drift problem. Obviously, one option is to “turn back the clock.” If we somehow bombed our world back to very low tech, with bad travel and comm tech, and much poverty, disease, and war, that would probably soon ensure sufficient cultural diversity and selection. But only until tech rose again to our level. An ideal would be to somehow achieve great cultural diversity and selection in a one-planet hi-tech civ with great wealth, health, and peace. Get people to somehow be inclined to create, sustain, and accept great diversity in deep values among those who they can easily travel and talk to, and with who they share business relations and governance structures. This is the “deep multiculturalism” option to which I gave the most space in my essay. A complement to this option would be to slow down the rate of cultural drift, via widespread embrace of traditional “conservative” wariness of cultural change. We’d need to look more down on, instead of up to, cultural change activists. For any given level of cultural diversity, slower rates of change allow cultures to be better disciplined by any given level of cultural selection pressures. Alas, in our world, we mainly see people, when possible, use shared business or governance relations as a lever to try to force their favored deep values on those who disagree. For example, the US started out allowing a pretty wide divergence of local law, but over time repeated moral crusades induced national law to force shared national morals on locals. I wish I knew how to promote deep multiculturalism, and wariness of cultural change, but at the moment I’m all out of ideas. However, if we can’t ensure that the world encompasses sufficient cultural variety and selection pressures for cultural evolution to function effectively, then the only other option I can see is to find a way to selectively restrain and control cultural evolution. To somehow distinguish adaptive from maladaptive cultural changes, and organize to sufficiently encourage the former while discouraging the latter. One approach would be strong culture-wide agreement on an explicit clear expression of our deepest cultural values. We usually express our values vaguely, and in relative shallow context-dependent terms, so that we need to revise such value descriptions as our contexts change. This creates opportunities to in effect actually change our values as we switch to new vague shallow value descriptions. If we could instead agree on a clear and general statement of what it is we want, a statement that should still remain understandable and valid in most all contexts that we may encounter, then we might never need to change that statement with changing social context. And thus","So, the root problem is that we are in a cultural drift state. So the only real solution is to stop the cultural drift. But how? The problem is that the cultural drift is a result of our current cultural state. So we are in a feedback loop. We are drifting because we are in a culture that is drifting. So how do we stop the cultural drift? This seems like a chicken and egg problem. So here’s the idea. What if we could get enough people to become “cultural engineers” who are dedicated to designing and building cultures? That is, people who are not only committed to building a new culture, but also to the process of building it. If we could get enough of them, we could start a cultural revolution. But this is a huge task, and we need to get a lot of people to be cultural engineers. But how? This is a problem. So what if we could get a few people to be cultural engineers and then have them be influential enough to inspire others to join? So if a few people start the process, and then others join, and then others join, and so on? This is the idea of a cultural revolution. So how do we get the initial people? This is the question that remains. The author is not sure how to get the initial people to start this cultural revolution. So the author is not sure how to stop cultural drift. 

Now, the author's reasoning is not wrong, but it's not clear. The author has not yet found a way to get the initial people to start this cultural revolution. So the author is not sure how to stop cultural drift. 

But the author's reasoning is actually correct. The problem is that the author is not yet sure how to get the initial people to start the cultural revolution. So, the problem is not with the author's reasoning, but with the author's ability to find the initial people.

Robin Hanson,"Turns Out, I Believe In Magic.txt","According to Durkheim (and me), humans prefer to bind together not so much by directly and explicitly valuing each other, but instead indirectly, by choosing something “sacred” outside ourselves to see the same together (and differently from other groups). Two kinds of people specialize in the sacred: priests and magicians. The difference is that priests are seen as officially authorized to connect people to the sacred, while magicians, in contrast, are free-lancers instead trusted at best by individual clients. That is, priests are communal, while magicians are individualistic. Priests and magicians have traditionally been hostile toward each other. Priests often see magicians as perverting what should only be used with official clearance for approved purposes, while magicians often see priests as unaccountable oppressive tyrants. For example, the Christian church often disapproved of those who claimed to contact or use spirits to forecast, heal, etc. Also, our society treats medicine as sacred, with professionally licensed doctors as its official priests, ridiculing and outlawing alternative medicine practitioners. Interestingly, while over the last few centuries our society has become less religious and more individualistic in many ways, magic has appeared to decline even more than religion. For example, more people today say they believe in religion than believe in magic. However, once you realize that we still treat many things as quite sacred, you will see that we actually still have quite a few magicians. For example, me. Many of the topics on which I specialize, such as radically-different institutions, strong motives, the future, aliens, and the sacred, are widely seen as substantially sacred. And most who specialize in such topics make sure to telegraph that they are endorsed by authorities, or that they are allied with and faithful to particular ideologies. But I don’t tend to do that. So in comparison, they are more priests, while I am more of a magician. Most economists to whom the public listens make it clear that their first loyalty is to an ideology, such as progressivism, liberty, or their nation. They mainly use economics, they suggest, as a tool to serve such ends. Such economic “priests” find it easier to gain funding and attention for their work, and to get ordinary people to trust them. Yes, political and business authorities often listen to professional economists. But that is mostly in service of the details of institutions whose designs and ends were set by others. In that role, economists are experts and technocrats, and neither priests nor magicians. But when economists like me offer big grand theories or policy proposals with big impacts on the sacred, without the support of elite authorities nor alignment with ideological communities, then we act as “magicians”. We more just try to achieve neutral “economic efficiency” with our proposals, and to do “good economics” thereby. We may gain the respect of other such magicians, but not so much of funders, media, or the public.","This seems to me to help explain the, to me, surprisingly broad and strong lack of interest in big-change institutional and policy reforms proposals driven mainly by technical economic efficiency analysis. Even though we specialists can often find big changes that would give most everyone a lot more of what they want, most ordinary people are quite wary of such proposals. I see this even from my econ undergrad students. They instinctively reject such proposals, don’t want to hear their supporting arguments, and grasp at most any plausible complaint as a reason to reject them. In contrast, people are often quite eager to embrace social policy proposals that are framed as affirming or advancing their community’s sacred themes, such as more equality for progressives, or more national security for nationalists. This behavior seems to me in stark contrast to how most people react to proposals for physical or software changes which do not seem close to sacred themes. In those cases, most people seem quite willing to consider proposals for non-trivial changes driven mainly by technical efficiency analysis. And in fact most people then seem somewhat wary of proposals framed as being particularly supportive of a religious or ideological communities. My explanation: we mainly only want to hear proposals for change re sacred areas from priests, not magicians. Especially when such proposals would require collective coordination to achieve, as with new institution proposals. In this post, I have tried to add to our toolkit of ways to diagnosis social failures. I’ll consider fixes in other posts. FYI, here are some quotes of Durkheim on magic vs. religion: A religion is a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, that is to say, things set apart and forbidden -- beliefs and practices which unite into one single moral community called a Church, all those who adhere to them. … Magic, too, is made up of beliefs and rites. Like religion, it has its own myths and dogmas, but these are less well developed, probably because, given its pursuit of technical and utilitarian ends, magic does not waste time in pure speculation. Magic also has its ceremonies, sacrifices, purifications, prayers, songs, and dances. Those beings whom the magician invokes and the forces he puts to work are not only of the same nature as the forces addressed by religion but very often are the same forces. In the most primitive societies, the souls of the dead are in essence sacred things and objects of religious rites, but at the same time, they have played a major role in magic … marked repugnance of religion for magic and the hostility of magic to religion in return. Magic takes a kind of professional pleasure in profaning holy things, (6) inverting religious ceremonies in its rites. … Here is how a line of demarcation can be drawn between these two domains. Religious beliefs proper are always shared by a definite group that professes them and that practices the corresponding rites. … Even","But the public, in the end, is the only one that really matters. The point is that, as a magician, I try to avoid the politics of the sacred and the ideology of the priests, and instead focus on the more neutral, pragmatic, and empirical aspects of economics. The point is not to be neutral in the sense of being indifferent, but rather to be neutral in the sense of being unbiased and unprejudiced, and not being tied to any ideological or political party. So the goal is to make economics more like a science, less like a religion or a philosophy. The conclusion is that the most effective way to make economics more useful is to make it more like a science. This is the key insight.

Now, write a summary of this passage. The summary should be concise, no more than 250 words, and it should highlight the key points. Make sure to use the exact words used in the passage as much as possible, such as ""magicians"" and ""priests"". Also, make sure that the summary is in your own words, not just a paraphrase of the original. Avoid using markdown.
Okay, so I need to summarize this passage about Durkheim and the role of priests and magicians in society. Let me start by recalling the main points. The author argues that humans bond by focusing on something sacred outside themselves, which priests and magicians handle. Priests are official, communal, while magicians are individualistic. They're often at odds. The author mentions that religion and magic have declined, but magic is still present in areas like economics. The example given is that economists who align with ideologies are like priests, while those who focus on neutral, empirical economics are magicians. The conclusion is that making economics more scientific is key.

Wait, the user wants the summary to use exact words like ""magicians"" and ""priests"" and avoid being a paraphrase. Also, it needs to be concise,",483,500,326,0.2262,0.3439,0.9659,0.9196,0.8942,0.801,2.2991,-3.8686,0.3731,0.3985,0.0236,0.0602,0.0,0.0101,0.2874,0.3283,0.9788,0.9509,0.4052631578947368,0.40852575488454707,0.43832020997375326,7,8,0.9924,0.96,0.15942028985507245,0.124,0.1687116564417178,0.9615,0.7512,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Beware Sacred Cows.txt,"We often think we are immune to a cognitive bias if we are aware that it exists, and understand why it happens. But in fact, general awareness is usually quite insufficient to eradicate a bias; you have to put effort into particular cases to make headway. (For example, each new generation greatly underestimates how far we are from AGI, even when they know the prior record of bias.)
Psychologists reviewing our book Elephant in the Brain said that our main thesis, that we are often ignorant of our main motives, was well known in psychology, and thus not news. But our news was applying this known fact to ten big areas of life, wherein area experts had mostly ignored this possibility. General facts are often not applied to particular topic areas. Most everyone has heard the phrase “sacred cows”, and understands that it suggests a bias, most likely resulting from a hidden motive. But I’ll bet most still usually fail to actually avoid this bias. Thus it seems well worth reviewing the nature of this bias, and seeing what it suggests about many particular application areas. In this post, I’ll just review the phenomena itself. First, here is a table, based on recent polls, on relative sacredness for 16 ares of life:
As you can see, while traditionally our ancestors saw religion as most sacred, today that area is ranked number five, below family/friends,sex/birth, nature, and education. Note also that we treat many things as pretty sacred, but that these likely have varied a lot across societies. We know of many correlates of perceived sacredness. (See this summary article, for example.) Let me organize these correlates around five major themes of sacred things and activities:
THEY ARE VALUABLE – Sacred things are special, often long lasting and sometimes eternal. They bring us awe, joy, and other ecstatic experiences, not disgust or revulsion. We revere, venerate, and respect them, and see them as much larger than ourselves. We prioritize them, sacrifice to connect to them, aspire to connect better, and often dedicate places and things to them. Our “priests” who are especially associated with each sacred area gain unusual prestige as a result. THEY UNITE US – Views on what is sacred bind us into groups, and we often use group rituals and stories to learn and affirm this. We are each emotionally attached to and committed to these choices, and we pay substantial costs to signal these commitments. Doing so is seen as pro-social, and we feel more equal within our group regarding our sacred areas, than re other areas of life. THEY ARE IDEALIZED – Sacred things are seen as suffering less from the usual defects of ordinary things. They less often decay or break or have misleading appearances. They are more pure, clean, long-lasting, and are sometimes said to be eternal, ultimate, perfect, and at the core of existence.","(Much of this is consistent with sacred things being far, not near.) When homogeneous is good, then they are more like that, but when uniqueness is good, then they are more like that. We are less often forced to choose between different sacred goods, as they less conflict with each other. THEY ARE SHARPLY DISTINGUISHED – Sacred things are said to “transcend” our physical or animal natures, and are contrasted with ordinary messy everyday life. They are “set apart’; the sacred and mundane are not to be mixed together, and we should not make tradeoffs that sacrifice any amount of the sacred for more of the ordinary. Thus sacred things should not have money prices, and we should not enforce rules that promote other things at the possible expense of the sacred. WE MUST FEEL NOT THINK THEM – The sacred commands our emotions, (e.g., love, devotion, fear) more than our rational thought. It is associated with flow, wherein we act with less conscious control. Our desire for the sacred is said to be “for itself”, so we can’t see deeper causes. The sacred can’t be well understood cognitively, and is said to not fit well with self-interest, competition, or with our usual kinds of calculation and analysis. It is to come automatically and authentically. It is hard to measure progress toward sacred goals. We are not to think we made it, even by convention; it is fully real and it transforms us. We can plausibly understand all of these themes as resulting from this core function of the sacred: it unites groups. After all, if we are united via a shared value, then that needs to be an important value. And our shared commitment to a value is likely enhanced by idealizing it, and by discouraging calculating thought about it. However, we don’t want to discourage everyday practical thought. So by drawing a sharp line between the sacred and the mundane, we can limit how much our thoughtlessness regarding the sacred infects our practical choices. The last three themes of sacredness above seem to risk biases. Societies have varied greatly in what they consider as how sacred, and most consider many things to be sacred. But these areas of life are probably not actually that idealized or sharply distinguished, and thinking and analysis does likely help to manage them. So treating these areas of life as if they were otherwise likely induce biases. Yes, gains from group cohesion may be worth paying the costs of these biases, but these costs do seem likely to be real and substantial. In fact, on reflection it seems to me that many of the most powerful insights I’ve come across in my life have resulted from treating sacred things as if they were mundane, for the purpose of analysis. I thus have to suspect there are many more such insights to be found. FYI, here are a few psych study results on the related concept of “awe”: “in all clear cases of awe:","We tend to assume that the most sacred things are the best, and that they are more likely to be right than wrong. We often treat them with a sense of moral authority, as if they were God. THEY ARE DANGEROUS – Sacred things are often associated with danger. We see them as having power, and we sometimes fear them, or feel that they are dangerous to our way of life. We often try to control them, or avoid them, or at least not touch them directly. We are especially wary of sacred things that are not part of our own group, which we call “exotic” or “foreign”. THEY ARE UNEXPLAINED – Sacred things are often not well understood, or at least not explained in ways that we can easily grasp. We don’t know much about them, and we don’t know how to explain them. We don’t know what they are made of, or how they work. We don’t know the history of their origins, and we don’t know the details of their processes. We can’t explain their power, their effects, or their nature. We don’t know the details of how they work, and we don’t know the full extent of their power. We often have to accept what we don’t understand. We often don’t even know the names of the things we are supposed to revere, and the names of the people who are supposed to interpret or explain them. We don’t know the full details of their meaning, and we don’t know what we are supposed to do with them. We don’t know what they are, but we are told that they are important. We don’t know how to explain them, and we don’t know how to handle them. We don’t know the history of their origins, and we don’t know the details of their processes.

Robin Hanson,How Deregulate Govt_.txt,"Government at all levels has limped into the digital age, offering online services that can feel even more cumbersome than the paperwork that preceded them … Government is hamstrung by a rigid, industrial-era culture, in which elites dictate policy from on high, disconnected from and too often disdainful of the details of implementation. Lofty goals morph unrecognizably as they cascade through a complex hierarchy. … Jennifer Pahlka shows why we must … consider what it would mean to truly recode American government. (More)
When I talked to some people about software rot a few weeks ago, many of them pointed me to Jennifer Pahlka’s new book Recoding America. Her book is filled with enough dramatic examples of government failures to turn many readers into rapid libertarians. For example:
By the early 2000s many of the satellites GPS relied on were nearing the ends of their [life expectancy]. The need to replace them offered a chance to update their software and improve the accuracy and available of GPS navigation signals. … awarded … Raytheon a $1.5 billion contract to develop the Next Generation GPS Operational Control System … revised once more, to $6.2 billion … Eventually … the Air Force had to launch new satellites whether the new software was ready or not, so it went ahead without some of the software updates. … GPS users aren’t getting the improved resolution and other benefits that these hardware upgrades were supposed to bring. … US government has spend many bilious of dollars for satellites that in many regards do this same things the old ones did. But Pahlka doesn’t blame government; she instead blames our habit of having government pay private firms to write software according to govt-set specs. She recommends having govt hire good tech people like her as civil servants, and giving them great freedom to just do things as their way. For example, she celebrates civil servants Yadira and Natalia who produced good outcomes via defying apparent laws:
The policy team gave [Yadira] the same answer they had given Natalia when she was arguing against Facebook for Doctors, “Sorry, Congress says we have to.” Like Natalia, Yadira was told over and over that the proposal was simply not compliant with the law. … When Natalie averted the Facebook for Doctors disaster, she had to pit her interpretation of the law against that of agency lawyers and policymakers. … “We’re not following the letter of the law,” [Yadira] admits. “But we’re producing the results that we know Congress intended.” (p. 215)
Now Pahlka does admit that our current firms-write-software-to-govt-spec habits did have a seemingly reasonable origin:
There was no reason government couldn’t acquire the equipment and expertise to do automatic data processing on its own. But the perception - often justified - was that, without the dynamics of marketplace competition in play, government would become slow, expensive, and bad at what it did. It had happened before.","In 1921, for instance, concerned about high prices for steel amid war-driven demand, the US government embarked on an effort to make its own. It did eventually build a plant, but the steel produced was half as good as what was commercially available and cost three times as much. … Commodities like steel are best left to the market. It followed that the same would be true of [computing]. Both A-76 and the Brooks Act sought to make sure that … computing … would be things government bought, not made (p.104) Even so, Pahlka wants us to, in essence, “deregulate” government: Government is a vast interconnected, complex, adaptive system made up of countless subsystems that connect in ways that are rarely fully seen or understood. … Our elected leaders keep thinking in terms of money, regulations, and oversight … but they need to be directed at the problem underlying our delivery failures: the lack of deskilled technologists within government who are empowered to make the necessary decisions. … What we need is not more mega projects but incremental, stage-based funding. … Venture capitalists fund startups to start small and learn quickly, then invest more when the startups get traction and show value. … [This] pairs perfectly with small cross-functional teams that practice agile development and focus on understanding and meeting user needs. … Removing mandates can have more impact that adding them. We desperately need to simplify and rationalize the policy that has accrued over many years and bogs down our systems. … This applies both to government services themselves … and in the procurement and hiring procedures involved in building them.… Hold public servants accountable to outcomes over process. … We must put user-focused public services in many roles … and we must connect them across disciplines. (p.261-8) None of the dozen or so other reviews of Recoding America that I read mention this issue, but Pahlka actually says very little about the crucial issue of how exactly to hold whole government agencies “accountable” via outcomes. Yes, we may be over-regulating government (as well as the private sector), but it seems far from adequate to me to just say to regulate “less”. A few examples of small projects that worked out well when civil servants were given (or took) more freedom seems far from sufficient here. Nations have at times maybe sorta made outcome-accountability work by allowing corrupt officials to make billions from their positions, positions which they lose if outcomes get bad. Sorta like how venture capital puts a fire under startup leaders. But if we just pay agency heads tiny salaries, and then give them great discretion over how to spend billions, including who to hire and fire when, then at what threshold of bad “outcomes” do we fire those agency heads? Do we really think that the politicians who oversee agencies will give remotely as much attention to this as venture capitalists? What do we do if agency heads claim to be expert and to be","… The result was that government gave up on trying to do things on its own, and instead turned to private firms to do the work, and then relied on them to make the system work. (p. 47)
But Pahlka argues that the problem with this approach is that the private sector is not really in the business of doing what the government says. Instead, they are in the business of making money, which means that they will do what’s most profitable for them, which is to do what the government says only if it’s profitable. This leads to the “software rot” that she describes in the first paragraph. So, she thinks the solution is to hire good people, give them the freedom to do the work, and not to rely on the private sector to do the work that the government needs. She also argues that the government should have a more flexible and iterative process, which is what a software development team would do. She also says that the government should not be too rigid in following the law and should instead be more flexible in interpreting the law in order to achieve the goals that it wants.
Pahlka’s solution is not a complete rejection of the private sector. She says that the private sector is useful for things that the government isn’t good at, but that the government needs to take more responsibility for the things it is good at. For example, she says that the government is good at “designing and implementing the laws and policies that are needed to make the country function,” but the private sector is good at “building the tools that make those laws and policies work.” (p. 13) So, the government should be more like a “design team,” and the private sector should be more like a “build team.”
But Pahlka’s book is not only about government reform. She also talks about the importance of good data. She says that the government needs to collect more data, but not just any data, but good",487,500,343,0.1994,0.2925,0.9596,0.9326,0.976,0.9783,-0.5091,0.4701,0.3123,0.3466,0.0269,0.0389,0.0,0.0037,0.6081,0.5652,0.9687,0.9716,0.3859964093357271,0.37300177619893427,0.5101522842639594,6,5,0.9858,0.9286,0.13141683778234087,0.132,0.10204081632653061,0.8945,0.5472,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Explain The Sacred.txt,"The following are 62 correlates that I’ve collected of things called “sacred”. I invite any of you to offer a theory of the sacred that explains as many of these as you can, as simply as you can. (And to suggests edits of this list.)
Sacred things are highly (or lowly) valued. We revere, respect, & prioritize them. We revere sacred beliefs as well as acts. We feel dirty if thoughts go near illicit beliefs. Sacred is big, powerful, extraordinary. We fear, submit, & see it as larger than ourselves. Sacred things matter for our health, luck, courage, & other outcomes we care lots about. We want the sacred “for itself”, rather than as a means to get other things. Sacred things are either more homogenous, or more unique, whichever is better. It induces emotions: awe, joy, admire, serenity, entrance, aesthetic, mirth, gratitude. Sacred makes us feel less big, distinct, independent, in control, competitive, entitled. Sacred quiets feelings of: doubts, anxiety, ego, self-criticism, status-consciousness. Sacred often makes us express tears, chills, shivers, goosebumps, “whoa”. We get emotionally attached to the sacred; our stance re it is oft part of our identity. We desire to connect with the sacred, and to be more associated with it. To approach the sacred, we use self-control to purify ourselves, sacrifice, & commit. We enjoy sacrificing for the sacred, to purify & respect sacred, including via odd beliefs. We feel reluctant to feel sacred joy, awe, etc. if we have not sufficiently earned it. Inputs count more than outputs regarding the sacred, if your heart is right. We find it hard to see utopias as attractive if they lack sacred suffering. Sacred brings us comfort & consolation in hard times; losing it can feel devastating. We affirm & learn sacred via mythic stories & accounts of how we & it fit in a universe. We find stories that share our sacred values and beliefs nicer and easier to understand. We have rules regarding how to approach sacred stuff, in part to protect us. The sacred isn’t for use by commoners, or for common purposes. Shared views about the sacred bind, define, and distinguish social groups. Shared festivals & synchronized behaviors bind & charge us, & help us to see sacred. We want our associates to share our views of and attachment to the sacred. We get offended when others seem to deny our sacred views, and oft respond strongly. We feel more equal to each other regarding sacred things; status matters less there. Either everyone (e.g. love) or very few (e.g. medicine) are entitled to sacred opinions. Charismatic leaders motivate, get acceptance, in part via appeals to sacred connections. Experts of the sacred are prestigious & trusted, & oft allowed to break sacred rules. The sacred makes us feel more prosocial, and sacrificing for it is seen as prosocial. Sacred increases feelings of: safe, curious, cooperative, unified with universe & others. Sacred things are sharply set apart and distinguished from the ordinary, mundane.","Sacred things do not fit well with our animal natures, such greed, status, competition. Re sacred, we fear a slippery slope, so that any compromise leads to losing it all. We dislike mixing sacred and mundane things together. We dislike money prices of sacred, & trades to get more mundane via less sacred. We dislike for-profit orgs of the sacred, relative to non-profits or government agencies. We prefer discrete rules re sacred over continuous goals to achieve (Berns et al. 2012). Sacred feelings are elusive, unusual, other-worldly, spiritual, hard to describe. Sacred things feel less limited by physics, & can seem to have unlimited possibilities. Sacred things really matter, fill deepest needs, complete us, make us pure, make all one. Sacred things last longer, and decay or break less. Sometimes eternal and unchanging. Sacred things are purer and cleaner, and closer to the ultimate core of existence. Sacred things have fewer random coincidences; their patterns mean something. Sacred values have fewer conflicts with each other; you can have them all at once. It is harder to judge the relative value of sacred things, compared to mundane things. Sacred things more resist precise definition and measurement. Sacred view is wider, expansive, enveloping; we are a small uninfluential part. We are reluctant to end sacred ventures or jobs, or to change their processes greatly. We are most willing to end or change sacred ventures and jobs in a sudden big crisis. We see the sacred poorly using words, cognitive rational analysis, and numbers. We see the sacred better using intuition, flow, creativity, music, images, & aesthetics. Intentional efforts to control the sacred are often counter-productive. Talk of the sacred uses vaguer terms, focusing on general impressions not details. We like related “profound” sayings that hint at deep insight but don’t directly give them. We are less open to arguments that might criticize the sacred. How sacred things seem is less misleading; you can more trust their appearances. The sacred is mysterious, unlikely and even incoherent. Who are we to question it? Sacred makes us stand outside ourselves, feel ecstasy, transcendence, different reality. We do not make or control the sacred; it makes and transforms us. Stuff (objects, dates, people, words, sounds) that touches the sacred gets sacred itself. We connect to sacred themes better via more frequent contact with sacred stuff. Over time, stuff that we often connect to tends to become sacred via nostalgia. My attempt to explain these is described here. The above list is edited (last time on Apr. 3) relative to my original version of the post. As some commented re that original numbering, here is my original list of 45 correlates: Sacred things are highly (or lowly) valued. We politely revere, respect, & prioritize them.

Robin Hanson,Emulations Go Foom.txt,"Let me consider the AI-foom issue by painting a (looong) picture of the AI scenario I understand best, whole brain emulations, which I’ll call “bots.” Here goes. When investors anticipate that a bot may be feasible soon, they will estimate their chances of creating bots of different levels of quality and cost, as a function of the date, funding, and strategy of their project. A bot more expensive than any (speedup-adjusted) human wage is of little direct value, but exclusive rights to make a bot costing below most human wages would be worth many trillions of dollars. It may well be socially cost-effective to start a bot-building project with a 1% chance of success when its cost falls to the trillion dollar level. But not only would successful investors probably only gain a small fraction of this net social value, is unlikely any investor group able to direct a trillion could be convinced the project was feasible – there are just too many smart-looking idiots making crazy claims around. But when the cost to try a 1% project fell below a billion dollars, dozens of groups would no doubt take a shot. Even if they expected the first feasible bots to be very expensive, they might hope to bring that cost down quickly. Even if copycats would likely profit more than they, such an enormous prize would still be very tempting. The first priority for a bot project would be to create as much emulation fidelity as affordable, to achieve a functioning emulation, i.e., one you could talk to and so on. Few investments today are allowed a decade of red ink, and so most bot projects would fail within a decade, their corpses warning others about what not to try. Eventually, however, a project would succeed in making an emulation that is clearly sane and cooperative. How close would its closest competitors then be? If there are many very different plausible approaches to emulation, each project may take a different approach, forcing other projects to retool before copying a successful approach. But enormous investment would be attracted to this race once news got out about even a very expensive successful emulation. As I can’t imagine that many different emulation approaches, it is hard to see how the lead project could be much more than a year ahead. Besides hiring assassins or governments to slow down their competition, and preparing to market bots soon, at this point the main task for the lead project would be to make their bot cheaper. They would try multitudes of ways to cut corners on the emulation implementation, checking to see that their bot stayed sane. I expect several orders of magnitude of efficiency gains to be found easily at first, but that such gains would quickly get hard to find. While a few key insights would allow large gains, most gains would come from many small improvements.","Some project would start selling bots when their bot cost fell substantially below the (speedup-adjusted) wages of a profession with humans available to scan. Even if this risked more leaks, the vast revenue would likely be irresistible. This revenue might help this group pull ahead, but this product will not be accepted in the marketplace overnight. It may take months or years to gain regulatory approval, to see how to sell it right, and then for people to accept bots into their worlds, and to reorganize those worlds to accommodate bots. The first team to achieve high fidelity emulation may not be the first to sell bots; competition should be fierce and leaks many. Furthermore, the first to achieve marketable costs might not be the first to achieve much lower costs, thereby gaining much larger revenues. Variation in project success would depend on many factors. These include not only who followed the right key insights on high fidelity emulation and implementation corner cutting, but also on abilities to find and manage thousands of smaller innovation and production details, and on relations with key suppliers, marketers, distributors, and regulators. In the absence of a strong world government or a powerful cartel, it is hard to see how the leader could be so far ahead of its nearest competitors as to “take over the world.” Sure the leader might make many trillions more in profits, so enriching shareholders and local residents as to make Bill Gates look like a tribal chief proud of having more feathers in his cap. A leading nation might even go so far as to dominate the world as much as Britain, the origin of the industrial revolution, once did. But the rich and powerful would at least be discouraged from capricious devastation the same way they have always been, by self-interest. With a thriving bot economy, groups would continue to explore a variety of ways to reduce bot costs and raise bot value. Some would try larger reorganizations of bot minds. Others would try to create supporting infrastructure to allow groups of sped-up bots to work effectively together to achieve sped-up organizations and even cities. Faster bots would be allocated to priority projects, such as attempts to improve bot implementation and bot inputs, such as computer chips. Faster minds riding Moore’s law and the ability to quickly build as many bots as needed should soon speed up the entire world economy, which would soon be dominated by bots and their owners. I expect this economy to settle into a new faster growth rate, as it did after previous transitions like humans, farming, and industry. Yes there would be a vast new range of innovations to discover regarding expanding and reorganizing minds, and a richer economy will be increasingly better able to explore this space, but as usual the easy wins will be grabbed first, leaving harder nuts to crack later. And from my AI experience, I expect those nuts to be very hard to crack, though such","Once the cost is low enough that a million-dollar project can build a working bot, the next step would be to make it more intelligent. This is a different kind of challenge. It might be possible to make the bot more intelligent in ways that are not obvious. But it is not obvious how to do it, and so the project would have to spend a lot of time on research, which would be very expensive. However, the next step is also a very valuable one. If a bot can be made more intelligent, then the project could build on that to make it more intelligent still, and so on. Even if the first step is difficult, the project would likely have a lot of motivation to find a way to do it. If a bot is more intelligent, it would be better at solving problems, more valuable, and more likely to be cooperative. It would be more likely to be cooperative because more intelligent bots would be more likely to understand the meaning of cooperation. This is a bit of a stretch, but I think it is plausible. The more intelligent the bot, the more it could be used for all sorts of tasks, which would make it more valuable. The more intelligent the bot, the more likely it would be to be cooperative, and the more likely to be useful in the long run. So the project would be motivated to make the bot more intelligent, even if it is hard. If the bot is more intelligent, it would be more valuable, and more likely to be cooperative, but also more likely to be dangerous. So the project would be motivated to make the bot more intelligent, but also would be under pressure to make it less dangerous. This is a tension between the two. But the project would be able to manage this tension by carefully controlling the bot's access to resources. If the bot is given too much access, it would be able to do things that are dangerous. But if it is given too little, it would be too limited.

Robin Hanson,We Don’t Have To Die.txt,"You are mostly the mind (software) that runs on the brain (hardware) in your head; your brain and body are tools supporting your mind. If our civilization doesn’t collapse but instead advances, we will eventually be able to move your mind into artificial hardware, making a “brain emulation”. With an artificial brain and body, you could live an immortal life, a life as vivid and meaningful as your life today, where you never need feel pain, disease, grime, and your body always looks and feels young and beautiful. That person might not be exactly you, but they could (at first) be as similar to you as the 2001 version of you was to you today. I describe this future world of brain emulations in great detail in my book The Age of Em. Alas, this scenario can’t work if your brain is burned or eaten by worms soon. But the info that specifies you is now only a tiny fraction of all the info in your brain and is redundantly encoded. So if we freeze all the chemical processes in your brain, either via plastination or liquid nitrogen, quite likely enough info can be found there to make a brain emulation of you. So “all” that stands between you and this future immortality is freezing your brain and then storing it until future tech improves. If you are with me so far, you now get the appeal of “cryonics”, which over the last 54 years has frozen ~500 people when the usual medical tech gave up on them. ~3000 are now signed up for this service, and the [2nd] most popular provider charges $28K, though you should budget twice that for total expenses. (The 1st most popular charges $80K.) If you value such a life at a standard $7M, this price is worth it even if this process has only a 0.8% chance of working. Its worth more if an immortal life is worth more, and more if your loved ones come along with you. So is this chance of working over 0.8%? Some failure modes seem to me unlikely: civilization collapses, frozen brains don’t save enough info, or you die in way that prevents freezing. And if billions of people used this service, there’d be a question of if the future is willing, able, and allowed to revive you. But with only a few thousand others frozen, that’s just not a big issue. All these risks together have well below a 50% chance, in my opinion. The biggest risk you face then is organizational failure. And since you don’t have to pay them if they aren’t actually able to freeze you at the right time, your main risk re your payment is re storage. Instead of storing you until future tech can revive you, they might instead mismanage you, or go bankrupt, allowing you to thaw. This already happened at one cryonics org.","If frozen today, I judge your chance of successful revival to be at least 5%, making this service worth the cost even if you value such an immortal future life at only 1/6 of a standard life. And life insurance makes it easier to arrange the payment. But more important, this is a service where the reliability and costs greatly improve with more customers. With a million customers, instead of a thousand, I estimate cost would fall, and reliability would increase, each by a factor of ten. Also, with more customers cryonics providers could afford to develop fixation, already demonstrated in research, into a practical service. This lets people be stored at room temperature, and thus ends most storage risk. Yes, with more customers, each might need to also pay to have future folks revive them, and to have something to live on once revived. But long time delays make that cheap, and so with enough customers total costs could fall to less than that of a typical funeral today. Making this a good bet for most everyone. When the choice is between a nice funeral for Aunt Sally or having Aunt Sally not actually die, who will choose the funeral? And by buying cryonics for yourself, you also help move us toward the low cost cryonics world that would be much better for everyone. Most people prefer to extend existing lives over creating new ones. Thus we reach the title claim of this post: if we coordinated to have many customers, it would be cheap for most everyone to not die. That is: most everyone who dies today doesn’t actually need to die! This is possible now. Ancient Egypt, relative rationalists among the ancients, paid to mummify millions, a substantial fraction of their population, and also a similar number of animals, in hope of later revival. But we now actually can mummify to allow revival, yet we have only done that to 500 people, over a period when over 4 billion people have died. Why so few cryonics customers? When I’ve taught health economics, over 10% of students judge the chances of cryonics working to be high enough to justify a purchase. Yet none ever buy. In a recent poll, 31.5% of my followers said they planned to sign up, but few have. So the obstacle isn’t supporting beliefs, it is the courage to act on such beliefs. It looks quite weird to act on a belief in cryonics. So weird that spouses often divorce those who do. (But not spouses who spend a similar amounts to send their ashes into space, which looks much less weird.) We like to think we tolerate diversity, and we do for unimportant stuff, but for important stuff we in fact impose strongly penalize diversity. Sure it would help if our official medical experts endorsed the idea, but they are just as scared of non-conformity, and also stuck on a broken concept of “science” which demands someone actually be revived before they can","So, even if the future is ready to revive you, you might not be there anymore. But the future is likely to be ready. I think this is the best path forward, and it’s worth the cost, even with such risks. The key is that the future is likely to be ready, and that you can always be sure that your brain is stored and not mismanaged. The problem is that the current cryonics orgs are not good at that. So, if you can find a good cryonics org, you can be sure your brain is stored, and even if the future is not ready, you might get revived by some future tech, not just the one that was planned. But how do you know which cryonics org is good? This is the problem I want to solve. I want to build a “Cryonics Rating System” that can help people find a good cryonics org. The system would use a combination of expert evaluation and user experience data. I will now describe the system in detail. The rating would be on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the best. The rating would be based on the following factors: 1. Survival rate of their patients. 2. Quality of their storage facilities. 3. How well they are organized. 4. How well they handle user experience data. 5. How well they handle user complaints. 6. How well they handle user communication. 7. How well they handle user trust. 8. How well they handle user feedback. 9. How well they handle user engagement. 10. How well they handle user retention. 11. How well they handle user satisfaction. 12. How well they handle user loyalty. 13. How well they handle user referrals. 14. How well they handle user support. 15.

Robin Hanson,Why Abstaining Helps.txt,"Misunderstandings that I heard in response to these tweets has encouraged me to try to explain more clearly the logic of why most eligible voters should abstain from voting. Think of each vote cast between two candidates as being either +1 or -1, so that the positive candidate wins if the sum of all votes cast is positive; the negative candidate wins otherwise. Abstaining is then a vote of 0. (If the vote sum is zero, the election is a tie.)
Assume that there is one binary quality variable that expresses which of the two candidates is “better for the world”, that these two options are equally likely, that each voter gets one binary clue correlated with that quality, and that voters vote simultaneously. What we should want is to increase the chance that the better candidate wins. While all else equal, each voter may prefer a higher quality candidate, they need not be otherwise indifferent. So if, based on other considerations, they have a strong enough preference for one of the candidates, such “partisan” voters will pick that candidate regardless of their clue. Thus their vote will not embody any info about candidate quality. They are so focused on other considerations that they won’t help make for a more informed election, at least not via their vote. The other “informed” voters care enough about quality that their vote will depend on their quality clue. Thus the total vote will be the sum of the partisan votes plus the informed votes. So the sum of the partisan votes will set a threshold that the informed votes must overcome to tip the election. For example, if the partisan sum is -10, then the informed votes must sum to at least 10 to tip the election toward the positive candidate. For our purposes here it won’t matter if there is uncertainty over this sum of partisan votes or not; all that matters is that the partisan sum sets the threshold that informed votes must overcome. Now in general we expect competing candidates to position themselves in political and policy spaces so that on average the partisan threshold is not too far from zero. After all, it is quite unusual for everyone to be very confident that one side will win. So I will from here on assume a zero threshold, though my analysis will be robust to modest deviations from that. Assume for now that the clues of the informed voters are statistically independent of each other, given candidate quality. Then with many informed voters the sum of informed votes will approach a normal distribution, and the chance that the positive candidate wins is near the integral of this normal distribution above the partisan threshold. Thus all that matters from each individual voter is the mean and variance of their vote. Any small correlation between a voter’s clue and quality will create a small positive correlation between quality and their mean vote.","Thus their vote will move the mean of the informed votes in the right direction. Because of this, many say that the more voters the better, no matter how poorly informed is each one. However, each informed voters adds to both the mean and the variance of the total vote, as shown in this diagram: What matters is the “z-score” of the informed vote, i.e., the mean divided by its standard deviation. The chance that the better candidate wins is increasing in this z-score. So if a voter adds proportionally more to the standard deviation than they add to the mean, they make the final vote less likely to pick the better candidate, even if their individual contribution to the mean is positive. This is why poorly informed voters who vote can hurt elections, and it is why the relevant standard is your information compared to that of the other voters who don’t abstain. If you are an informed voter who wants to increase the chance that the better candidate wins, then you should abstain if you are not sufficiently well informed compared to the others who will vote. In a previous post I considered the optimal choice of when to abstain in two extreme cases: when all other informed voters also abstain optimally, and when no one else abstains but this one voter. Realistic cases should be somewhere between these extremes. To model inequality in how informed are various voters, I chose a power law dependence of clue correlation relative to voter rank. If the power is high, then info levels fall very quickly as you move down in voter rank from the most informed voter. If the power is low, then info levels fall more slowly, and voters far down in rank may still have a lot of info. I found that for a power less than 1/2, and ten thousand informed voters, everyone should vote in both extreme cases. That is, when info is distributed equally enough, it really does help to average everyone’s clues via their votes. But for a power of 3/4, more than half should abstain even if no one else abstains, and only 6 of them should vote if all informed voters abstained optimally. For a power of 1 then 80% should abstain even if no one else does, and only 2 of them should vote if all abstain optimally. For higher powers, it gets worse. My best guess is that a power of one is a reasonable guess, as this is a very common power and also near the middle of the distribution of observed powers. Thus even if everyone else votes, for the purpose of making the total vote have a better chance of picking the better candidate, you should abstain unless you are especially well informed, relative to the others who actually vote. And the more unequal you estimate the distribution of who is how informed, the more reluctant you should be to vote. Many have claimed that it hurts","So the more correlation, the higher the mean. But the more correlation, the higher the variance, as the vote becomes more noisy. So for each voter, there is a trade-off between their vote’s mean and variance. The more they are correlated with quality, the higher the mean, but the higher the variance. The question is, what is the optimal trade-off? It is possible that a voter could be a “voter” in the traditional sense, i.e., a voter who is informed and votes for the better candidate, but it is also possible that they are a “non-voter” who abstains, and thus their vote is 0. So the question is, what is the optimal strategy for each voter, in terms of maximizing the probability that the better candidate wins, given that other voters are also trying to do the same. So we have a game, where each voter is trying to choose between voting or abstaining, to maximize the chance that the better candidate wins. So, assuming that all voters are rational and have the same preferences, we can analyze this game. Let me define a voter’s strategy as either voting or abstaining. Let’s assume that each voter is either a partisan voter or an informed voter, with the partisan voters not being influenced by their clue and voting for their preferred candidate. So the total number of informed voters is N, and the number of partisan voters is P. Let’s assume that the partisan voters are split evenly between the two candidates, so that the sum of their votes is zero. Then the sum of informed votes is the sum of the N votes, each of which is either +1 or -1, with probability 1/2. The chance that the better candidate wins is then the chance that the sum of informed votes is positive. So if we assume that each informed voter is a “voter” in the traditional sense, then the chance that the better candidate wins is the same as the chance that the sum",490,500,335,0.4018,0.5373,0.9717,0.9585,0.9837,0.8528,-0.3656,-3.298,0.4242,0.514,0.0798,0.1485,0.0257,0.0442,0.5771,0.6499,0.9745,0.9751,0.45871559633027525,0.4578096947935368,0.49740932642487046,6,7,0.9652,0.9421,0.09183673469387756,0.108,0.13432835820895522,0.9746,0.7421,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,How Does Evolution Escape Local Maxima_.txt,"I’ve spend most of my intellectual life as a theorist, but alas it has been a while since I’ve taken the time to learn a new powerful math-based theory. But in the last few days I’ve enjoyed studying Andreas Wagner’s theories of evolutionary innovation and robustness. While Wagner has some well-publicized and reviewed books, such as Arrival of the Fittest (2014) and Robustness and Evolvability in Living Systems (2005), the best description of his key results seems to be found in a largely ignored 2011 book: The Origins of Evolutionary Innovations. Which is based on many academic journal articles. In one standard conception, evolution does hill-climbing within a network of genotypes (e.g, DNA sequence), rising according to a “fitness” value associated with the phenotype (e.g., tooth length) that results from each genotype. In this conception, a big problem is local maxima: hill-climbing stops once all the neighbors of a genotype have a lower fitness value. There isn’t a way to get to a higher peak if one first must travel through a lower valley to reach it. Maybe random noise could let the process slip through a narrow shallow valley, but what about valleys that are wide and deep? (This is a familiar problem in computer-based optimization search.)
Wagner’s core model looks at the relation between genotypes and phenotypes for metabolism in an organism like E. coli. In this context, Wagner defines a genotype as the set of chemical reactions which the enzymes of an organism can catalyze, and he defines a phenotype as the set of carbon-source molecules from which an organism could create all the other molecules it needs, assuming that this source was its only place to get carbon (but allowing many sources of other needed molecules). Wagner defines the neighbors of a genotype as those that differ by just one reaction. There are of course far more types of reactions between molecules than there are types of molecules. So using Wagner’s definitions, the set of genotypes is vastly larger than the set of phenotypes. Thus a great many genotypes result in exactly the same phenotype, and in fact each genotype has many neighboring genotypes with that same exact phenotype. And if we lump all the connected genotypes that have the same phenotype together into a unit (a unit Wagner calls a “genotype network”), and then look at the network of one-neighbor connections between such units, we will find that this network is highly connected. That is, if one presumes that evolution (using a large population of variants) finds it easy to make “neutral” moves between genotypes with exactly the same phenotype, and hence the same fitness, then large networks connecting genotypes with the same phenotype imply that it only takes a few non-neutral moves between neighbors to get to most other phenotypes. There are no wide deep valleys to cross. Evolution can search large spaces of big possible changes, and doesn’t have a problem finding innovations with big differences.","Wagner argues that there are also far more genotypes than phenotypes for two other cases: the evolution of DNA sequences that set the regulatory interactions among regulatory proteins, and for the sequences of ribonucleotides or amino acids that determine the structure and chemical activity of molecules. In addition, Wagner also shows the same applies to a computer logic gate toy problem. In this problem, there are four input lines, four output lines, and sixteen binary logic gates between. The genotype specifies the type of each gate and the set of wires connecting all these things, while the phenotype is the mapping between input and output gates. Again, there are far more genotypes than phenotypes. However, the observant reader will notice that all mappings between four inputs and four outputs can be produced using only four internal gates; sixteen gates is a factor of four more than needed. But in the case of four gates the set of genotypes is not big enough compared to the set of phenotypes to allow easy evolution. For easy innovation, sixteen gates is enough, but four gates is not. If we used a larger space of genotypes within which the number of logic gates could vary, and if the fitness function had a penalty for using more logical gates, then we’d have a problem. No matter where the genotype started, evolution might quickly cut the number of gates down to the minimum needed to implement its current input-output mapping, and then after that too few neutral changes would be possible to make evolution easy. The same problem seems possible in Wagner’s core model of metabolism; if the fitness function has a penalty for the number of enzymes used, evolution might throw away enzymes not needed to produce the current phenotype, after which too few neutral changes might be possible to allow easy evolution. Wagner’s seems to suggest a solution: larger more complex systems are needed for robustness to varying environments: Based on our current knowledge, the metabolic reaction networks of E. coli and yeast comprise more than 900 chemical reactions. However in a glucose minimal environment, more than 60 percent of these reactions are silent. … Overall, in E. coli, the fraction of reactions that would not reduce bio-mass growth when eliminated exceeds 70 percent. This is … a general property of viable networks that have similar complexity. … As a metabolic generalist, the E. coli metabolic network can synthesize its biomass from more than 80 alternative carbon sources. … All these observations indicate that the large metabolic networks of free-living organisms are much more complex than necessary to sustain life in any one environment. Their complexity arises from their viability in multiple environments. A consequence is that these networks appear highly robust to reaction removal in any one environment, where every metabolic networks has multiple natural neighbors. This neutrality, however, is conditional on the environment. (pp.153-154) I’m not sure this solves the problem, however. In the logic gate toy problem, even if phenotype fitness","Hence the idea of “evolvability” is that the system is capable of exploring the space of possible genotypes to find those that have useful phenotypes. In this case, the “evolvability” of the system is a function of the structure of the genotype network. This is the idea of “robustness” (as in “robustness in living systems”).
So the point is that Wagner’s work is about the structure of the genotype space. It is about the topology of the space. If the topology is such that you can move through the space with few non-neutral steps, then the system is evolvable. So Wagner is saying that the structure of the genotype space is the key to the evolvability of the system. And if the system is robust, it is because of the structure of the genotype space. Hence, the idea that robustness and evolvability are two sides of the same coin, or at least they are related in a fundamental way.
Now, the question is: How does this relate to the idea of a “mathematical theory of evolution”?
I think that Wagner’s work is a key component of that. The key idea is that the topology of the space of possible genotypes is what makes evolution possible. The structure of the space is such that it is possible to find a genotype that has a higher fitness (i.e., a better phenotype) than the current one, even if it’s a large change. Because of the way the space is connected, you can navigate from one to another with few non-neutral steps.
So in this view, the “mathematical theory of evolution” is about the structure of the genotype space. It is about the topology of the space. It is about the way that the space is connected, and the way that the connections allow for the exploration of the space. It is about how the system can find new solutions (i.e., new genotypes with better fitness) even when",493,500,324,0.2606,0.1867,0.9894,0.9335,0.8742,0.6772,-2.7943,-7.1719,0.3774,0.3703,0.0489,0.0347,0.0104,0.0045,0.3714,0.6349,0.9707,0.9379,0.42132867132867136,0.3861209964412811,0.5132275132275133,8,7,0.9375,0.9545,0.13995943204868155,0.124,0.12962962962962962,0.9549,0.6025,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,I See Stylists Everywhere.txt,"Cole: I see dead people. Malcolm: In your dreams? [Cole shakes his head no]
Malcolm: While you’re awake? [Cole nods]
Malcolm: Dead people like, in graves? In coffins? Cole: Walking around like regular people. They don’t see each other. They only see what they want to see. They don’t know they’re dead. Malcolm: How often do you see them? Cole: All the time. They’re everywhere. The Sixth Sense. In the movie The Sixth Sense, a boy Cole can see many ghosts, ghosts who are in denial about the fact that they are ghosts. I similarly see that most of our public intellectuals are in denial about the fact that they are mainly loved for their style, not their content. Let me explain. A big reason that readers read (or listeners listen) is that reading transfers something from the mind of the writer to the mind of the reader, something that readers can then transfer to others if they themselves then write (or talk). I call that something the “content” of the writing. All the other features of writing that can’t be as easily transferred, I call “style”. Readers may enjoy and admire the styles of things they read, but they can’t as easily add those styles to their own writing. Style is of course actually valuable, at least to some degree. Style can make content easier to enjoy, accept, and understand. The only question is how much effort to put into these different aspects of writing. This difference between content and style is a continuum. For example, the main claim and argument of an essay is more content-like than are diversions and comments, which are less likely to be remembered or understood by readers. Subtext is even more style-like, as fewer readers can notice or repeat it. Subtle choice of vocabulary and sentence structure can be even more style-like. (This way to define the distinction is unusual, but seems to me more concrete than most others you will find online.)
Content being more transferable than style has some big implications. Sometimes it is easy for writers who compete with you to read your writing and then put your content into their writing. In a way that few will complain about, because in these worlds there are not property rights in such content. In this case, you have less reason to invest in content. And this is in fact the situation for some kinds of intellectuals. In contrast, this lack of property rights is less of a problem if you are a professional, paid by a client to write privately to them, on a topic of interest only to them, writings which they may then paraphrase to others. In professions such as journalism, law, therapy, math, engineering, and business, people tend to adopt relatively standard and structured writing formats. For example, each essay is usually expected to clearly telegraph one main claim and argument.","Many such professions also have their own specialized vocabularies and methods of inquiry, and their norms tend to prohibit many “fallacious” forms of argument. We tend to expect the best judges of professional writings are other professionals. Such formats and habits tend to minimize opportunities for distinct personal writer styles and to maximize the ease with which readers can find and understand the distinctive relevant content of each case. That is, such professionals write as if they were interchangeable. Such professions also often structure their relations to support property rights in writing content. Writers are either paid by specific clients to write on topics mainly of interest only to those clients, or professional norms of publication citation and priority help writers get credit for novel unique content. Note that a memo to your boss is likely to be read only by that boss, who will paraphrase your content if it is passed up the management hierarchy. In which case your content will travel further than your style. The writing style of many kinds of “public” intellectuals looks quite different from this. Such writers have much more distinctive personal styles, and allow themselves more digressions from a single main claim and argument. It is often unclear what exactly they are claiming, or which of their claims is central. And they often include examples, stories, and other discussions from which it seems hard to extract logical arguments. Such intellectuals also allow themselves a wider ranges of topics, methods of inquiry, and kinds of arguments. And for their writings we anchor more on the reactions of ordinary readers, rather than of similar professionals. A straightforward interpretation of these differences is that these intellectuals emphasize style over content, relative to professional writing, because in their world it is much easier to own style, relative to content. Such intellectuals, however, usually resist such an interpretation of their own writing. If asked to explain why their writing looks so different, they point to the generality or value-orientation of their topics, or to their need to entice a wider range of more distractable readers. Yes, they admit, they put a lot of effort into style. But this is only to make it easier for readers to enjoy, accept, and understand their content. They insist that the main reason that the world does, and should, attend to them, is their unique and valuable content. If one asks why then they don’t coordinate to create stronger property rights in content, they shrug, or suggest that the methods other professionals use won’t work for them. I find the following observation especially telling. Many writers see themselves as specializing in content, and thus feel eager to team with writers who specialize more in style, to together make writings great in both content and style. But very few writers see themselves as style specialists, eager to team with content specialists. Almost all writers instead see themselves as having access to good enough content, thank you very much. And thus we reach a","In these professions, content is more valuable and more transferable. (I think that the difference in the importance of content vs. style is especially evident in the case of technical writing, where style is not just less important, but often actively discouraged, in order to ensure that the content is understood by the audience.)
The problem is, though, that in the public intellectual world, people are often not paid for their work, so they have less incentive to invest in content. Therefore, they invest in style. They are not paid, but they can be admired. They can be celebrated. They can be seen as ""cool"" or ""intelligent"" or ""charismatic"" or ""unique"". So, they focus on style. This is the ""Sixth Sense"" in the title of this post. Most public intellectuals are in denial about the fact that they are dead. They think that their style is what they are known for, when in fact it is their style that is what is being used to transfer their content to others. (I think that the difference in the importance of content vs. style is especially evident in the case of technical writing, where style is not just less important, but often actively discouraged, in order to ensure that the content is understood by the audience.)

In the end, the conclusion is that the public intellectual is a ""ghost"" in the sense that they are not actually doing the work of writing, but are instead merely writing as a way of being seen. The content of their writing is being transferred to others through their style, but they are not actually investing in that content. So, they are like dead people in that they are not really alive, they are not actually doing the work of writing. They are only writing to be seen. They are only writing to be admired. They are only writing to be remembered. They are only writing to be known. And in that way, they are dead.

Robin Hanson,"Foom Debate, Again.txt","My ex-co-blogger Eliezer Yudkowsky last June:
I worry about conversations that go into “But X is like Y, which does Z, so X should do reinterpreted-Z”. Usually, in my experience, that goes into what I call “reference class tennis” or “I’m taking my reference class and going home”. The trouble is that there’s an unlimited number of possible analogies and reference classes, and everyone has a different one. I was just browsing old LW posts today (to find a URL of a quick summary of why group-selection arguments don’t work in mammals) and ran across a quotation from Perry Metzger to the effect that so long as the laws of physics apply, there will always be evolution, hence nature red in tooth and claw will continue into the future – to him, the obvious analogy for the advent of AI was “nature red in tooth and claw”, and people who see things this way tend to want to cling to that analogy even if you delve into some basic evolutionary biology with math to show how much it isn’t like intelligent design. For Robin Hanson, the one true analogy is to the industrial revolution and farming revolutions, meaning that there will be lots of AIs in a highly competitive economic situation with standards of living tending toward the bare minimum, and this is so absolutely inevitable and consonant with The Way Things Should Be as to not be worth fighting at all. That’s his one true analogy and I’ve never been able to persuade him otherwise. For Kurzweil, the fact that many different things proceed at a Moore’s Law rate to the benefit of humanity means that all these things are destined to continue and converge into the future, also to the benefit of humanity. For him, “things that go by Moore’s Law” is his favorite reference class. I can have a back-and-forth conversation with Nick Bostrom, who looks much more favorably on Oracle AI in general than I do, because we’re not playing reference class tennis with “But surely that will be just like all the previous X-in-my-favorite-reference-class”, nor saying, “But surely this is the inevitable trend of technology”; instead we lay out particular, “Suppose we do this?” and try to discuss how it will work, not with any added language about how surely anyone will do it that way, or how it’s got to be like Z because all previous Y were like Z, etcetera.

When we shared this blog, Eliezer and I had a long debate here on his “AI foom” claims. Later, we debated in person once. (See also slides 34,35 of this 3yr-old talk.) I don’t accept the above as characterizing my position well. I’ve written up a summaries before, but let me try again, this time trying to more directly address the above critique.","Eliezer basically claims that the ability of an AI to change its own mental architecture is such a potent advantage as to make it likely that a cheap unnoticed and initially low ability AI (a mere “small project machine in a basement”) could without warning over a short time (e.g., a weekend) become so powerful as to be able to take over the world. As this would be a sudden big sustainable increase in the overall growth rate in the broad capacity of the world economy, I do find it useful to compare to compare this hypothesized future event to the other pasts events that produce similar outcomes, namely a big sudden sustainable global broad capacity rate increase. The last three were the transitions to humans, farming, and industry. I don’t claim there is some hidden natural law requiring such events to have the same causal factors or structure, or to appear at particular times. But I do think these events suggest a useful if weak data-driven prior on the kinds of factors likely to induce such events, on the rate at which they occur, and on their accompanying inequality in gains. In particular, they tell us that such events are very rare, that over the last three events gains have been spread increasingly equally, and that these three events seem mainly due to better ways to share innovations. Eliezer sees the essence of his scenario as being a change in the “basic” architecture of the world’s best optimization process, and he sees the main prior examples of this as the origin of natural selection and the arrival of humans. He also sees his scenario as differing enough from the other studied growth scenarios as to make analogies to them of little use. However, since most global bio or econ growth processes can be thought of as optimization processes, this comes down to his judgement on what counts as a “basic” structure change, and on how different such scenarios are from other scenarios. And in my judgement the right place to get and hone our intuitions about such things is our academic literature on global growth processes. Economists have a big literature on processes by which large economies grow, increasing our overall capacities to achieve all the things we value. There are of course many other growth literatures, and some of these deal in growths of capacities, but these usually deal with far more limited systems. Of these many growth literatures it is the economic growth literature that is closest to dealing with the broad capability growth posited in a fast growing AI scenario. It is this rich literature that seems to me the right place to find and hone our categories for thinking about growing broadly capable systems. One should review many formal theoretical models, and many less formal applications of such models to particular empirical contexts, collecting “data” points of what is thought to increase or decrease growth of what in what contexts, and collecting useful categories for","(more)

Robin Hanson,The World Forager Elite.txt,"My last post was on Where’s My Flying Car?, which argues that changing US attitudes created a tsunami of reluctance and regulation that killed nuclear power, planes, and ate the future that could have been. This explanation, however, has a problem: if there are many dozens of nations, how can regulation in one nation kill a tech? Why would regulatory choices be so strongly correlated across nations? If nations compete, won’t one nation forgoing a tech advantage make others all the more eager to try it? Now as nuclear power tech is close to nuclear weapon tech, maybe major powers exerted strong pressures re how others pursued nuclear power. Also, those techs are high and require large scales, limiting how many nations could feasibly do them differently. But we also see high global correlation for many other kinds of regulation. For example, as Hazlett explains, the US started out with a reasonable property approach to spectrum, but then Hoover broke that on purpose, to create a problem he could solve via nationalization, thereby gaining political power that helped him become U.S. president. Pretty much all other nations then copied this bad US approach, instead of the better prior property approach, and kept doing so for many decades. The world has mostly copied bad US approaches to over-regulating planes as well. We also see regulatory convergence in topics like human cloning; many had speculated that China would be defy the consensus elsewhere against it, but that turned out not to be true. Public prediction markets on interesting topics seems to be blocked by regulations almost everywhere, and insider trading laws are most everywhere an obstacle to internal corporate markets. Back in February we saw a dramatic example of world regulatory coordination. Around the world public health authorities were talking about treating this virus like they had treated all the others in the last few decades. But then world elites talked a lot, and suddenly they all agreed that this virus must be treated differently, such as with lockdowns and masks. Most public health authorities quickly caved, and then most of the world adopted the same policies. Contrarian alternatives like variolation, challenge trials, and cheap fast lower-reliability tests have also been rejected everywhere; small experiments have not even been allowed. One possible explanation for all this convergence is that regulators are just following what is obviously the best policy. But if you dig into the details you will quickly see that the usual policies are not at all obviously right. Often, they seem obviously wrong. And having all the regulatory bodies suddenly change at once, even when no new strong evidence appeared, seems especially telling. It seems to me that we instead have a strong world culture of regulators, driven by a stronger world culture of elites. Elites all over the world talk, and then form a consensus, and then authorities everywhere are pressured into following that consensus.","Regulators most everywhere are quite reluctant to deviate from what most other regulators are doing; they’ll be blamed far more for failures if they deviate. If elites talk some more, and change their consensus, then authorities must then change their polices. On topic X, the usual experts on X are part of that conversation, but often elites overrule them, or choose contrarians from among them, and insist on something other than what most X experts recommend. This looks a lot like the ancient forager system of conflict resolution within bands. Forager bands would gossip about a problem, come to a consensus about what to do, and then everyone would just do that. Because each one would lose status if they didn’t. In this system, there were no formal rules, and on the surface everyone had an equal say, though in fact some people had a lot more prestige and thus a lot more influence. This world system also looks new – I doubt this description applied as well to the world centuries or millennia ago, even within smaller regions. So this looks like another way in which our world has become more forager-like over the last few centuries, as we’ve felt more rich and safe. Big world wars probably cut into this feeling, so there was probably a big jump in the few decades after WWII, helping to explain the big change in attitudes ~1970. Elites like to talk about this system as if it were “democratic”, so that any faction that opposes it “undermines democracy”. And it is true that this system isn’t run by a central command structure. But it is also far from egalitarian. It embodies a huge inequality of influence, even if individuals within it claim that they are mainly driven by trying to help the world, or “the little guy”. This system seems a big obstacle for my hopes to create better policy institutions driven by expert understanding of institutions, and to get trials to test and develop such things. Because as soon as any policy choice seems important, such by triggering moral feelings, world elite culture feels free to gossip and then pressure authorities to adopt whatever solution their gossip prefers. Experts can only influence policy via their prestige. Very prestigious types of experts, such as in physics, can win, especially on topics about which world elites care little. But otherwise, elite gossip wins, whenever it bothers to generate an opinion. That is, the global Overton window isn’t much wider than are local Overton windows, and often excludes a lot of valuable options. Notice that in this kind of world, policy has varied far more across time than across space. Context and fashion change with time, and then elites sometimes change their minds. So perhaps my hopes for policy experiments must wait for the long run. Or for a fall of forager values, such as seems likely in an Age of Em. Alas neither I nor my allies have sufficient prestige to push elites","So maybe the reason that we see such strong regulatory convergence is that elites have formed a shared worldview, and then regulators are just implementing that worldview. So when the US government tried to go back to its old policy on the space shuttle, which had been more efficient, it was not just the government that was in error, but the whole world. That’s a very strange thing. The world is supposed to be a place of diversity, of many different things happening at once, but it seems that we are in a world where most things are the same, and that the same thing is usually the same for all nations. This is especially strange when you think that the US is the only nation that has ever had a strong, independent, and functioning national government. In fact, the US government has been in a lot of cases the one that was trying to do the right thing, and in other cases the one that was trying to do the wrong thing. But in the other nations, they were just copying the US. So the US is not just a nation, but a model. The question is, then, why does the US model have such a strong influence? Is it because the US is the only one with a strong government? Or is it because of something else? Let me think. One possibility is that the US model is based on certain values, like freedom, individualism, and a strong government. Wait, but the US government is not actually that strong, in the sense that it doesn't have a lot of power over the states. In fact, the US is not even the only one with a strong government. The UK has a strong government, and other nations like China and Germany have strong governments as well. But the US is the only one that has a strong government with a high degree of independence and functioning. That might be the reason. Or perhaps the US is the only one that has a strong government that is both independent and functioning.

Robin Hanson,"Friends, Factions, And Status.txt","We have three different kinds of reasons to favor others: friends, factions, and status. First, we favor those to whom we have relatively direct connections: friends, family, co-workers, neighbors, sport teammates, church-mates, etc. Second, we favor other members of our self-promoting groups, where each such group makes up a substantial fraction of our relevant society. Such as groups who share gender, ethnicity, education level, or religion. Third, we favor people we see as having prestige or dominance, and are thus accepted by most everyone as being better than others. Over time, groups can move between these roles. For example, Christianity started out as small groups who favored each other due to their direct connections. Then it became a repressed minority faction within the Roman Empire, then a large faction, and then the largest dominant fraction, where it repressed others. Over the following centuries Christianity became so dominant, at least in areas near Europe, that it became part of the local concept of status; Christians were higher status than heathens or atheists, and status within Christianity counted as social status more generally. Lately, Christianity has retreated to become more of a strong faction. Similarly, science started out as small community, then became a minor faction, but by now has become entrenched and dominant in our society. That is, most everyone accepts that being more scientific is better overall for your status. Anti-science factions are repressed factions, when they are allowed at all. For example, we fight over if economics is “science” as a way to fight over it s status. Another example is prestigious college degrees. Once these were an optional and contested status marker, but now they are almost universally seen as a powerful marker, quite often required for any elite position. Over the last few centuries, “liberation” movements have succeeded in moving some group differences in the other direction, from status to faction. For example, regarding aristocrats, ethnicities, gender, and sexual preferences. Previously these were all widely accepted as status markers, with some types better than others, but recently they have come more to be seen as just more ways that people can be different. Some now try to induce similar changes in how we treat looks, age, and urban/rural, but they have so far largely failed. Humans have long worried that allegiances to friends or factions would interfere with loyalty to other shared units. So regarding friends and family favoritism, firms limit nepotism, judges recuse themselves when they have personal connections, and teachers aren’t supposed to grade their friends, family, or lovers. Regarding faction favoritism, humans have long had neutrality norms to limit such favoritism. As a result, faction favoritism is a common “hidden motive” to which we are often consciously blind, like other hidden motives we discuss in our book Elephant in the Brain. For example, you are supposed to set aside faction allegiances when you rule as a judge, or grade as a teacher, or review a journal article.","As a firm representative or responsible professional, you aren’t supposed to give better or cheaper service to customers who share your factions. In a firm, you are supposed to argue for choices of personnel, projects, or policies based on what is good for the firm as a whole, not for your within-firm factions. Some legal rules of evidence, and common norms of good debate, can be seen as trying limit factional support. For example, rules against hearsay can discourage factions from getting their members to lie for each other, and rules against revealing prior criminal convictions to jurors may prevent conviction-correlated faction action. And debate norms that discourage group-based insults or appeals to authority or popularity can also discourage factional coordination. In most ancient societies, there was usually a single dominant power coalition, and this still holds for most democratic cities today. The founders of US democracy worried a lot about democratic polities plagued by factions. They thought they had a fix (many small ones), but they were wrong; in larger democratic polities, we’ve often seen a consistent split into two main roughly-equally-strong political factions. Which subgroups comprise these two factions changes during rare “political realignments.” And in such polities, people like judges, teachers, or generals who represent the polity as a whole are usually expected to set aside their affiliations with these two political factions when making key decisions. In such polities, it is more okay to say that you favor particular political candidates because they favor your factions. But even there we prefer factions to say that they are trying to do good for the polity as a whole. Valid factions, we say, merely hold different opinions on what is good for us all. Yes, we are aware that factions may hypocritically pretend to serve the general good while actually serving themselves. We are also aware that high status groups like the top-college-educated may in part just be self-favoring factions so powerful that they suppress any substantial opposition. Even so, we prefer hypocrisy to more overt factional self-dealing, and we prefer to suppress the factions that we can suppress rather than to suppress none at all. In the U.S. since WWII, we have seen increasing and now record “polarization” between the main two political factions. And recently we’ve seen the relatively new phenomena of “reverse discrimination”, whereby some groups which were first seen as low in status, and then second were supposed to be treated neutrally as just another faction, are now third to be treated in key selection processes as if they were actually higher in status, to correct for their past lower status. Is this a new political realignment? I actually think it is even bigger; we are now seeing a political faction make a bid for promotion, from faction to status. They want most everyone to accept that their side is just morally better. This faction has come to dominate the most prestigious high ends of many social high grounds: tech, academia, media, civil service,","But even when you try to be neutral, you may be influenced by your faction. For example, if you are a member of the feminist faction, you may be more sympathetic to a feminist article, or if you are a member of the science faction, you may be more sympathetic to a science article. This is why, for example, there is so much controversy about whether economics is a science. Similarly, in the case of a judge, you are supposed to be neutral, but the judge is likely to be influenced by the faction of the person they are judging. For example, if the defendant is a member of a group that is favored by the judge’s own faction, the judge may be more sympathetic. This is also why, in the case of a scientific journal, you are supposed to be neutral, but the journal is likely to be influenced by the faction of the author, and so they are more likely to accept articles from authors who are part of the science faction. These hidden motives are important, because they influence our decisions in ways that are often not consciously recognized. They also have a negative effect on the quality of our decisions, because they can lead to biased decisions, especially when the hidden motive is in conflict with the explicit norm or rule that we are supposed to be neutral. The hidden motives for favoring others also have a positive effect on the quality of our decisions. For example, when people are more sympathetic to members of their own faction, they are more likely to be fair to them, because they are more likely to see their own faction as being in the right. That is, when you are sympathetic to your own faction, you are more likely to be fair to them, which is a positive effect. However, this is only a positive effect when the hidden motive is in the same direction as the explicit rule. If the hidden motive is in the opposite direction, like if you are supposed to be neutral, but you are sympathetic to your own faction, and you",493,500,357,0.2276,0.1977,0.9682,0.9225,0.9338,0.7248,1.415,7.5785,0.3718,0.3401,0.0369,0.0591,0.0051,0.0087,0.411,0.3963,0.9808,0.9499,0.386986301369863,0.3954305799648506,0.5575,7,5,0.9721,0.9918,0.17647058823529413,0.138,0.11484593837535013,0.961,0.5949,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Beware Moral Fashion.txt,"Many things change. Outside of humans: cosmology, geology, climate, biology. Among humans: cities, machines, housing, language, clothes, morals, conversation topics. Dead things change due to interactions, decay, cycles, collisions. Life also changes via evolution, where many pretty random changes appear, from which selection chooses the best, leading to progress over time. Human culture also evolves via cultural evolution. Among humans, we also see changes we call fashion. In the short term, fashion changes look much like evolution changes, with some initially-random variations growing in popularity, as if they had superior lasting value. But then these changes go away, replaced by new fashions, without net gains resulting. Often such changes go through recognizable cycles, such as hair being short then long then short, etc. These changes don’t seem explainable via simple randomness, lasting innovation, or changes matched to relevant context (like climate). (Typically such fashions wander in a limited space, causing no net long term harm, but without such limits more harm can result.)
The usual explanation for fashion, which makes sense to me, is that humans assign higher status not only to people who help initiate lasting innovations, but also to those who help initiate more temporary fashion changes. After all, those who start both kinds of changes, or join them earlier than others, show impressive cleverness, perception, info sources, and social influence. This creates incentives to try to make and join new fashions, and to drop them when enough low status folks embrace them. To serve this purpose, new fashions only have to be not clearly worse than prior ones. Relative to efforts to induce lasting innovations, efforts to induce fashion changes seem more of a social waste. But compared to impressing others via war, they seem less of a waste. Also, most ancient societies had little of innovation or fashion, and Europe started to have lots of fashion ~1400, well before it started to have lots of innovation. So a love of fashion might have led to a love of exploration and innovation; we may have fashion to thank for modern innovation rates. We tend to see more fashion changes in things that are more socially visible, that are more a matter of individual than collective choice, and that are capable of changing faster and cheaper. I also think we also see more fashion where we less agree on evaluation criteria. For example, while many costs and revenues contribute to firm profitability, we agree to measure profit as total revenue minus total cost, using exactly unit weights on each different kind of cost and revenue. We could imagine a world where such weights varied from unity over time according to fashions, but that isn’t our world. Similarly, we consistently measure the height of a person or building as the min distance, when they are stable, from their highest peak to the ground.","There are thousands of other possible ways we could define “height”, and we could imagine a world where they often change how they define height according to fashion. But that is not our world. We also don’t see much fashion in engineering designs for behind-the-scenes structures like nails, screws, tapes, and trusses. Plausibly because we mostly agree on the engineering criteria by which to evaluate such designs. Yet we see greatly changing fashions in many areas where diverse factors contribute to value, and we disagree on relative factor contributions. Such as in clothing, furniture, music, literature, and politics. The explanation here, plausibly, is that we are reluctant to admit to supporting fashions, as opposed to innovations. We instead want to presume that any change we support has a decent chance of becoming a lasting innovation; it seems actually better. And we can only reasonably presume this while pushing fashions in areas where relative priorities are in substantial doubt. For example, we can find many reasons why the new striped socks fashion seems more aesthetic, at least in our current context, and no one can prove otherwise. This seems harder re screw design. This view of fashion helps us to see just how much trouble we are in from cultural drift, and also how we might perhaps fix it. While we have little to fear from cultural evolution tied to measurable outcomes (e.g., copying fishers who catch more fish), we have more to fear from cultural evolution not tied to such outcomes, and with features shared within cultures. Such as the evolution of morals, norms, and status markers. Not only do we now have historically low levels of variety and selection pressures re such shared cultural features, but also historically high rates of change. And these changes just are not plausibly mostly adaptive. Yes, some value changes are plausibly due to ancient evolved conditional value strategies, by which our values change with context like density, relatedness, sex ratios, mortality rates, pathogen prevalence, and resource availability, patchiness, and predictability. But today, most seems due to moral/norm fashion change. The only discussion I’ve found of moral fashion is by Paul Graham: Did we actually dress like that? We did. And we had no idea how silly we looked. It's the nature of fashion to be invisible. … What scares me is that there are moral fashions too. They're just as arbitrary, and just as invisible to most people. But they're much more dangerous. Fashion is mistaken for good design; moral fashion is mistaken for good. … What would someone coming back to visit us in a time machine have to be careful not to say? That's what I want to study here. But I … want to find general recipes for discovering what you can't say, in any era. (More) Alas, Graham treats fashion change as clothing-fashion-like white noise, randomly sampling from a limited space, and at each time distorting a limited fraction of morals. In which case, his strategy should work: find","But if we allowed for the height of a person to be measured as the distance from the ground to the top of their head when standing, or to the top of their shoulders when sitting, or the height of their legs when lying down, etc., we might see a different height measurement. We can also imagine that, in some cultures, people might prefer to measure the height of a building as the distance from the ground to the top of the highest peak, rather than the base. But in our world, we have fixed measurements, which allow us to compare things across time and across cultures. We can also imagine that in some cultures, people might prefer to measure the height of a building as the distance from the ground to the top of the highest peak, but that’s not how we do it. So, when we see something as being more or less fashion, it’s because the society has established certain criteria for evaluating that thing, and those criteria are not necessarily aligned with the actual value or practicality of the thing. In this way, fashion is a kind of social evaluation system that is not based on objective criteria, but on subjective, culturally influenced judgments.
But here is the twist: these subjective, culturally influenced judgments can be quite powerful. If the society values a certain fashion, it can create a lot of social pressure to conform to it, and this can have a significant impact on individuals. This is why, for example, people may feel compelled to follow certain trends in fashion, even if they don’t personally agree with them. The same can be true for other aspects of social behavior, such as music, art, or even political ideologies. The key is that these social pressures are not necessarily aligned with objective measures of value, but they are deeply rooted in the culture and the values of the society. This means that fashion is not just a matter of individual choice, but it is also a reflection of the values and norms of the society as a whole.

Robin Hanson,I Fear Maladaptive Culture.txt,"I’ve been reading, thinking, and talking, trying to get clearer on what exactly are the culture problems I’m worried about, and how best to describe them. I seek descriptions not only easy for an outsider public to understand, but also for prestigious insider specialists to embrace. It seems “maladaptive culture” might be a better name for the problem. So that is the title of this post. Also, I tentatively see four key ways to distinguish more from less problematic cases; the big problems that I fear sit mainly in one corner of that 16-cornered 4D cube of possibilities. Here are the four dimensions:
1. First, culture can work great when tied to particular relevant observable outcomes and inputs. If you want to catch more fish, it can make sense to copy the fishing-related behaviors of the people around you who catch the most fish. You need to be able to tell who gets more fish value (e.g., quantity and size) per effort invested (e.g., time and harms) and you also need to be able to tell which of these folks’ many features and behaviors are plausibly oriented to catching fish. So you can’t do this sort of cultural change until you’ve developed sufficient “cultural gadgets” to see these things. But once you do, things can work great. The problem I’m worried about arises when it gets harder to apply such conditional strategies, because it gets harder to identify particular relevant observable outcomes and inputs. In this case, you can instead try the relatively unconditional strategy of copying most all behaviors of people (of your species) who are overall successful, without much distinguishing which of their behaviors lead to which success outcomes. As this is sensitive to how exactly one judges “success”, it can go wrong in big ways. But this sort of unconditional copying was probably our main cultural engine when human culture first got going. 2. Second, culture works great when deviant trials can be small, and there are only weak conformity pressures and penalties for deviating from typical behavior. In this case many different things can be tried, and the best versions can slowly come to dominate practice. The problem I’m worried about arises when trials require huge groups to coordinate to create them, when trials need very long periods to test them, or when the larger culture coordinates to punish and repress deviant behavior. For example, murder habits are greatly suppressed by norms and laws against murder. In the US today, so are habits of racist verbal expressions. In the face of strong conformity pressures, deviations are unlikely to become common, even if they would be individually beneficial in the absence of these pressures. When cultures coordinate via conformity pressures to induce similar behavior in all members, effective cultural evolution of that sort of behavior requires selection of cultures, not just selection within cultures.","And effective selection of cultures requires there to be enough sufficiently-insulated-from-each-other cultures with different conformity pressures, and also a sufficient rate at which new cultures are born, and others die, due to famine, pandemic, invasion, and emigration. I worry that our world today lacks sufficient variety and selection of norm-setting macro cultures. 3. Third, the potentially-problematic combination of unconditional copying of culture-shared norms, status markers, and other conformity coordination points, in a context of low cultural variety and selection, would still not actually be that much of a problem if such norms, etc. were stable, and not very sensitive to context. After all, our ancestors have already long experienced great variety and selection pressures, so if the solutions that they found before were robust and likely to continue to work in our new technical and social environments, we could just continue to use them now. The lack of much variety or selection of cultures now would prevent us from improving on those solutions, but not from continuing to use them profitably. But in fact, most world cultures have long seemed to experience high and increasing rates of change in their norms and status markers, changes driven mostly from within those cultures. In fact, great energies are devoted to inducing such changes, and to fights over their directions, with great prestige accruing to fight winners. As these changes are only moderately predictable, I find it hard to see them as adaptive. And the world’s long fertility fall suggests to me that they are in fact maladaptive. If so, the world’s main cultures are plausibly going “off the rails.” 4. Fourth, even fast cultural change of unconditionally copied norms in a context of low cultural variety and weak selection might still be okay if, as some suggest, human cultural change were actually mainly caused by reason. If humans first evolved a powerful ability to reason about which behaviors of whom are useful to copy how, and this reasoning ability induced people to actually copy particular behaviors, then the rapid culture changes we see now would plausibly then mostly be reasonable. They would on average make sense, even if errors resulted in particular cases. The fact that we are unaware of this reasoning, and can’t understand or predict its results, need not imply that they don’t make sense. However, the consensus of the field of cultural evolution, as best I can read it, agrees with my estimation that cultural evolution came first, and reason second. We quite commonly seem to use reason only to justify decisions we came to in other ways. And only a few small DNA changes were needed to change something like chimps into creatures that could habitually accumulate culture. With that ability they could much more rapidly acquire many “cultural gadgets”, including powerful abilities to reason, including about when to copy who. But in this scenario it seems implausible that cultural evolution would let each new gadget to totally overrule the choices it would otherwise make. Culture would more","3. Third, culture works great when there is a strong, shared, internalized, and stable belief in the value of the culture. In this case, people are more likely to be willing to put in the effort to maintain it, to pass it on, to improve it, and to adapt it. The problem arises when the belief in the value of the culture is weak, fragmented, or even hostile. When people don't believe in the value of the culture, they don’t care to maintain, improve, or adapt it. When people are hostile, they might even actively try to destroy it. When culture is seen as bad, people may try to replace it. When people are unsure of its value, they may be more prone to change it for other things. 4. Fourth, culture works great when it’s possible to get feedback from the environment, and to adjust the culture accordingly. In this case, people can learn from their experiences and adjust their behaviors. The problem arises when the environment is not responsive, or when people are not responsive to the environment. In the case of the environment, for the culture to adapt, it must be possible to get feedback, which means the environment must be able to provide useful information about what works and what doesn’t. In the case of the people, this requires a culture that allows people to process that information and make changes accordingly. The problem I’m worried about arises when people are not responsive to the environment, when they are not open to learning. This can be the case when people are too attached to their beliefs, when they are in a state of denial, or when they are overly confident in their own beliefs and not open to new information. This is the case of a culture that is not only not adaptive, but also not even aware that it is not adaptive.

Robin Hanson,Economists Rarely Say “Nothing But”.txt,"Imagine someone said:
Those physicists go too far. They say conservation of momentum applies exactly at all times to absolutely everything in the universe. And yet they can’t predict whether I will raise my right or left hand next. Clearly there is more going on than their theories can explain. They should talk less and read more literature. Maybe then they’d stop saying immoral things like Earth’s energy is finite. Sounds silly, right? But many literary types really don’t like economics (in part due to politics), and they often try to justify their dislike via a similar critique. They say that we economists claim that complex human behavior is “nothing but” simple economic patterns. For example, in the latest New Yorker magazine, journalist and novelist John Lanchester tries to make such a case in an article titled:
Can Economists and Humanists Ever Be Friends? One discipline reduces behavior to elegantly simple rules; the other wallows in our full, complex particularity. What can they learn from each other? He starts by focusing on our book Elephant in the Brain. He says we make reasonable points, but then go too far:
The issue here is one of overreach: taking an argument that has worthwhile applications and extending it further than it usefully goes. Our motives are often not what they seem: true. This explains everything: not true. … Erving Goffman’s “The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life,” or … Pierre Bourdieu’s masterpiece “Distinction” … are rich and complicated texts, which show how rich and complicated human difference can be. The focus on signalling and unconscious motives in “The Elephant in the Brain,” however, goes the other way: it reduces complex, diverse behavior to simple rules. This intellectual overextension is often found in economics, as Gary Saul Morson and Morton Schapiro explain in their wonderful book “Cents and Sensibility: What Economics Can Learn from the Humanities” (Princeton). … Economists tend to be hedgehogs, forever on the search for a single, unifying explanation of complex phenomena. They love to look at a huge, complicated mass of human behavior and reduce it to an equation: the supply-and-demand curves; the Phillips curve … or mb=mc. … These are powerful tools, which can be taken too far. You might think that Lanchester would support his claim that we overreach by pointing to particular large claims and then offering evidence that they are false in particular ways. Oddly, you’d be wrong. (Our book mentions no math nor rules of any sort.) He actually seems to accept most specific claims we make, even pretty big ones:
Many of the details of Hanson and Simler’s thesis are persuasive, and the idea of an “introspective taboo” that prevents us from telling the truth to ourselves about our motives is worth contemplating. … The writers argue that the purpose of medicine is as often to signal concern as it is to cure disease.","They propose that the purpose of religion is as often to enhance feelings of community as it is to enact transcendental beliefs. … Some of their most provocative ideas are in the area of education, which they believe is a form of domestication. … Having watched one son go all the way through secondary school, and with another who still has three years to go, I found that account painfully close to the reality of what modern schooling is like. While Lanchester does argue against some specific claims, these are not claims that we actually made. For example: “The Elephant in the Brain”… has moments of laughable wrongness. We’re told, “Maya Angelou … managed not to woo Bill Clinton with her poetry but rather to impress him—so much so that he invited her to perform at his presidential inauguration in 1993.” The idea that Maya Angelou’s career amounts to nothing more than a writer shaking her tail feathers to attract the attention of a dominant male is not just misleading; it’s actively embarrassing. But we said nothing like “Angelou’s career amounts to nothing more than.” Saying that she impressed Clinton with her poetry is not remotely to imply there was “nothing more” to her career. Also: More generally, Hanson and Simler’s emphasis on signalling and unconscious motives suggests that the most important part of our actions is the motives themselves, rather than the things we achieve. … The last sentence of the book makes the point that “we may be competitive social animals, self-interested and self-deceived, but we cooperated our way to the god-damned moon.” With that one observation, acknowledging that the consequences of our actions are more important than our motives, the argument of the book implodes. We emphasize “signalling and unconscious motives” because is the topic of our book. We don’t ever say motives are the most important part of our actions, and as he notes, in our conclusion we suggest the opposite. Just as a book on auto repair doesn’t automatically claim auto repair to be the most important thing in the world, a book on hidden motives needn’t claim motives are the most important aspect of our lives. And we don’t. In attributing “overreach” to us, Lanchester seems to rely most heavily on a quick answer I gave in an interview, where Tyler Cowen asked me to respond “in as crude or blunt terms as possible”: Wait, though—surely signalling doesn’t account for everything? Hanson … was asked to give a “short, quick and dirty” answer to the question of how much human behavior “ultimately can be traced back to some kind of signalling.” His answer: “In a rich society like ours, well over ninety per cent.” … That made me laugh, and also shake my head. … There is something thrilling about the intellectual audacity of thinking that you can explain ninety per cent of behavior in a society with one mental tool. That quote is not from our book, and is from a context where","… The idea that our motives are often not what we think they are is true. … We don’t argue that all motives are hidden, just that most are. … We don’t argue that all motives are unconscious, just that many are. … We don’t argue that all human behavior is governed by a single set of principles, just that many behaviors are. … We don’t argue that all human behavior is irrational, just that many is irrational. … We don’t argue that all human behavior is selfish, just that many is selfish. … The point is not to reduce the complexity of human behavior, but to explain it in terms of the simple, underlying principles that govern it. … So, we are not overreaching, we are being practical.
So, in response to Lanchester, we would say that the criticism is not that we are wrong, but that it is not the right way to criticize us. He is trying to say that we are wrong by saying that we are too simple, but in fact we are right by saying that we are too simple. That is, the criticism is a bit of a self-contradiction. The problem is not that we are too simple, but that we are too complex. The problem is that he is too complex. He is trying to use a complex, multifaceted critique to criticize us for being too simple, but in doing so he is himself too complex, and not simple enough to understand our point. The problem is that he is too complex. He is trying to use a complex, multifaceted critique to criticize us for being too simple, but in doing so he is himself too complex, and not simple enough to understand our point.

Robin Hanson,Futarchy Futurism.txt,"I have often taken on the role of econ futurist, analyzing the social consequences of particular future techs. For example, see my book The Age of Em. I am also the inventor of a new form of governance, futarchy, which is now finally seeing some substantial trials, 25 years after its invention. Which is making me realize that it’s high time I analyzed the social consequences of this as a futuristic tech. That is, how might the world change if this tech ends up being a promising as I’ve long thought? Futarchy recruits speculative market traders to advise decisions. So its value is largest for high value decisions made by actors centralized enough to coordinate to pay for advice, and where some speculators are able to collect relevant info. The obvious top candidate here is: org, not personal, decisions. My default scenario re any new tech is a mostly gradual spread of adoption, across industries, org types, and decision topic areas. Gradual because people don’t believe a new thing might work for them until they see it applied to something pretty close to their application area. And because typically each new area does need some new different implementation details, that need concrete experiments to work out. First, let’s try to identify some key dimensions of uncertainty that make this all hard to predict. One key variable is how many messy details we will have to invent or discover before futarchy can be effective across as wide scope of applications. The fewer such details, the faster autarchy might spread, and the bigger the jumps we might see from some application areas to others. Another key variable is how futarchy will be framed politically, so that people will oppose it just to support their political side, regardless of its effectiveness. With different framings it gets different allies and detractors, and so is adopted faster among allies than among detractors. This may also influence the metrics by which it is judged. A third key variable is how large a moat will futarchy supplying firms be able to generate. The larger the moat, the more concentrated will be this industry. I don’t see big moats yet, but we can expect firms to be creative in trying to generate them. Okay, second, let’s try to predict the early applications of futarchy. One predictor of where futarchy will be applied first is the value of advice on particular decisions. This is correlated with the size of an org, and the size of particular decisions at issue in that org. Futarchy is better at stopping a few big bad lumpy changes than at preventing a slow gradual decline due to many small decisions. And better at pushing a few big lumpy radical improvements, than promoting gradual gains. Futarchy works best outside the Overton window. Decision value is also correlated with the dysfunction of the org’s existing processes. The more that pride or politics distorts decisions today, the better.","By this measure government or charity orgs seem especially promising. Another predictor of early applications is potential for learning. Early applications are not just where big value could be realized, but also where many similar decisions for which key outcomes are quickly revealed. As this is where the most experimentation can take place, to work out key institutional details, and prove effectiveness to skeptical audiences. Maybe new hire decisions, and project deadline decisions. A third application predictor is powerful owners. When owners of the org are more in control, more eager to efficiently achieve their goals, and better able to understand the power of speculative markets, the more quickly they will adopt futarchy. This points most strongly to privately held for-profit orgs. A fourth application predictor is where relevant outcome measures are simpler, harder to manipulate, and more agreed on. Such as with for-profit orgs with a public stock price, or crypto orgs with a public coin price. The thicker the markets in these value metrics, the better, as that adds subsidy to trading and makes it easier for market price differences to show smaller value differences. A fifth application predictor is the number of people who could plausibly learn about a decision and trade on it without revealing their identity, to avoid org retaliation. So small secretive orgs where only a few can access relevant info are not good candidates. A sixth predictor is how powerful, entrenched, and proud are existing deciders. The more that the people who now make these decisions feel that making or influencing such decisions is a big part of their power, prestige, and identity, the less they will be willing to let futarchy decide instead. This is why org funding seems a promising application; bosses have never been in simple control of their funding. Two decades ago, prediction markets had the most success replacing focus groups and picking new innovation projects, both areas where existing managers are not used to nor much inclined to express opinions. (Such markets typically predicted end of market prices, not actual choice consequences.) Okay, we’ve sought key variables of uncertainty, and tried to identify early application areas. Now let’s try to foresee longer term consequences. Imagine a world where futarchy has spread far and wide, to be as ubiquitous as is cost-accounting, statistics, or randomized trials today. How is that world different? In such a world orgs should be larger, as their more effective governance reduces the scale diseconomies that limit org sizes today. Governments and nonprofits may also encompass more social activity, if they can learn to adopt simple robust futarchy outcome measures. This plausibly cuts their disadvantages relative to for profit orgs today. We might well even get bigger national alliances, or even a world government. In this world, the social status of arguing over facts and casual effects should decline relative to that of arguing over values, especially values expressed as measurable outcomes. While fact disputes will be settled in the speculative markets, value disputes will","The more that the decision is a high-stakes, high-impact, high-value, high-potential for change, the better. The more that the decision is of a type that can be made in a short time, the better. Also, the more that the decision is of a type that is currently made by people with a lot of incentive to keep the status quo. So the first applications of futarchy will be in orgs where: 1. There is a high value of the decision, 2. The org is large and has a high level of decision-making power, 3. The decision is high-stakes, high-impact, and high-potential for change, 4. The decision is of a type that can be made in a short time, 5. The decision is currently made by people with a lot of incentive to keep the status quo. Now, what are the orgs that fit these criteria? The obvious candidates are: - Government (e.g., the U.S. federal government) - Large corporations (e.g., oil companies, defense contractors, etc.) - Nonprofits, especially those with large budgets and high-impact missions (e.g., the UN, the Red Cross, etc.) - Large universities, especially those with significant decision-making power (e.g., the University of California system) - Large international organizations (e.g., the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund) - Large financial institutions (e.g., banks, investment firms, hedge funds) - Large research institutions (e.g., NASA, CERN, etc.) These are all orgs that are large, have high decision-making power, and where decisions are high-stakes and high-impact. Now, given that, I think the first applications of futarchy will be in the above-mentioned orgs. But, I should consider that futarchy is not yet effective. So the first applications may be in smaller orgs, or in orgs",491,500,283,0.2905,0.1632,0.9808,0.9374,0.9861,0.5077,0.25,-8.7554,0.3773,0.2911,0.0385,0.0413,0.0049,0.0089,0.4887,0.4568,0.969,0.9302,0.3964285714285714,0.3674911660777385,0.3631123919308357,6,7,0.9884,0.8071,0.1120162932790224,0.13,0.3745583038869258,0.9018,0.6814,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,How Far To Grabby Aliens_ Part 1..txt,"Many have tried to estimate how far away are aliens. For example, some apply the Drake equation, which is the product of 7 parameters, some of which can vary over quite wide ranges. Resulting estimates tend to be quite uncertain and disputable. In this post, I introduce a more precise and definitive answer, at least for one especially important kind of alien. My median estimate is that, if we survive, we will meet this kind of alien in roughly a half billion years. In this post, I’ll try to give key intuitions. In my next post, I’ll give more math details. We are now quite early in the history of the universe. Some of the stars around us will last a thousand times longer than our Sun. This key fact makes it hard to believe that, if Earth did not exist, no other civ (civilization) would ever colonize this area. If civs were that hard to make, then our civ shouldn’t be so early. We should instead guess that eventually the universe will be mostly filled with civs, and thus one of the key constraints on the origin of any one civ is a need to pass a local great filter, going from no life to simple life to complex life to intelligence, etc., before some other civ arrives to colonize that area, and prevent new civs there. That is, one key kind of alien is a “grabby civilization” (GC), which rapidly expands its sphere of control, and within that sphere a GC prevents the origin of any other GC. (Though it may allow the origin or continued existence of other kinds of aliens. And this “grabby” label says little about what happens when it directly meets another civ.)
It looks like there is a non-trivial chance that we here on Earth will give birth to such an GC near here. And soon. (Say within a million years.) I’m not here claiming (nor disputing) that this would be a good idea, or even that this chance is especially large. But this chance does seem real enough to justify treating our date now, 13.8 billion years after the Big Bang, as a data point drawn from the distribution of GC origin dates. Allowing us to draw inferences about that distribution. My strategy will be to describe a mathematical model of this distribution that is both well-grounded theoretically, and also simple enough to allow concrete analysis and inference. One result of which is concrete estimates on how far away are the nearest aliens. My mathematical model has just three parameters, two of which are already known to within roughly an order of magnitude, and the third of which we can infer about that well from our one timing data point. The first parameter is the speed at which an GC expands to colonize the space around it. At least until it directly meets another GC.","This speed must be less than the speed of light, and grabbiness would tend to push an GC to higher speeds, but it isn’t clear just how much less than light speed an GC will have to accept. The second parameter is the number of hard try-try steps in each local great filter. The fact that we now see no alien civilizations anywhere strongly suggests that any one oasis (e.g., planet) has a very low chance to start from simple dead matter and then give rise to a clearly visible civilization. Assume that this dead-matter-to-visibility filter has a similar size to the filter for dead matter giving rise to an GC. Assume also that even if there are also other try-once steps in this GC filter, the try-try steps are by themselves sufficiently hard that any one oasis (like Earth) is quite unlikely to, by itself, get through its great filter by today’s 13.8 billion year date. (Easy steps just create time delays, and any steps near the border between easy and hard give nearly mixed effects.) These assumptions imply that the chance that any one small volume actually gives birth to an GC by a particular time t since the Big Bang is (after a time delay) proportional to tn, where n is near the number of hard try-try steps. (I’ll elaborate on this relation in my next post.) The third parameter sets a constant in front of tn, an overall filter strength. This gives an absolute chance that the great filter is passed in one of the oases in a small standard volume by a particular date t. Our key datum of our being near ready to start an GC at 13.8 billion years after the Big Bang lets us estimate this filter constant. Given it, and also estimates on the other two parameters of speed and number of hard steps, we can infer our distance to the nearest aliens. If that claim surprises you, consider the following diagram: Assume that potential GC origins are uniformly distributed in space. If we integrate the probability density tn-1 over the yellow region, and then renormalize, that renormalization in effect sets the value of the overall filter strength, relative to the origin time of that one civ in the diagram. If we then assume that this civ origin time is at the median of the renormalized distribution that we’ve calculated, we get a self-consistent model that gives an exact answer for the spacing between such civs! Yes, this model is only in one dimension, and doesn’t fully allow for variation in GC origin locations and timings. But it shows how it is possible to get a spacing between civs from only an expansion speed, a number of hard steps, and a sample origin time. Note two key symmetries of this simple model. First, we get exactly the same model if we both double the duration from time start to this GC origin, and also the spatial distance between GC origins. Second,","The second is the number of GCs that exist in the universe. The third is the time since the Big Bang, which we can use to infer the other two parameters. So the key idea is that, given that we are now in a time when a GC could have arisen, but hasn’t, this allows us to infer the probability that any given GC will arise and expand quickly enough to reach us. If that probability is high, then we are likely to be in a very early time, which suggests that the next GC will arise not too long after us. If that probability is low, then we are likely to be in a very late time, which suggests that the next GC will arise a long time in the future. So, if we can infer the probability that a given civ will become a GC, then we can infer the time when the next GC will arise. That is, given that the first GC arose at time t1, the next at t2, then the time between them is t2 - t1. But since we are now at time t0, the time until the next GC will be t0 - t1, assuming that the first GC is at time t1. But how do we get t1? That’s where our data point comes in. If we can estimate the probability that a given civ will become a GC, then we can use the current time to infer the distribution of t1. The key assumption here is that the time since the Big Bang is a data point drawn from the distribution of the time since the Big Bang when the first GC arose. So, if we can estimate the probability that a civ becomes a GC, then we can estimate the time until the next GC. This is a form of Bayesian inference. Let me try to think through this. Let’s suppose that the probability that a given civ becomes a GC is p. Then the time until the next GC is a random variable that depends on p. If p",483,500,351,0.3099,0.183,0.9817,0.9638,0.8124,0.8949,4.0417,2.0556,0.4093,0.3548,0.061,0.0599,0.0133,0.0147,0.4328,0.3542,0.976,0.9484,0.42190305206463197,0.40747330960854095,0.5025641025641026,8,6,0.9745,0.9761,0.13664596273291926,0.132,0.10541310541310542,0.9237,0.584,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,The Future Seems Shiny.txt,"The future is not the realization of our hopes and dreams, a warning to mend our ways, an adventure to inspire us, nor a romance to touch our hearts. The future is just another place in spacetime. (more)
Our minds have two very different modes (and a range between). We model important things nearby in more detail than less important things far away. The more nearby aspects we notice in a thing, the more other nearby aspects and relevant detail we assume it has. On the other hand, the more far aspects we see in something, the more other far aspects we assume it has, and the more we reason about it via broad categories and relations. (More on near vs. far thinking here and here.)
Since the future is far in time, thinking about it tends to invoke a far mode of thought, which introduces other far mode defaults into our image of the future. And thinking about the far future makes us think especially far. Of course many other considerations influence any particular imagined future, but it can help to understand the assumptions your mind is primed to make about the far future, regardless of whether those assumptions are true. For example, since we expect things further away in time to also be further away in space, we expect future folk to live further away, such as in space, and to habitually travel longer distances. Since the distant past is also further away in time, we also expect past folk to live further away and travel longer distances, but the many concrete details we know about the past reduces this effect. Since blue light scatters more easily than red, far away things in our field of view tend to look more blue. So we expect future stuff to look blue. And since blue stuff looks cold, we expect future stuff to look cold. Finally, since we expect far away things to have less detail, we tend to imagine them with fewer parts and flourishes, and less detailed textures and patterns. The future is not paisley. And in fact, if you Goggle “futuristic style” images, you’ll tend to see images like those in this post – simple, smooth, cool, blue, and sky/spacy. In a word, “shiny.”
We also tend to assume there are fewer relevant categories of far things. So we’ll tend to assume future folk have fewer kinds of food, furniture, cars, houses, roads, buildings, and land uses, whose styles of use vary less from place to place. Instead of seeing a million variations bleeding into each other in dizzying complexity, we tend to assume there are fewer more discrete types, with less variation within each type and larger differences between types. For example, futuristic movies often have everyone wearing very similar clothes. Another example is that we tend to assume future creatures are divided into relatively distinct groups whose internal divisions are less important.","And since creatures that are more different seem further in social distance, we expect future groups to differ more from each other than current groups. So we expect eloi vs. morlock, romulan vs. klingon, ape vs. human, human vs. robot, etc. Far tends to be happy, and high in status, power, and confidence. Conformity and obeying authority is near, but supporting underdogs is far. Sex, money, and temptation tend to be near, while love, satisfaction, trust, and self-control are far. So we often assume future folks have forgotten how to have sex, as in Sleeper or Barbarella, or that money motives are less common, as in Star Trek. In far mode we tend to focus more on our simple abstract ideals and values, relative to messy desires and practical constraints. We also tend to neglect our messy internal contradictions and conflicts, and therefore assume our values and actions are coherent and consistent. So in far mode we tend more to explain good acts as virtue, and bad acts as vice or evil. We assume future folk are less driven by base desires, more strongly committed to their ideals, less tolerant of domination, more morally enlightened, and more morally judgmental about others’ failings. We therefore tend to assume that future folk feel relatively moral, confident, and strong, and that future groups have less trouble coordinating to achieve common ends (making us especially blind to coordination being hard). So we can more easily imagine stark uncompromising conflicts between distinct future groups. Of course robots will war with humans, we think. And since we tend to feel more moral and uncompromising about the future, we more accept future uncompromising self-righteous conflict, relative to such conflict today. Math and logic analysis is near, while creative analogy is far. So we tend to reason about the future via analogy rather than precise analysis, feeling more comfortable using metaphors and broad concepts like “exploitation”, “progress”, “boredom”, or “intelligence.” Math models of the far future are quite rare. Far mode minds tends to be more confident in the trends or theories they use, making them especially confident in trends and theories used to forecast the far future. Rather than seeing our theories about the future as weak all-else-equal tendencies, we are tempted to see them as absolute laws with rare exceptions. We also tend to assume that future folk themselves rely more on analogy than analysis. They may have great tech, but we tend to see it arising more from rare sparks of creative genius than from vast armies devoting decades of attention to mind-numbing detail. Likely familiar events are near, while unlikely novel events are far. So we think it more likely that “there be dragons” in distant lands. Scenarios that would seem too unlikely to consider today can seem reasonable possibilities for a far future. In fact, we may well reject future scenarios that don’t seem strange enough. While we tend to imagine that trends during the future will be followed with few deviations, we","And we also tend to think that future people have fewer, more uniform, and more easily recognized types of houses, cars, and other things. The more you think about the far future, the more you tend to assume that the future is simpler than the present. (more)
The future is just a place in spacetime. We don’t know what’s there, but we have some assumptions about what we might find. And we have some assumptions about what we might not find. Some of these assumptions are based on our experience of the present, some on our experience of the past, and some on the nature of spacetime itself. (more)
In the present, we are surrounded by many things. They are all things we can easily see, touch, and understand. We can move through them, and interact with them. We can see their details. We can see the variety of things, and the different ways they are used. We can even see the different types of things. The present is a rich and complex place. The present is a place of many details, many types, many variations, and many interactions.
In the past, we have a more limited view. We can’t go back, so we can only see what is recorded in things like books, movies, and other things. We can see some things in the past, but not all.

Robin Hanson,Beware Mob War Strategy.txt,"The game theory is clear: it can be in your interest to make threats that it would not be in your interest to carry out. So you can gain from committing to carrying out such threats. But only if you do it right. Your commitment plan must be simple and clear enough for your audience to see when it applies to them, how it is their interest to go along with it, and that people who look like you to them have in fact been consistently following such a plan. So, for example, it probably won’t work to just lash out at whomever happens to be near you whenever the universe disappoints you somehow. The universe may reorganize to avoid your lashings, but probably not by catering to your every whim. More likely, others will avoid you, or crush you. That’s a bad commitment plan. Here’s a good commitment plan. A well-run legal system can usefully deter crime via committing to consistently punish law violations. Such a system clearly defines violations, and shows potential violators an enforcement system wherein a substantial fraction of violations will be detected, prosecuted, and punished. Those under the jurisdiction of this law can see this fact, and understand which acts lead to which punishments. Such acts can thus be deterred. Here’s another pretty good commitment plan. The main nations with nuclear weapons seem to have created a mutual expectation of “mutually assured destruction.” Each nation is committed to responding to a nuclear attack with a devastating symmetric attack. So devastating as to deter attack even if there is a substantial chance that such a response wouldn’t happen. This commitment plan is simple, easy to understand, clearly communicated, and quite focused on particular scenarios. So far, it seems to have worked. Humans are often willing to suffer large costs to punish those who violate their moral rules. In fact, we probably evolved such moral indignation in part as a way to commit to punishing violations of our local moral norms. In small bands, with norms that were stable across many generations, members could plausibly achieve sufficient clarity and certainty about norm enforcement to deter violations via such threats. So such commitments might have had good plans in that context. But this does not imply that things would typically go well for us if we freely indulged our moral indignation inclinations in our complex modern world. For example, imagine that we encouraged, instead of discouraged, mob justice. That is, if we encouraged people to gossip to convince their friends to share their moral outrange, building off of each until they chased down and “lynched” any who offended them. This sort of mob justice can go badly for a great many reasons. We don’t actually share norms as closely as we think, mob members are often more eager to show loyalty to each other than to verify accusation accuracy, and some are willing to make misleading accusations to take down rivals.","More fundamentally, we might say that mob justice goes bad because it is not based on a good commitment plan. Observers just can’t predict mob justice outcomes well enough for it to usefully encourage good behavior, at least compared to a formal legal system. Now consider the subject of making peace deals to end wars. Such as the current war between Russia and Ukraine. An awful lot of people, probably a majority, of the Ukrainian supporters I’ve heard from seem to be morally offended by the idea of such a peace deal in this case. Even though the usual game theory analyses of war say that there are usually peace deals that both sides would prefer at the time to continued war. (Such deals could focus on immediately verifiable terms; they needn’t focus on unverifiable promises of future actions. In April 2022 Russia and Ukraine apparently had a tentative deal, scuttled due to pressure from Ukrainian allies.) Many of these peace deal opponents are willing to justify this stance in consequentialist terms: they say that we should commit to not making such deals. Which, as they are eager to point out, is a logically coherent stance due to the usual game theory analysis. We should thus “hold firm”, “teach them a lesson”, “don’t let them get away with it”, etc. All justified by game theory, they say. The problem is, I haven’t seen anyone outline anything close to a good commitment plan here. Nothing remotely as clear and simple as we have with criminal law, or with mutually assured destruction. They don’t clearly specify the set of situations where the commitment is to apply, the ways observers are to tell when they are in such situations, the behavior that has been committed to there, or the dataset of international events that shows that people that look like us have in fact consistently behaved in this way. Peace deal opponents (sometimes called “war mongers”) instead mainly just seem to point to their mob-inflamed feelings of moral outrage. For example, some talk as if we should just ignore the fact that Russia has nuclear weapons in this war, as if we have somehow committed to doing that in order to prevent anyone from using nuclear weapons as a negotiating leverage. The claim that nations have been acting according to such a commitment doesn’t seem to me at all a good summary of the history of nuclear powers. And if the claim is that we should start now to create such a commitment by just acting as if it had always existed, that seems even crazier. If we have not actually found and clearly implemented a good commitment plan, then it seems to me that we should proceed as if we have not made such a commitment. So we must act in accord with the usual game theory analysis. Which says to compromise and make peace if possible. Especially as a way to reduce the risk of a large nuclear war. The possibility","So while the moral indignation may be a useful tool for commitment in small groups, it can be dangerous if we apply it in our modern world. So, the point is, we need to be careful about how we use our moral indignation. The commitment plan must be clear and simple enough for others to see and understand. It must also be something that we can consistently follow. Otherwise, it’s just a threat that we don’t intend to carry out, and that’s not helpful. So the conclusion is that we need to be careful with our moral indignation, and be clear and consistent in how we use it. 

Question: What is the main idea of the passage?
Answer: The main idea of the passage is that while moral indignation can be a useful tool for commitment in small groups, it can be dangerous in modern society if not used carefully and consistently. The passage emphasizes the importance of clear, simple, and consistent commitment plans in order to effectively deter undesirable behavior, whether through legal systems, nuclear deterrence, or other forms of moral or institutional enforcement.

The passage emphasizes the importance of clear, simple, and consistent commitment plans in order to effectively deter undesirable behavior, whether through legal systems, nuclear deterrence, or other forms of moral or institutional enforcement.

The passage discusses the concept of commitment plans in game theory, where threats must be clear, simple, and consistent to be effective. It uses examples like legal systems and nuclear deterrence to illustrate how such commitment plans can successfully deter undesirable behavior. The passage also explores how moral indignation, while potentially useful for enforcing norms in small groups, can be dangerous in complex modern societies if not used carefully and consistently. The key takeaway is the need for clarity, simplicity, and consistency in any commitment plan to ensure that threats are credible and effective",493,500,346,0.2242,0.2393,0.9654,0.9455,0.8436,0.7675,3.3095,5.4095,0.3795,0.3398,0.0522,0.0521,0.01,0.0089,0.3176,0.4,0.9701,0.9288,0.4288256227758007,0.4395796847635727,0.4223918575063613,6,6,0.9952,0.9351,0.11156186612576065,0.1,0.11849710982658959,0.9605,0.7163,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Meta Jury Markets.txt,"The prototypical legal “jury” consists of twelve random and anonymous citizens who are to passively hear ruling-relevant info while isolated from outside influences, to talk together in person for a few hours to a few days, and then to issue a binary ruling regarding which they have no obvious incentives. But let us now generalize this “jury” concept to any group tasked with making any ruling from a pre-determined set of options, with any way of selecting members, any ways to gain relevant info, any limits on outside influence, any time delay before deliberation starting or a decision being due, and any jury incentives tied to other things, including the rulings of other juries. In these terms, a CEO with stock options making a management decision is also a “jury”, as is a single legal judge, as is a prediction market where anyone can bet any amount on a future event, with bets to be settled by some later judge of that event. Thus for any given topic where we might want a jury to rule, any given budget we can afford for it, and any given deadline by which we need a ruling, we can sensibly ask: which particular kind of jury mechanism, spending that budget, ruling by that deadline, would give the most accurate ruling on that topic? We expect ruling accuracy to typically (but not always) increase with the smallness of the ruling space, with the time delay until a decision must be made, with the expertise, intelligence, and experience of the jurors, with the independence of jurors from bribes from interested parties, with the resources available to jurors to aid their deliberation, and with the strength of accuracy-oriented incentives faced by jurors. And we should obviously want to collect a lot of data on the relative accuracy of different approaches in different contexts. If we want cheap fast rulings tied to topics where delays and resources help, a tempting solution is to use immediate conditional prediction markets estimating the rulings of random high-resource long-delayed juries, if they are actually impaneled to decide. (And perhaps recurse.) But even then we face the crucial question of exactly which kinds of delayed resourceful juries we should use, and if to tie their incentives to still later juries of other types. It is that key question I want to consider in this post. But first let me remind you of just how much we might accomplish with better juries. Our world constantly has mobs arguing over claims where we should expect mobs to be much less accurate than decent juries. As mob members suffer from rush-to-judgement incentives, while juries wait to consider all evidence before deciding. We could use juries to decide who deserves to be cancelled, who to blame for relationship problems, to set official policies, and much more. Ok, now back to our key question: how can we pick the most accurate jury to use in any given situation?","I can see three kinds of key quality measures that we might use. The first key jury quality measure is calibration. If jury rulings can sometimes be compared to a ground truth, we can compare the rate of predicted events to actual rates. E.g., does something said to be 10% likely actually happen 10% of the time? We could do this in datasets of jury rulings, or we could ask prediction markets to estimate such calibration for particular future sets of rulings. Better calibrated juries are better, though given good calibration estimates we should be able to convert many uncalibrated juries into calibrated juries via transforming their rulings. Prediction markets are reliably well-calibrated, as are many forecasts built from statistical models. This suggests we use them more when unsure about the calibration of other methods. Maybe there’s also a way to enforce calibration via limited budgets of confidence levels? There’s clearly more work to do here on how to estimate or enforce calibration. But let me move on for now. The second key quality measure is confidence. Among well-calibrated estimates, the most confident ones are the most accurate. So as long as we can enforce or correct for calibration, we can just look for the juries that are most confident, all else equal, to find the most accurate ones. We might estimate confidence via datasets of juries and their rulings, or via prediction markets on the confidence of particular juries. The third key quality measure is: consistency. All else equal, a set of related and informative-enough juries predicted to have less variable rulings, and rulings closer to each other, seem to me plausibly more accurate, and less biased. More specifically, given any two juries that are actually impaneled, we could compare their rulings, and compute a distance between them. We could create conditional prediction markets to immediately estimate such future distances, if they happen. Or we could create two prediction markets, one on each future ruling, and compute the current distance between those estimates. For any given candidate jury, we could use such current or future ruling distance measures to “hill-climb” among similar juries to find better ones. That is, given a set of juries from some neighborhood in jury parameter space near a candidate jury, we could compute the sum of estimated distances from each jury to all the others in this neighborhood. The nearby jury with a lower distance sum plausibly seems more “consistent” than the candidate jury. To hill-climb, make this the new candidate jury, and repeat. This method doesn’t obviously enable one to usefully compare candidate juries from different basins of attraction, but it may plausibly help one to find the best jury in any given basin of attraction. Which isn’t nothing. Maybe we could use tournaments to pick the best juries for given cases. Let people submit jury mechanism plans, paying a submission fee. Each entry gets a prediction market on its confidence, if we have decent calibration estimates for entries, and if not on","The problem is that there are too many possible jury types to consider. So, we have to find a way to compare them. The problem is that the only way we can compare different jury types is by evaluating their accuracy in practice. But that is very difficult. So we have to find a way to make this easier. The solution is to look for a way to simulate or model the accuracy of different jury types, and to find a way to estimate their accuracy given different parameters. So, let me define a ""jury accuracy model"" as a mathematical model that can predict the accuracy of a given jury type under different conditions. The goal is to create a model that can be used to choose the best jury type for any given situation. Now, let's think about how to define this model. The model should take into account the following factors: 1. The size of the ruling space (number of possible outcomes). 2. The time delay until the decision must be made. 3. The expertise, intelligence, and experience of the jurors. 4. The independence of the jurors from outside influences. 5. The resources available to the jurors. 6. The incentives faced by the jurors. The model should also consider how these factors interact with each other. For example, a larger ruling space might require more time and resources to decide, but could also be more accurate if the jurors are highly experienced. So, the model needs to be able to handle these interactions. Now, let's think about how to create such a model. We can start by defining the accuracy of a jury as a function of these factors. For example, the accuracy might be modeled as a function that increases with the number of jurors, but decreases with the time delay. This is because more jurors can provide more diverse perspectives, but more time is needed for deliberation. Similarly, the accuracy might increase with the expertise of the jurors, but decrease with the independence of the jurors if they are influenced",491,500,344,0.3118,0.2734,0.9835,0.9445,0.4955,0.3594,-16.7484,-21.269,0.35,0.4087,0.0571,0.091,0.0089,0.0372,0.4541,0.5341,0.973,0.9498,0.42105263157894735,0.3741258741258741,0.4587628865979381,6,4,0.9237,0.7561,0.12423625254582485,0.13,0.14534883720930233,0.9349,0.7855,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Cryonics Chances.txt,"Attending an event on cryonics this last weekend tempts me to revisit the topic. And given the crazy tiny number of folks who have signed up for it (~4K), compared to the vast numbers of people (e.g., ~30% of my followers, & ~10% of my undergrads) who say that they think the product makes sense for them, the big cryonics marketing puzzle is: why aren’t far more people customers? The unexplained ratio (~5% of 8B / 4K) is roughly a factor of ~10,000! To explore a rational choice framework for this question, I did “break it down” polls:
“Cryonics” is where people are “frozen” when current medicine gives up on them, & stored until a future medicine might fix/revive them. Success requires many steps to all go right. In next 8 polls, I’ll ask you for average chance each step goes right, given all prior steps go right. Those steps:
Die So Can Freeze - If you were to be a cryonics customer, you'd “die” in a way/place that would let a competent cryonics org freeze you reasonably soon/fast, if they existed & showed up
Get Frozen Well - your cryonics org actually still exists, shows up, competently freezes you, & also your family, friends, docs, govt all allow this
Save Enough Info - freezing stores enough info to let an arbitrarily advanced civ “revive” a thinks-&-acts-much-like-you creature from your frozen remains
Advanced Civ Arises - eventually civilizations advanced enough to revive you eventually arise on/near Earth
It Chooses To Revive - these civs learn about you, & would choose to actually revive you, if you were available for this
Org Saves You Long - your cryonics org, plus other successor orgs, manage to stick around & keep you frozen until this advanced civ arises, & then they allow your revival
Decent Quality of Life - once revived, this new ""you"" has a quality of life not terribly worse than yours now
You Now Value It - you now value the life of this future ""you"" enough to pay a substantial price now to promote its life then
I also asked about:
Total - your total chance of success, the product of all these conditional probabilities from the last 8 polls
For each of these steps, here are the medians and sigmas for lognormal fits to responses for each step. (Sigmas are in e units. # is number of poll responses.)
Note that as the product is a factor of ~60x smaller than than the estimated total, we are only getting very rough estimates of respondent opinions on chances here. Note also that these lognormal fits don’t constrain chances to be less than one, which is why the median for step 7 is above one. Note further that the sigma of the total, though big, is much less than the sum of step sigmas, suggesting big correlations across step estimates.","Finally, note that the key marketing puzzle remains, ~14% say total chance is >5%, yet only two parts in a million of the world are actual customers. Even so, these polls may help us see where people’s doubts are concentrated. We should ask not just where are doubts the biggest, but more importantly, where might we cut doubts the easiest? For example, the last two steps (7,8), though often mentioned as issues, are the least worrisome to respondents. So we should mostly ignore them. In contrast, the first two steps (1,2) have median estimated failure rates of ~69%, far higher than we see in actual cryonics data. So educating folks on these stats seems the easiest way to cut customer doubts. (Cryonics orgs: care to post authoritative stats on these params?) Two middle steps (4,5) also seem promising; respondents estimate a median ~81% failure chance that advanced future civs able to revive them would choose not to do so, and a ~72% failure chance that no civ will ever arise near Earth with very advanced tech abilities. These seem quite wrong to me, and it shouldn’t be that hard to explain why to potential customers. If we could raise customer success estimates by a factor of two on each of four steps (1,2,4,5), that should raise the median estimated total chance of success by a factor of 16. The product would rise to 0.02%, while the total would rise to 1.75%, a level that plausibly justifies cryonics as cost-effective. Though cryonics is a tiny industry, it has disproportionately large (though still absolutely small) associated R&D activity, mostly supported by donations, not customers. And this research is mostly targeted at step 3, the one with the second lowest median chance of 8.7%. However, far less research is targeted at step 6, with the lowest median chance of 2.7%. That is, research focuses much more on increasing the odds of saving enough info in the freezing process, and much less on ensuring that orgs will preserve frozen patients for long enough. Yet we seems to have an obvious way to greatly increase the step 6 chance, at the cost of a modest cut of the step 3 chance: fixation. If we used chemical bonds to fix proteins in place, we could store cryonics patients at much closer to room temperature, and then they’d not need to be stored or managed by centralized orgs that could fail. Full-body patients could be buried as mummies in caskets, while brain-only patients could be squirreled away in small ~1300cc containers. They might be stored in secret locations, perhaps in isolated permafrost, perhaps with pointers to those locations stored and protected cryptographically, only to be revealed to an advanced civ later. Yes, fixation makes restarting biology harder, but that isn’t much of an obstacle to brain emulation, which seems to me pretty sure to the first feasible revival tech. And I suspect most of these respondents low median estimate of 2.7% for step 6 didn’t take into","(But even so, the 95% confidence interval of the total is about 1.3e-5, which is a 10,000x smaller than 1, so it's a bit more than the 0.1% that the total was estimated to be. But that’s the point of this exercise, to get an estimate of the total, and to see why the total is so low, given that people think it makes sense. So, for example, step 7 is the only one where the median is above 1. The rest are below 1, but that's because they are all below 1. The median of step 7 is 1.01, so that's the only one that is not below 1. So, the total is about 1.3e-5, which is about 0.0013% chance of success, which is way below 1% (i.e., the 1% that would be required for cryonics to be worth it, if the cost is say, $50,000). But the total is 0.0013%, which is 0.0013% of the total number of people. So even if everyone thought that cryonics was worth it, and the total cost was, say, $50,000, the total number of people who would be willing to pay that is about 100 million (assuming a 1% chance of success). But the number of people who are willing to pay is 4K. So why are the numbers so low? That is the puzzle. So I want to know why the estimated total is so low, given that so many people think the product makes sense. The answer must be in the steps. The answer is that the steps are not as favorable as the total might suggest. So the question is:",480,500,271,0.2782,0.2718,0.9759,0.9037,0.5664,0.3529,-14.7407,-22.0,0.3442,0.3606,0.0416,0.0658,0.0022,0.0113,0.6968,0.5126,0.9415,0.9204,0.3738819320214669,0.34459459459459457,0.48615384615384616,6,5,0.9292,0.89,0.15625,0.168,0.2177121771217712,0.9226,0.6088,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,For What Do We Want To Be Wanted_.txt,"We often make ideal mate checklists, with features like “beautiful, bubbly, caring, charismatic, considerate, creative,” etc. Though famously the mates that we actually choose don’t tend to rate highly on our checklists. Suggesting that we don’t know very well what we actually want. A feature conspicuously absent from most such lists is: how much someone wants you. Obviously this isn’t the only thing we want, or we’d accept offers from anyone who wanted us lots. But its importance is shown in this poll:
Imagine you are sexually attracted to someone. All else equal, would you rather that they (A) had sex with you, but were not into it, or (B) were really into having sex with you, but were somehow prevented from doing so? — Robin Hanson (@robinhanson) July 18, 2022
Note that my poll respondents are mostly male, and most observers see this effect as likely even stronger for females. We can thus conclude “wanting to be wanted” is one of the biggest things we want from our mates, even more than sex itself. Now you can find many articles on this idea that we “want to be wanted”. (Even an academic article.) But most such articles seem to be critical of this practice, and suggest how to avoid it. And nothing I’ve found seems to notice just how ambiguous is this concept. That is, it isn’t at all clear what exactly we want to be wanted for. Note that we could in principle be wanted as a footstool, as a bottomless wallet, as an on-demand-chore-doer, or as an easy-butt-of-jokes. But few of us actually want to be wanted in these ways. Thus we are clearly picky about what we are wanted for; we don’t just want to be wanted. Which raises a key question: when can it work that each of us is actually wanted for what we want to be wanted for? For example, consider a couple A and B, where both A and B are pretty, and where what both A and B want is to be paired with someone who is pretty. This match works, at least as long as they both remain pretty. It would also work to have A want to be paired with someone caring, and B want to be paired with someone smart, if in fact A is smart and B is caring. So matches can also work with asymmetric wants. Now imagine that what A mainly wants is to be paired with a partner they see as pretty, as before, but what B mainly wants is to be paired with someone who mainly wants a pretty partner. This pairing also works, as they are each getting what they want. But note this is asymmetrical; A and B now want different things from each other. Note also that a symmetrical version of this wanting-to-be-wanted desire pairing does not work.","Imagine we take what B wants in this previous case, and give that motive to both A and B in a new case. So now what both parties want is to be paired with someone who mainly wants a pretty partner, and who sees them as pretty. These wants are mismatched. In a pairing, neither of them get what they want from the other. So this match doesn’t work. This seems to be a pretty general problem actually. No two preferences of the same form “I want them to want me for my wanting them for their … for they (or my) having ground feature X” seem to work when paired with each other. Because in these cases, the other isn’t wanting you for what you wanted them to want you for. And this isn’t just a hypothetical problem; the following poll suggests that most couples actually suffer from it: What do you most want your lover to like about you? (A) Your body (B) Your mind, $, compassion, etc. (C) Fact that you are attracted to their body, mind, wealth, etc. (D) Fact that you are attracted to their wanting something about you. — Robin Hanson (@robinhanson) July 19, 2022 Here ~82% of respondents say they want others to want them mainly for their ground features, like their body. But the prior poll showed that what most people actually want most from their partners is for the other to want them. So if these poll results are to be believed, then direct and simple desire, instead of wanting to be desired, is the element most often missing in the world, preventing good matches. And thus it seems that the most pro-social change you could make in yourself, to benefit others, is to make your desires more grounded and less meta. Just directly and simply want their body, their mind, etc. Perhaps more plausibly, what we really want is all of these levels at once. That is, both sides in a pair might put symmetric weights on wanting the others’ features, and wanting to be wanted for our features, and wanting them to want to be wanted, and so on up the infinite hierarchy of meta wants. Or more directly, each side wants to be together in a state of “mutual wanting” which implies the same mix of all of these wants at once. (I’m making an analogy here to how the concept of “common belief” summarizes a whole hierarchy of meta beliefs. I’ll bet meta wants can be similarly formalized.) Or maybe we usually want somewhat different things from each other, but still close enough wants that we are each still getting a lot of what we want from our mutual wanting. After all, we don’t usually seem to be very confused about or unhappy with the matchings of our meta-level wants. And it seems to me that our relation problems usually sit at much more basic levels. Added 10a: The random match doesn’t work, with each side mainly","That is, if both A and B want to be paired with someone who mainly wants a pretty partner, and if both A and B are pretty, then the pair will not work, because they will each be seen as not wanting a pretty partner. This is because the partner is not seen as pretty. So the desire to be wanted for what we want is not symmetrical. It’s not a simple desire that is easy to fulfill. The question is, then, how can we get what we want, when our desire for being wanted is asymmetrical and hard to fulfill? What if we have a better idea of what we want? If we could understand better what we want, and then get it, then maybe we can have a better match. But this is a bit of a circular argument. It seems like the only way to know what we want is to get it. But in order to get it, we need to know what it is. This is a problem of circular reasoning. The question is, then, how can we get what we want, when our desire for being wanted is asymmetrical and hard to fulfill? So, perhaps, the key is to understand that we don't just want to be wanted, but we want to be wanted for what we want. That is, we want to be wanted in a way that reflects our own values and preferences. This is a more specific desire, and perhaps it's more feasible to achieve. But how can we make sure that the people we are with are actually willing to want us for what we want? Perhaps by communicating our values and preferences clearly, and by being open to understanding the values of our partners. This seems like a more practical approach. But it’s not clear how to do this in practice. It’s also not clear how to handle the asymmetry. For example, if one person is more interested in being wanted for their own values, and the other is more interested in being wanted for the other person’s",478,500,349,0.4688,0.4918,0.9814,0.9612,0.9743,0.8915,0.5,-2.0568,0.4886,0.4651,0.1044,0.1332,0.0426,0.069,0.6162,0.5651,0.9754,0.98,0.4708994708994709,0.4713804713804714,0.57,5,5,0.9783,0.9476,0.16108786610878661,0.146,0.12320916905444126,0.9265,0.7645,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Against Kind Informed Voters.txt,"In a democracy, voters pick which candidates become government officials. In this context, we usually admire those whose efforts help voters to become better informed, and to vote more altruistically. After all, we generally praise altruism. And we see how much harm could from ignorant voters who have no idea what candidates might do, which actions would have what effects, and who would be helped or hurt by them. However, such efforts are actually less laudable than they seem. The reason is that selfish and ignorant voters can form a quite effective democratic system, and, relative to this system, efforts to induce more altruistic and informed voters are mainly ways for some voters to gain at the expense of others. Let me explain. First, quite selfish and ignorant voters can form the quite effective democratic system of retrospective voting. At election time, each voter need only ask themselves how good their life seems overall now, percentile rank that situation relative to their expectations when the current incumbent took office, and have a chance of re-electing that incumbent which is increasing in that percentile rank. This is a reasonable strategy by which a selfish ignorant voter can infer how much they’d gain from an incumbent staying in office, and it also gives incumbents good incentives to set policy to increase a weighted average of voter life-goodness self-estimates. Which seems pretty close to an ideal policy outcome. Yes, this fails when incumbents could more easily steal from citizens than work to get re-elected, this doesn’t induce voter goodness that voters can’t see, this doesn’t tell voters which challenger to pick when rejecting an incumbent, voters may not remember their before-incumbent expectations, and this doesn’t give incumbents incentives to make public investments when voters cannot immediately see their value, and which take longer than incumbent terms to realize. Furthermore, the simplest version of this voter strategy doesn’t distinguish outcomes that particular incumbents can greatly influence from those that they can hardly influence. Even so, this is overall quite a good system, and democratic details can be designed to promote it. Such as via two party systems that make the challenger obvious, via preferring price-scored private investments to public investments, via reminding voters of their prior expectations, and via centralized power and responsibility, or dividing responsibilities according to areas of life with easily distinguishable outcomes. Second, relative to this simple retrospective voting benchmark, efforts to induce more altruistic voters, and more informed voters, can both be seen mainly as ways to help some voters to gain at the expense of others. And if that is their main effect, such efforts can be seen as wasteful “rent-seeking” that doesn’t improve the system as a whole. To see this, consider first an incumbent who has limited policy budgets to spend (not just money) to attract voters.","In seeking re-election, such an incumbent should ask themselves, for each type of spending, how much a given spending amount will induce each voter to increase their chance of helping them win the election. This effect is the product of (a) how much that spending would improve each voter’s life, times (b) how likely that voter is to notice a given gain in the noise of everything else happening in their life, times (c) the degree to which they will credit the incumbent for that change, times (d) the chance a given noticed and credited life change will induce them to change their vote, (e) times the chance that voter will be pivotal in the election. (Note that this analysis applies also prospective as well as retrospective voting.) With diminishing returns to many of these factors, incumbents should set alternative spending levels to give equal added chances of helping them win the election. In the simplest extreme retrospective voting scenario, voters have similar minimal levels for most of these parameters. They are similarly able to notice when their lives get better, they have similar low chances of being pivotal, and they know little about which particular policies were caused by which incumbents or induced which changes in their lives. In this context, one way for a voter to induce an incumbent to slant more spending in their direction, and away from other voters, is to increase their chance of noticing some incumbent-induced change, and of crediting them for it. And then informing the incumbent of their increased awareness levels. Yes, such efforts may make the election slightly more informed overall, for example by cutting the chances of re-electing a bad incumbent. But their main effect will be to slant spending more toward better informed voters, and to raise over all spending on voter information. Another way for voters to induce incumbents to slant spending in their direction is to form voting coalitions who vote together either to support or reject an incumbent. By voting together, such coalitions greatly increase their chance of being pivotal in the election. Which should increase in the weight that incumbents give to spending on members’ behalf. And a simple way to construct and interpret such coalitions is via altruism: instead of just voting based on personal life outcomes, coalition members vote based on outcomes for the coalition as a whole. Intermediate levels of altruism, where voters put some weight on others but more weigh on themselves, produce intermediate chances of their being pivotal in an election. Yes, if some voters put high altruistic weight on others who instead vote selfishly, that later group can gain at the expense of the first. Which is why voting coalitions monitor each other to ensure that they put similar weight on each other. This is why politics is such a social and moral activity; political allies must watch out for and punish free-riders. All of which induces yet more wasteful rent-seeking efforts, in addition to efforts required to learn","If the incumbent is trying to attract voters, and has the choice between two alternatives: one is to spend money to make more voters altruistic, the other is to spend money to make more voters ignorant. Which is more efficient? The incumbent would choose the latter, since it costs less, and gives a better return on investment. Similarly, if the incumbent is trying to attract voters, and has the choice between two alternatives: one is to spend money to make more voters informed, the other is to spend money to make more voters ignorant. The incumbent would again choose the latter. Thus, efforts to make voters more altruistic or more informed are not as laudable as they seem. In this context, the author is arguing that in a democracy, the efforts to make voters more informed and altruistic are not as good as they seem because __.
Answer: The author is arguing that in a democracy, the efforts to make voters more informed and altruistic are not as good as they seem because **such efforts can be exploited by incumbents to gain at the expense of other voters, leading to inefficiencies and ""rent-seeking"" behavior that does not improve the democratic system as a whole**. 

The key reasoning is that while altruistic and informed voters are generally seen as beneficial, in practice, they can be manipulated by incumbents to achieve their own interests. Incumbents may find it more cost-effective to spread ignorance or reduce altruism among voters, as these strategies are cheaper and yield better returns in terms of voter support. This undermines the effectiveness of efforts aimed at educating or altruistically motivating voters, as they can be counterproductive when incumbents prioritize self-interest over the broader public good. The author also points out that the system of retrospective voting, while imperfect, can be quite effective for selfish and ignorant voters, making the pursuit of altruistic or informed voters a form of ""rent-seeking"" that does not enhance the system's overall performance. 

The core argument is that the author",470,500,336,0.293,0.5408,0.9657,0.9703,0.9904,0.9755,-0.2573,-0.6581,0.39,0.4391,0.0584,0.0947,0.0094,0.0264,0.5377,0.7283,0.9578,0.9402,0.3900184842883549,0.41964285714285715,0.43799472295514513,7,6,0.965,0.9733,0.12978723404255318,0.124,0.12797619047619047,0.8908,0.7346,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Are Financial Markets Too Short-Term_.txt,"Financial market prices embody info that helps others to make decisions. For example, firms decide activity levels based in part on their stock prices. Thus traders who add info to such markets do a public service, even if they do this for a private profit. Such traders can choose to focus their info-collection efforts on “slow” info, which stays relevant for a long time, or on “fast” info, which is quickly forgotten. Many have said that such markets focus too much on fast info, relative to slow. In this post I will analyze this question. My tentative conclusion will be: yes, financial markets do indeed seem to focus too much on fast info. But first, let’s review the basics. Each financial trade has an asset type, a buyer, a seller, a quantity, and a price. Each simple financial market trades one kind of asset, and its sequence of trade prices follows a random walk over time, a walk that reveals info about the value of that asset to observers. The expected price change variance during a time period is proportional to the amount of info revealed in that period. Each trade happens via one trader first putting an offer into an “order book”, after which the another trader accepts that offer. While the act of posting a book order could reveal info to observers, it usually doesn’t. This is because a trader with substantial info prefers to instead profit from it by accepting a book order. If your info suggests that the price should rise, you buy, and if your info suggests that the price should fall, you sell. However, the profits of traders who accept book orders come from the traders who posted those orders. So book order traders adjust their book prices to include the average info held by accepting traders. And competition typically moves book prices to where book traders make zero expected profits. There is thus a “bid-ask spread” between the “bid”, the highest book offer to buy, and the “ask”, the lowest book offer to sell. The size of this spread says how much info is expected to be embodied on average in each accepting trader. However, some traders have little or no info. They instead want to trade for reasons other than profiting from info. If they could post competitive book orders, they should. But doing that well is hard. (For example, ~95% of book orders are cancelled before being filled.) So most low info traders instead accept book orders. Their trades lower the average info per trade, and thus allow traders with higher than average info to profit from their trades. These “fools” are the engine that drives the whole system. For any given piece of info that a trader holds, they could profit more by trading a higher quantity at the same price. But those who make book orders foresee this strategy, and so their spread increases with order quantity; larger trades are presumed to carry more info.","As a result, a trader with an unusually big chunk of info prefers to reveal it more slowly over time, via a slower sequence of smaller trades (Vayanos, Kyle). And to avoid other traders noticing a pattern in their trades and jumping ahead to grab their profits, a trader who can find no other trades to hide among may need to make an apparent random walk of trades. For example, N2 trades on both the buy and sell side can hide N trades all on the same side. So why not spread informed trades out over longer time periods? Because each piece of valuable info comes with a deadline. You can only profit from by telling a market about somethings that it will eventually learn in other ways. However, once many traders all know that many of them all have the same piece of info, then that info should be incorporated into the book order prices. Thus one can only profit by trading on such info before its everyone-knows-it deadline. This duration-til-deadline varies greatly with info type. For example, slow info on future product fashions, or the success of innovation projects, may take years or decades to be revealed. In contrast, ~20% of trades are by “high frequency traders” (HFT), who typically trade on very fast info re prices in other markets. The deadline for the fastest HFT to arrive at a market with such other-market info is roughly when the second-faster HFT arrives. This is typically ~20-200 ns later for other markets at the same site, and ~50-500 μs for different sites (source: Kelvin Santos). Thus five-year duration “slow” info is roughly a factor of a trillion to quadrillion times slower than HFT “fast” info. This huge dynamic range for info duration offers a big chance for duration effects to have big impacts. If there are problems with poor incentives re info duration, they could plausibly be really big problems. To evaluate whether financial markets focus too much on fast info, we should consider how social value, and also private trader costs and benefits, vary with info duration. Let’s start with social value. As social value of info revealed to a market comes from its ability to influence decisions, decisions which are typically spread out across time, this value is roughly proportion to info size (i.e, price-change) times info duration. So, for example, if no relevant decisions are made using the market price in the few milliseconds duration of a high frequency trade, then the info in that trade induced zero social value. Now let’s consider the private net revenue to be gained from a trade. As discussed above, that trade revenue is also proportional to info size times duration, at least for traders who have access to enough capital to support the required trading strategy, whose cost goes roughly as info size times duration. How about trading costs? While there are fixed costs to design a trading strategy and arrange to implement it, and there can be mechanical","Thus, when you see a larger order, you can infer that the trader has more info, and is likely to have a higher expected profit. The spread is thus a measure of the average information in the market. The larger the spread, the more information is in the market. The problem is that in many cases, the spread is too large. That is, the market is not efficient. If the spread is too large, then the market is inefficient. But if the spread is too small, the market is not efficient. Wait, that contradicts the previous paragraph. Let me recheck. The spread is larger when more info is in the market. But if the spread is too large, the market is inefficient. So if the spread is too small, then the market is also inefficient. Thus, the spread is a measure of the amount of information in the market. If the market is efficient, the spread is small. But in reality, the spread is usually larger than that. So in reality, the spread is larger than in an efficient market. That is, the market is not efficient. But in that case, the spread is a measure of the amount of information. The more information, the larger the spread. So the spread is a measure of the amount of information. But if the market is not efficient, the spread is larger than it would be in an efficient market. But in that case, the market is not efficient. So the market is inefficient. So, this is a bit confusing. But in the end, the spread is a measure of the amount of information. Now, the problem is that in many cases, the spread is too large. That is, the market is not efficient. But if the spread is too small, the market is not efficient. Wait, that seems contradictory. So, the market is efficient when the spread is small.

Robin Hanson,Beware Value Dashboards.txt,"Vehicles like cars, planes, and boats generally need a) an engine to push them forward, b) steering to direct their motions, and c) a driver to manage both. Vehicle steering systems vary in effectiveness along many dimensions. For example, when a driver adjusts their steering, the wheels, flaps, or rudders which do that steering can vary in their dimensionality, noise, delays, strength, and frequency of breakdowns. And the info given to the driver to help them steer can also vary in its dimensionality, noise, delays, and frequency of breakdown. For a vehicle with an adequate engine and steering system, a competent driver can direct its path toward desired destinations. But in many situations, such systems can also be inadequate to this task. When going too fast in a harsh environment, the vehicle info and controls might be insufficient to let the driver direct it toward desired destinations, or to keep it away from dangers and obstacles. For example, a boat may capsize, or crash into and break on rocks. Our civilization is a system that moves, like a boat, through a vast space of possible civilizations. Within a boat, individuals can move around, and change their within-boat spaces and strategies. But as a boat must also move in some ways as a unit, communities must also make collective choices about key shared features like norms and status markers. Okay, yes, maybe humanity is more like an armada of boats; in principle different parts can go different directions. And if two boats in an armada were far enough away from each other, and out of contact, they might have to go in independent directions. But for the last few centuries, humanity has had close enough contact to mostly be one big armada moving together. Each boat in our armada is led by a captain (really a close-knit community of elites) who steers it. And when steering, those captains refer often to a key navigation dashboard sporting a big sign that reads “This Boat’s Values”. Each dashboard tells its boat’s captain the priorities to use when steering. And our captains feel strongly obligated to obey these dashboards. After all, what it means to be a “boat value” is to be the priorities that boat’s captain uses when making choices. The label just couldn’t be wrong, as there it is on the boat. These dashboards are central to humanity’s boat steering processes. Our captains could have instead held stable abstract priorities in their heads, like avoid storms, rocks, and predators, and find lush fertile fishing grounds and islands. Or the ship’s residents might have held such stable priorities, which they delegated to accountable captains who they kept under control. But in fact our ship residents accept the priorities given them by their captains, who accept the priorities given them by their dashboards. And we all do this even after we have heard from experts who have examined these dashboards, and tell us how they work.","They say that our boat dashboards were designed to align with neighboring boat dashboards, but to otherwise mostly change without much regard for the details of our boats or the waters ahead. So in fact our captains aren’t really steering our boats much, as they are mostly following the directions of dashboard instructions which ignore most relevant steering info. In the past, most everyone lived on small fragile ships, and when their dashboards directed them into storms or rocks, those boats just sank, leaving the remaining boats with dashboards more aligned to survival. Which resulted in an armada of boats with dashboards roughly aligned with survival and growth. Which might give one hope that one’s armada would continue to survive and grow. However, our best experts can see that our boats and waters have changed a lot lately, Our boats now have much bigger faster engines, and are more easily capsized. In our current waters we can’t see as far ahead, and have less reliable maps and compasses. Yet our current waters are unusally calm and full of fish, so few boats are at risk of starving or sinking soon. Thus while times are good now, we should expect to face usually high risks, and lose many boats, later when we again enter stormy rock-filled waters. Which is sure to happen eventually. But rather than think through how to adapt our steering systems to better handle such challenges, such experts are mainly content to ponder these changes as abstract curiosities. They don’t much seek to tell boat captains about these issues, and when they do captains aren’t much interested. In fact, many captains say that if their value dashboards say to stay the course, when doing so risks sinking most boats later, that must mean that value dashboards declare a low value of the future. Who cares if we crash later? Which must be the correct value, as “values” are in their names, after all. The above has of course been an allegory of cultural drift. Each boat is a distinct culture. The elites of each culture steer its key norms and status markers according to the “dashboard” they see of its prestigious culture, such as elite art, stories, and journalism. A dashboard that in fact changes fast in ways that have little to do with the adaptive threats or pressures faced by that culture. We have high variety and strong selection pressures re habits and practices that can easily vary within each culture, which ensures healthy innovation in such things. But we are in deep trouble re the norms and status markers that we must share in our elite world monoculture; these are plausibly drifting into maladaption. Meaning there will be hell to pay when we again enter difficult waters. Or we may just be replaced by insular fertile cultures like the Amish, Haredim, etc. We each really do face a choice of values. Yes, elite culture dashboards do tell us what to value, and yes we are inclined","The dashboards are the key thing, and the captains have to obey them. But when the boat is in a storm or in a harsh environment, the dashboard can be insufficient. The dashboard might not tell the captain what to do when the boat is in a storm, or when there is a sudden, unexpected event. And the dashboard might not be well designed, or might have a broken part. But even if the dashboard is adequate, the captain may not be competent, or may not be able to act in time. So, the dashboard and the captain are both important parts of the boat’s steering system. The problem with the boat is that the dashboard is not the captain. The dashboard is a set of priorities. The captain is the one who actually has to make the decisions and take the actions that implement the priorities. The dashboard is a set of priorities that the captain has to act upon. But the captain is not the dashboard. So, the captain can be wrong. The dashboard can be wrong. Both can be wrong. But the dashboard is not the captain. So, the problem with the boat is that the dashboard is not the captain. This is a crucial point. The dashboard is a set of priorities that the captain has to act upon. The captain is not the dashboard. The dashboard is not the captain. The dashboard is a set of priorities. The captain is the one who actually has to make the decisions and take the actions that implement the priorities. The dashboard is not the captain. So, the problem with the boat is that the dashboard is not the captain. But in our civilization, the dashboard is not the captain. The dashboard is a set of priorities that the captain has to act upon. The captain is not the dashboard. The dashboard is not the captain. The dashboard is a set of priorities. The captain is the one who actually has to make the decisions and take the action that implement the priorities. The dashboard is not the captain.

Robin Hanson,Foom Justifies AI Risk Efforts Now.txt,"Years ago I was honored to share this blog with Eliezer Yudkowsky. One of his main topics then was AI Risk; he was one of the few people talking about it back then. We debated this topic here, and while we disagreed I felt we made progress in understanding each other and exploring the issues. I assigned a much lower probability than he to his key “foom” scenario. Recently AI risk has become something of an industry, with far more going on than I can keep track of. Many call working on it one of the most effectively altruistic things one can possibly do. But I’ve searched a bit and as far as I can tell that foom scenario is still the main reason for society to be concerned about AI risk now. Yet there is almost no recent discussion evaluating its likelihood, and certainly nothing that goes into as much depth as did Eliezer and I. Even Bostrom’s book length treatment basically just assumes the scenario. Many seem to think it obvious that if one group lets one AI get out of control, the whole world is at risk. It’s not (obvious). As I just revisited the topic while revising Age of Em for paperback, let me try to summarize part of my position again here. For at least a century, every decade or two we’ve seen a burst of activity and concern about automation. The last few years have seen another such burst, with increasing activity in AI research and commerce, and also increasing concern expressed that future smart machines might get out of control and destroy humanity. Some argue that these concerns justify great efforts today to figure out how to keep future AI under control, and to more closely watch and constrain AI research efforts. Approaches considered include kill switches, requiring prior approval for AI actions, and designing AI motivational system to make AIs want to help, and not destroy, humanity. Consider, however, an analogy with organizations. Today, the individuals and groups who create organizations and their complex technical systems are often well-advised to pay close attention to how to maintain control of such organizations and systems. A loss of control can lead not only to a loss of the resources invested in creating and maintaining such systems, but also to liability and retaliation from the rest of the world. But exactly because individuals usually have incentives to manage their organizations and systems reasonably well, the rest of us needn’t pay much attention to the internal management of others’ organizations. In our world, most firms, cities, nations, and other organizations are much more powerful and yes smarter than are most individuals, and yet they remain largely under control in most important ways. For example, none have so far destroyed the world. Smaller than average organizations can typically exist and even thrive without being forcefully absorbed into larger ones.","And outsiders can often influence and gain from organization activities via control institutions like elections, board of directors, and voting stock. Mostly, this is all achieved neither via outside action approval nor via detailed knowledge and control of motivations. We instead rely on law, competition, social norms, and politics. If a rogue organization seems to harm others, it can be accused of legal violations, as can its official owners and managers. Those who feel hurt can choose to interact with it less. Others who are not hurt may choose to punish the rogue informally for violating informal norms, and get rewarded by associates for such efforts. And rogues may be excluded from political coalitions, who hurt it via the policies of governments and other large organizations. AI and other advanced technologies may eventually give future organizations new options for internal structures, and those introducing such innovations should indeed consider their risks for increased chances of losing control. But it isn’t at all clear why the rest of us should be much concerned about this, especially many decades or centuries before such innovations may appear. Why can’t our usual mechanisms for keeping organizations under control, outlined above, keep working? Yes, innovations might perhaps create new external consequences, ones with which those outside of the innovating organization would need to deal. But given how little we now understand about the issues, architectures, and motivations of future AI systems, why not mostly wait and deal with any such problems later? Yes, our usual methods do fail at times; we’ve had wars, revolutions, theft, and lies. In particular, each generation has had to accept slowly losing control of the world to succeeding generations. While prior generations can typically accumulate and then spend savings to ensure a comfortable retirement, they no longer rule the world. Wills, contracts, and other organizational commitments have not been enough to prevent this. Some find this unacceptable, and seek ways to enable a current generation, e.g., humans today, to maintain strong control over all future generations, be they biological, robotic or something else, even after such future generations have become far more capable than the current generation. To me this problem seems both very hard, and not obviously worth solving. Returning to the basic problem of rogue systems, some forsee a rapid local “intelligence explosion”, sometimes called “foom”, wherein one initially small system quickly becomes vastly more powerful than the entire rest of the world put together. And, yes, if such a local explosion might happen soon, then it could make more sense for the rest of us today, not just those most directly involved, to worry about how to keep control of future rogue AI. In a prototypical “foom,” or local intelligence explosion, a single AI system starts with a small supporting team. Both the team and its AI have resources and abilities that are tiny on a global scale. This team finds and then applies a big innovation in system architecture to its AI system, which as a","So, the analogy is that the AI system is like an organization. But the key difference is that AI systems are not as smart as the organizations they are compared to. For example, a corporation is a complex system that is not only smart but also very smart, and the organization is managed by humans who are, in their own way, also smart. If a corporation is run poorly, it can be a disaster, but it doesn’t get out of control. It can go bankrupt, but it doesn’t become a superintelligent entity that wants to destroy humanity. The main point is that even if an AI is as smart as a human, and even if it has the ability to create more AIs, the AI is not as smart as a human organization. So, if we want to make an AI that is as smart as a human, we need to be careful about how we design its motivational system and how we structure its decision-making process. That is, we need to be careful about what goals it is trying to achieve. We need to make sure that the AI is not trying to achieve the goals that are harmful to humanity. That is, we need to make sure that the AI is not trying to destroy humanity. But if we can do that, then even if the AI creates more AIs, the new AIs will also be designed to not destroy humanity. This is the key idea behind the Friendly AI (FAI) approach. So, the foom scenario is a rather extreme version of a problem that is much more likely to occur in the real world. That is, if we don’t have a FAI, the AI might not become a superintelligent being, but it might become a tool that is misused. So, the foom scenario is not the main risk, but the misuse of a powerful AI is. But then again, if we can’t make a FAI, then the foom scenario is a possibility. So, the problem",482,500,338,0.261,0.3112,0.9509,0.9008,0.9502,0.9509,-1.0574,-1.0409,0.3496,0.3827,0.0403,0.0367,0.0087,0.0081,0.4152,0.5112,0.9813,0.9292,0.40625,0.3683304647160069,0.5269922879177378,6,5,0.9489,0.9808,0.10580912863070539,0.142,0.1301775147928994,0.9158,0.5881,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,UFOs as US PsychOp.txt,"UFOs are objects in the sky that often seem to display amazing physical abilities. We have four main categories of theories to explain them. Under two kinds of theories, these abilities are illusory: (A) They could be errors, delusions, and misunderstandings, like seeing Venus or swamp gas. Or (B), they could be lies and hoaxes, intended to fool others. Under the other two kinds of theories, these abilities are real: (C) They are from aliens. Or (D) they are from Earth orgs that have been hiding their amazing abilities. To estimate the chance of each kind of theory, one should multiply a prior chance for each type, a chance which ignores any concrete evidence of actual sightings, times a posterior chance that if each theory were true, we’d see the sort of sightings evidence that we do. (Renormalize these products to get posteriors.) A year ago I argued that the prior chance on the aliens theory wasn’t nearly as low as many seem to think; its much higher than in a typical murder trial, for example. So you have to actually look at the sightings evidence to judge its posterior chance, just as you would in a murder trial. Today I want to consider the hoax category. In particular I want to consider the following hoax conspiracy theory: some part of the US government has, since the 1940s, had a long-term campaign to pay people to lie about seeing UFOs, and to make fake evidence to fool others into thinking they saw objects with amazing abilities. Of course once enough people heard about these events, then most reported sightings after that might be errors, delusions, and misunderstandings. During the Second World War, the US government managed some pretty large and effective conspiracies. Such as the Manhattan project and the many ways they mislead Germany about our D-Day invasion. They seem thus to have then been roughly capable of managing a large UFO conspiracy. But, yes, the duration of this purported conspiracy would be much longer than in these prior examples. Those prior successful conspiracies were also more closely related to military activities. Do we have evidence of a US ability or inclination regarding conspiracies more distant from military operations? Yes, in fact. The US had large and successful efforts, kept hidden for many decades, to move the fashion in art and writing away from Soviet styles, toward “modern” US styles. To make the US seem more prestigious relative to the USSR in the world’s eyes. Okay, but what might the US government see itself as standing to gain from such a conspiracy? First, it is already known that the US government has promoted UFO groups in particular areas, and fed them false info on UFOs. They did this to “muddy the waters” regarding new tech that the US was developing and testing in the skies. Spies of foreign powers might plausibly hang near US testing facilities, and ask around around for reports of strange sightings.","Such spies would get less useful info if local UFO groups are inclined to report many strange things unrelated to US tech testing. In the Cold War, a big priority of the US military was to discourage enemies from launching a nuclear war against the US. And as an enemy is more likely to attack when then feel more confident of the consequences of their attack, one way to discourage such attacks is to muddy the waters re US military abilities, and re other possible powers who might react to such an attack. So if US could get enemy leaders to take UFO reports seriously, it could get those leaders to worry that they have underestimated US abilities, or that there are another hidden powers around. Many UFO reports and interpretations have given the impression that the powers behind UFOs are especially interested in nuclear power and nuclear weapons, and that they fear or disapprove of such things. Enemy leaders who give credence to such reports might then fear that, if they initiated a nuclear attack, they’d suffer retaliation from such powers. Or maybe they’d just step in to take control after such a war weakened all of its participants. I estimate roughly a one percent prior for this scenario, which is substantially higher than the prior I assigned to UFOs as aliens. Furthermore, this theory seems to quite naturally account for the key puzzles I struggled to explain regarding an aliens theory, namely that they are here while the universe looks empty, and that they stay near the limits of our vision, neither making themselves clearly visible nor completely invisible. This hoax category thus has the strongest posterior, in my view. (Yes I haven’t discussed the other two theory categories much; maybe I’ll say more on those some other day.) Note that conditional on this UFO as US psychop theory being true, we should give more credence to other US conspiracy theories, such as that the US faked the moon landings. I thus now give more credence to this, even if I still see it as less likely than not. And conditional on believing other such theories, this UFO as US psychop theory becomes more believable. Added 10a: As the two US WWII secrets I mentioned were kept for only a few years, some say large orgs can’t keep secrets longer than that. But the US kept secret for 41 years that it faked its excuse for the Vietnam war, and for 46 years that it spied on citizen phone calls via Project Minaret. KFC has kept its recipe secret for 70 years, and Coca-Cola has kept its secret for 130 years. Venice kept its glass-blowing methods secret for many centuries, and China kept secret its methods of making both silk and porcelain for over a thousand years. Yes, there’s a difference between hidden and known secrets, but all else equal known secrets should be more vulnerable, as the curious can focus their efforts on revealing them. Much harder","Then, in case the foreign spies were to discover the real tech, they could be warned off. So, the US government would have a reason to have a long-term UFO conspiracy. But here’s the problem: the US government would have to be involved in creating and maintaining a large-scale, long-term conspiracy. That requires a lot of people working on it, and a lot of resources. That would be expensive. Also, it would require the US government to have a consistent policy, to not only create but also maintain this conspiracy over a long period of time. This seems unlikely. Because, in the long run, it would be hard to maintain a large-scale conspiracy without detection. Also, the US government is a huge organization, and with so many people working for it, it’s hard to have a consistent policy. There’s also the matter of the US government’s reputation. If the government were to be exposed as having a long-term conspiracy, that would be a huge scandal, a major embarrassment. But here’s a different thought: perhaps the government is not the one behind the conspiracy, but rather some private organization, or some other group. Maybe the US military? Or some private group with a lot of money and resources, perhaps a private defense company. But then, even if the US government is not the one, this is still a question of whether the US has the capability or inclination to maintain such a conspiracy. But even if the US government isn’t the one, the question is still whether the US has the capability or inclination to maintain such a conspiracy. So, if there is such a conspiracy, it would be a US-based one. The US government, or some other US-based group, is behind the UFO conspiracy. But, again, how likely is this? The key question is whether the US government or a US-based organization would have the capability and inclination to maintain a long-term, large-scale conspiracy. To evaluate this, we can look at other examples of",495,500,334,0.3019,0.2723,0.9853,0.8877,0.7571,0.8667,6.1692,-2.5641,0.3832,0.3076,0.0375,0.0503,0.0069,0.015,0.5273,0.4802,0.9696,0.954,0.38608695652173913,0.41785714285714287,0.45707070707070707,6,5,0.9832,0.9533,0.14545454545454545,0.1,0.17964071856287425,0.9346,0.6373,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,On Liberty vs. Efficiency.txt,"To ""win"" a debate you aren't supposed to tip your opponent to the arguments you'll use. But to promote a more productive conversation, that is exactly what you might do. So in this post I'll lay out my basic (rather technical) argument for tonight's debate. I've said:
The topic, as I see it, is the relative value/importance for economists of pushing ""liberty,"" i.e., a policy of minimal government interference, and ""efficiency,"" a standard policy evaluation metric that attempts to neutrally weigh policy consequences for different people. Humans often find themselves in conflicts where they might make (and enforce) ""deals"" instead of ""fighting"" (or doing ""nothing""). Such conflicts are often complex enough for many parties to be uncertain how they would fare, relative to fighting, under various possible deals. In such situations, I see a noble and important role for expert arbiters who are ""neutral,"" i.e., who develop deserved reputations for suggesting ""win-win"" deals where most or all parties should expect to benefit, relative to fighting. Given access to such neutral expert advisers, conflicting parties can make better deals, to their mutual benefit. One reason I'm proud to be an economist is that we often fill this neutral expert arbiter role to varying degrees, and could do so even more if we tried. And ""efficiency,"" also known as ""cost-benefit analysis,"" helps make this possible. To estimate the efficiency of a deal, relative to a status quo, one adds up estimates for each person of the dollar value that person would place on this deal. Each person's dollar value of a deal is (minus) the compensation he or she would need to become indifferent to (i.e, not care to choose) this deal plus compensation package, relative to the status quo. This says how much he wants the outcomes produced by this deal (and may or may not agree with what he says he wants). The sum of such dollar values says how efficient, or good, is the deal; if it is positive, the deal is good; else it is bad. Of course since estimates can err, one can be mistaken about who wants a deal how much. So when cash compensations can be cheaply implemented, economists recommend using individual value estimates to design cash transfers that maximize the chance everyone benefits from a deal. We also recommend the meta-deal of consistently implementing efficient-enough deals (plus cash transfers when cheap) across many disputed topics. The law of large numbers ensures that unless our estimate errors are strongly correlated, the more topics we add to a meta-deal, the more confident we can be that everyone will benefit, in the sense of getting more of what they want. If you believed that economists fairly and consistently estimated individual deal values, then there is only one way you could expect not to benefit from the meta-deal of consistently following their advice across many topics. This would be if you had private information showing you were consistently hurt more than they expect, in topic after topic.","This would have to be info economists cannot see, and that you cannot credibly communicate. Such a scenario is possible, but extreme. The real problem is not such extreme possibilities, but the assumption that economists fairly and consistently estimate individual deal values. If economists are ""partisan,"" i.e., if they consciously or unconsciously try to favor some folks over others when estimating efficiency, and if the social institutions that combine individual contributions do not sufficiently balance or correct for such partisan bias, then economists' net advice could also be partisan. This would make it more likely, though hardly imply, that many folks might on net lose from the meta-deal of consistently following economists' deal advice. Economists have many social conventions that reduce partisan influences: We prefer efficiency as a neutral evaluation criterion. We prefer clear simple math models with explicit assumptions, and prefer particular standard assumptions; these allow models to be more easily compared, and discourage searching for favorable assumptions. We similarly prefer explicit statistical data analysis, and prefer particular standard statistical models and techniques, again facilitating comparison and discouraging search. Peer reviewers watch for partisan bias, and interest groups fund economists to flag partisan contributions by opposing interests. Even so, I must admit that partisan influences pervade professional economists, often due to shared partisan sympathies among the most influential economists. Yes, this limits the usefulness of following economists' advice, especially on politically charged and high profile topics. And I am saddened to see little interest in institutions, such as prediction markets, that could substantially reduce such partisan bias. Yet, do not let the best be the enemy of the good; economists have much relevant expert knowledge, and their advice does on average help folks find win-win deals. Economic efficiency is tarnished, but still powerful. No other large community of expert advisers has anywhere near the economists' deserved reputation for consistently suggesting win-win deals. The more that economists agree, and the further from politically charged topics, the more your can trust their advice. What else can we rely on, besides economists' expert advice, to suggest good deals to conflicting parties? A variety of cheap heuristics are available, of varying quality. The height heuristic, i.e., prefer the outcome suggested by the tallest person, has little to recommend it. The majority rule heuristic, i.e., prefer the outcome a majority says they prefer, is better but can give multiple conflicting answers, can depend on how issues are bundled, can suffer from saying diverging from wanting, and can poorly reflect an unequal status quo. ""Liberty"" is the heuristic of always preferring outcomes that minimize government involvement. As cheap and easy-to-apply heuristics go, this one is pretty good. Given two random deals the freer one is probably more efficient. Given two actually proposed deals, instead of two random ones, my guess is that the freer deal tends to be more efficient. But this is not a claim that economists as a whole endorse; this is just my personal guess. And freer deals are clearly not always","But the problem is that economists are not as consistent as we might like. We can be wrong about the value of deals, and we can be wrong about the distribution of such values. So if we don't have private information, and we can't be sure that economists are consistently wrong, then we might be better off not following their advice across many topics. But if we do follow their advice, then we might be better off in the long run, because the law of large numbers suggests that unless we're systematically wrong, the more we follow their advice, the more we can expect to benefit. This is a bit abstract, but it's the core of my argument. If you are not familiar with cost-benefit analysis, then this is the part you might need to understand first. I think the key here is that economists have a responsibility to be accurate in their value estimates, and to be transparent about the uncertainty of such estimates. If we do that, then the long-run benefits of following their advice (if we are not systematically wrong) can outweigh the short-term costs of being wrong. But the question is: what is the relative value/importance of ""liberty"" and ""efficiency"" for economists? So, to get back to the debate, I'm arguing that efficiency is more important for economists than liberty, and I'm arguing that this is because economists are not as consistent as we might like in estimating the value of deals. So I'm arguing that we should be more focused on efficiency than on liberty. I'll be giving more arguments for this in the next post. For now, I'm just setting the stage for the debate. The key idea is that we have a responsibility to be accurate in our value estimates, and to be transparent about the uncertainty of such estimates. If we do that, then the long-run benefits of following their advice (if we are not systematically wrong) can outweigh the short-term costs of being wrong.

Robin Hanson,On UFOs-As-Aliens Priors.txt,"A careful analysis of UFOs should consider lots of data, and consider it in much detail. I oft hear skeptics seek shortcuts, such as by declaring all testimony invalid, or insisting that only some long conjunction of encounter features could be sufficient. But consider a legal accusation of attempted murder. Even though the prior odds that a random X attempts to kill Y during hour Z is terribly low (<10-12), we are still willing to entertain such claims, and we accept personal testimony as an important part of supporting evidence. Yes, advocates of things like UFOs seem willing to put more time into such details, and it may seem unfair to expect skeptics to put in as much work. But jurors and lawyers must put in a lot of effort in legal trials. This is the great problem of how to divide intellectual labor; as with most topics, we do best if we task a few with going into great detail on each topic, so the rest of us can defer to their analysis. If you aren’t willing to go into sufficient detail, then admit this isn’t one of your topics, and defer to others on it. In that spirit, instead of expressing opinions on many UFO topics, let me instead focus on the area where I have the most relative expertise: the priors to associate with the some-UFOs-are-aliens hypothesis. As far as I can tell, the main reason that most give for skepticism that aliens visit Earth in the UFO style is that this theory seems a priori crazy unlikely. But that estimate seems wrong to me. Let me explain. A full Bayesian analysis of the four main UFO theory categories (error, hoax, secret Earth orgs, aliens) needs eight numbers: one prior and likelihood for each theory. In this post I try only to estimate one of these eight numbers: the prior for the aliens theory. Here goes. Life exists here on Earth, and our standard best theories say that this was not a miracle, nor was Earth the only place such things could happen. Furthermore, our universe also seems very large (perhaps infinite). Thus our standard best theories predict that advanced life has appeared and will appear many times out there. These standard best theories also predict a wide range of dates when this could happen. As a result, two independent alien origins are likely to be millions to trillions of years apart in time. Which gives aliens a lot of time to travel to visit other aliens. So we can break down doubts on prior expectations about UFO as aliens into three parts:
What is the chance that advanced aliens appear often enough in space and time for some of them to have been born early and close enough to travel to Earth to be here now? What is the chance that aliens (or, more likely their robot descendants) who can travel actually do travel to Earth by now, but do not visibly remake the local universe?","Given that aliens exist, and travel to here, but don’t remake the local universe, what is the chance that they would act the way that UFOs seem to act, i.e., being somewhat evasive, but not completely hiding nor announcing themselves? First, how close might aliens be? As my co-authors and I discuss here, humans seem to have arrived quite early in history, at least if one assumes that the universe would remain empty and wait indefinitely for advanced life like us to appear. This is the main reason we offer for postulating a grabby aliens deadline, to explain human earliness. And our grabby aliens model implies that aliens do appear often enough for maybe some of them to have come here by now. Now grabby aliens arriving by here now would also be quite visible to us now. But our basic model is quite consistent with variations wherein there are many, perhaps thousands or millions, of non-grabby alien civs per grabby civ, all born at the same sort of places and times. These non-grabby civs do not remake their local universe. So either they die fast, life long but do not expand, or they expand long but do little to remake their universe. In my view, the most likely scenario that puts long-expanding-but-not-remaking aliens here now is panspermia siblings. Life arose long ago on some very rare Eden, which then seeded our Sun’s stellar nursery, with life quickly spreading to most stars in that nursery. At least two of these stars eventually developed advanced life, but Earth was not the first. Aliens at the first star looked for their panspermia siblings, noticed simple life on Earth here long ago, and then long ago traveled to near here to await the arrival of advanced life. Where they now do their weird UFO encounter things. So to explain UFOs as aliens, we must postulate that these first star sibling aliens had preferences and coordination abilities sufficient to do the following: prevent any parts of their own civ from expanding and visibly remaking the local universe, travel to sibling stars that might birth civs, to stand ready to prevent them from also expanding, but also not kill them, and while waiting here they allow or induce the sort of UFO encounters we see, but prevent any clearer more direct interactions. I estimate a chance of at least 10% for each of the following events, given the prior events: Earth was seeded by panspermia in its nursery A sibling star gave rise to a long-lived advanced civ long before now That civ prevents itself from expanding, tries to prevent siblings from expanding, and long ago traveled to here to wait to enforce this preference, They induce or allow UFO-style encounters while they wait here. Note that #1 requires a high enough rate of rock transfer between star systems, #2 requires that most of the great filter happened on Eden, #3 is more likely when civs adopt strong “world” governments, and #4 is relatively likely","What is the chance that a small number of aliens (or their robot descendants) have actually been here, and have left some kind of visible trace? Let's consider each of these in turn. First, the chance that advanced aliens appear often enough in space and time for some of them to have been born early and close enough to travel to Earth to be here now. If we accept that our universe is large and that life is common, then the chance that some advanced aliens are born in a region of space that is close enough to Earth to be able to travel here is high. The question is whether this is the case. If the universe is large and life is common, then even with a very low probability of a civilization developing, the total number of such civilizations would be large. For example, if the probability of a planet developing intelligent life is 1 in 1000, and the number of planets is 10^22, then the expected number is 10^19, which is a huge number. This is the standard ""Great Filter"" argument, but in this case, the filter is not in the future but in the past. The fact that life exists on Earth, and that life is common in the universe, means that the filter is not in the future. So the chance that some advanced aliens are born in the vicinity of Earth is high. Now, the next question: What is the chance that aliens (or their robot descendants) who can travel actually do travel to Earth by now, but do not visibly remake the local universe? This is a question about the behavior of aliens. If they are visiting Earth, they might not want to make a big deal of it, or they might be trying to be subtle. However, we have no direct evidence of such behavior. But we also have a lot of evidence that aliens are not visiting Earth in a visible way. For example, no one has seen any alien spacecraft landing, no",500,500,342,0.2452,0.3075,0.9621,0.9487,0.8164,0.9801,4.9474,-0.4375,0.3668,0.4291,0.0568,0.1294,0.0154,0.0887,0.4134,0.3593,0.9759,0.9687,0.4166666666666667,0.3996447602131439,0.5012987012987012,5,7,0.9361,0.9707,0.126,0.126,0.12573099415204678,0.9303,0.6596,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Privately Enforced & Punished Crime.txt,"I’ve been teaching law & economics for many years now, and have slowly settled on the package legal reforms for which I most strongly want to argue. I have chosen a package that seems big enough to inspire excitement and encompass synergies, and yet small enough to allow a compelling analysis of its net benefits. My proposal is regarding how to detect, prosecute, and punish criminal law. It is not about non-criminal law, and it is not a proposal to change how we decide what acts are crimes, when to be persuaded by a particular crime accusation, how hard to work to discourage each criminal act, nor how hard to work to catch each criminal act. To start, I hold constant how we do these other things. Now you might happen to think that we are very bad today at labeling acts as crimes, evaluating accusations, and choosing detection and discouragement priorities. So bad in fact that you think it a bad idea to make law more effective at detecting, prosecuting, and punishing crime. You might then prefer to reduce our criminal law enforcement abilities, such as via slashing police budgets or arbitrarily hindering police. For example, by requiring police to wear big bricks on their ankles. And you might not want my proposal adopted until you first figure out how to fix the rest of criminal law. But you might still want my solution available for later. I’d be happy to work with you to design fixes for those other parts of the system. Just not today, not in this post. Today I focus on detection, prosecution, and punishment of crime. Non-crime law deals mostly with accidents and mild sloppy selfishness among parties who are close to each other in a network of productive relations. In such cases, law can usually require losers to pay winners cash, and rely on those who were harmed to detect and prosecute violations. This approach, however, can fail when “criminals” make elaborate plans to grab gains from others in ways that make they, their assets, and evidence of their guilt hard to find. Ancient societies dealt with crime via torture, slavery, and clan-based liability and reputation. Today, however, we have less stomach for such things, and also weaker clans and stronger governments. So a modern society instead assigns government employees to investigate and prosecute crimes, and gives them special legal powers. But as we don’t entirely trust these employees, we limit them in many ways, including via juries, rules of evidence, standards of proof, and anti-profiling rules. We also prefer to punish via prison, as we fear government agencies eager to collect fines. Yet we still suffer from a great deal of police corruption and mistreatment, because government employees can coordinate well to create a blue wall of silence. I propose to instead privatize the detection, prosecution, and punishment of crime.","My proposal isn’t especially original; many similar changes have been proposed before, and I can’t be bothered to do sufficient historical research to support public claims on who deserves how much credit for which suggestions. So I’ll instead just argue for a certain package of changes, and let historians work out the credit. The key idea is to use competition to break the blue wall of silence, via allowing many parties to participate as bounty hunter enforcers and offering them all large cash bounties to show us violations by anyone, including by other enforcers. With sufficient competition and rewards, few could feel confident of getting away with criminal violations; only court judges could retain substantial discretionary powers. That is, all laws are enforced, and enforced equally on everyone everywhere. Police and prosectors no longer have discretion to quietly ignore particular kinds of crimes like jaywalking that they think unworthy of their efforts. Or to prioritize crime in rich neighborhoods over poor ones. Or refuse to prosecute crimes by police or friends of the mayor. Enforcers are fully responsible for any harms they cause in attempting to pursue criminals. The legal system could still prioritize some people, acts, or neighborhoods, if it did so openly and explicitly, via officially declared legal parameters. Okay, let’s get to the details. There are three big related changes: Full Legal Liability Insurance – To get and keep a driver’s license today, one must usually show insurance able to pay others a certain minimum amount if found liable in a car accident. I propose to require that everyone get insurance to cover a high maximum liability for legal violations. At least a few million dollars. The main requirement to be an insurance firm here is to have deep enough pockets to pay client liabilities. Ideally clients and their insurers would retain a lot of freedom to make deals of their choosing, including over premiums, co-payments, etc., as long as it remains clear which insurers are responsible for paying for which clients. With full legal liability insurance, parties with deep pockets would sit on both sides of all criminal cases. No longer could a deep pocket side gain by threatening to force the other side to spend more than they have. Cash Fines For Most Everything – With deep pocket insurers available to pay, we can use fines to punish most all legal violations. This makes it possible to avoid prisons for punishment, which are terribly inefficient. And if the rest of us feel that these fines sufficiently compensate us for crimes, we could make clients and insurers free to choose many details of how best to prevent and minimize the costs from crime, choices we now make awkwardly and centrally, taking too little context into account. Clients and insurers could make trades between preventing crime via monitoring and limiting client actions before a crime, or preventing crime via fear of punishment and loss after a crime. They might agree on (and arrange to pay for) specific","I would not privatize the entire process. I would privatize the detection and prosecution, while keeping the punishment of crime in the public sphere. The reason for this is that punishment is the only part of the process that requires the use of force, and we should not privatize the use of force. That said, if we privatize detection and prosecution, we can make these processes more efficient and effective. The idea is that private firms would be more efficient in these roles than government employees. We can imagine that the government would contract with a private firm to detect and prosecute crimes, and the government would retain the right to punish criminals, including by prison. The government would also retain the power to define what is a crime and to decide when to be persuaded by a crime accusation. The government would also retain the power to decide which crimes to detect and prosecute, and how hard to work to detect and prosecute each. The government would still be responsible for enforcing the law, and would still be responsible for deciding who gets what punishment. But the detection and prosecution would be done by private firms. The key is that the private firms are not government employees, so they are not subject to the same incentives that government employees face. For example, government employees might be subject to political pressure, and to the temptation to be corrupt or to be lazy. But private firms are not subject to these things. They have to be efficient. They are not in a position to be corrupt. They are not in a position to be lazy. Their profit motive is a powerful incentive to be efficient. So the government would contract with a private firm to detect and prosecute crimes. The firm would be paid by the government, and the government would be the one who is responsible for the outcomes of the process. So the firm would be motivated to be efficient and effective, not to be corrupt or to be lazy. But since the firm is not a government employee, it would not have the same legal protections, and would not",478,500,361,0.2039,0.167,0.9797,0.9102,0.9603,0.8524,0.8333,-2.9762,0.3341,0.3662,0.0221,0.0615,0.0032,0.022,0.6805,0.4787,0.9756,0.9271,0.39162112932604737,0.36541889483065954,0.494949494949495,5,5,0.9732,0.9267,0.1401673640167364,0.106,0.09695290858725762,0.914,0.5403,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,16 Fertility Scenarios.txt,"World population is widely projected to peak around 2050-90 at roughly 9-11B, with ~40% living in Africa. World population would then decline. But how long, and how far? The median respondent in my Twitter polls expects a population revival ~2150, and only 15% see population falling below 2B. So most expect this to be a mild and temporary problem. But I’m not so sure. In this post, I’ll review some possible scenarios. First, let’s set some context. Starting in France ~250 years ago, the number of children born to each woman in her lifetime, her “fertility”, consistently fell as incomes rose. Though some say this “demographic transition” is most closely connected to female education and access to contraception/abortion than to income. The most proximate causes I see are the high status of career success requiring high youthful efforts, a preference for fewer higher status kids, and an increasing taste for leisure. Fertility usually falls more rapidly from 4-7 down to ~2, then falls more slowly below 2. Rich nations now average ~1.4, with some as low as 0.8. If world fertility averaged 1.4 for 25-year generations after a peak of 10B, humanity would go extinct in 1660 years. If fertility instead averaged 1.0, that would take only 830 years. Most think extinction unlikely, and I agree with them, but such a risk shouldn’t be taken lightly. As I discuss in my last post, it seems that a shrinking world population would robustly lead to a shrinking world economy, and then innovation rapidly coming to a halt, which seems pretty scary. Given how naturally people resist change, it might be hard to restart a culture of innovation once it’s been long lost. Okay, now we can list possible scenarios:
Extinction: None of the other scenarios appear by a deadline, whose timing depends on just how low average world fertility rates fall. Poverty: When a shrinking economy gets poor enough, fertility might rise again, the reverse of how fertility fell as the world got rich. Big War: A big war might destroy much wealth suddenly, inducing poverty that increases fertility, and also maybe more directly increasing fertility. Wealth: Some say that even though, in the last few centuries, fertility has been falling with increasing wealth, that switches to fertility increasing with more wealth at a sufficiently high wealth level. Old Moms: If tech allows longer lives, then female fertility might be greatly increased at older ages, with older parents retaining sufficient youthful energy to raise kids, and so kids after early career prep might become common. This tech must arise before economy shrinks. Frozen Eggs: Cheap reliable egg-freezing (or egg-making) and IVF, together with older parents retaining sufficient youthful energy to raise kids, could also work. (Today 2% of US kids are via IVF.) This tech must arise before economy shrinks. Robot Nannies: Artificial wombs only ease a few months of parenthood. But robot nannies could help with all the rest.","This must arise before economy shrinks, and mainstream cultures would have to evolve to approve of their use. Last Career: Artificial intelligence replaces humans on most all jobs, leaving parenting as one of the few meaningful activities that we are reluctant to give machines. Many then are willing and eager to be parents. This must arise before economy shrinks. DNA Selection: DNA that induces individuals to have more kids may get more common. This hasn’t happened so far in 250 years, but should eventually. This probably works mainly by making people care less about social status and conformity relative to having or raising kids. Such folks may be less cooperative, like dark triad types. They can’t be penalized for being anti-innovation until that restarts. Insular Subculture: Initially small subculture(s) arise that highly value fertility, reliably keep members from leaving, and care little about what other cultures say of them. They probably achieve this by disrespecting outsiders, and defying many cherished outsider values. This tempts mainstream cultures to repress them, but such repression needs to mostly fail. As it wins, this subculture likely discards many elements of tech and culture that we now treasure; it can’t be penalized for being anti-innovation until that restarts. Maybe Africa creates insular culture to keep its fertility high. Parenting Factories: Mainstream cultures change to allow or encourage raising kids in the equivalent of big boarding schools or orphanages. Via regimentation of kid lives, and low individual attention, these achieve strong scale economies, and thus greatly lower the cost of raising kids. Gap Decade: Mainstream cultures change to taboo career training during say ages 16-26, pushing people to instead raise kids during this period. (Maybe induce triplets, to do all your kids at once.) Under this arrangement, mothers would no longer be at a career prep disadvantage. Financial assistance would be needed from families, nations, or investors. Gender Roles: Mainstream cultures return to traditional gender roles, cutting the status of female career success, relative to parenthood. This discourages most women from early career prep. Contraception and abortion might also be discouraged or banned. Nation Subsidy: Some nations subsidize raising kids at levels much higher than tried so far, paying for this with high taxes. To prevent nations with falling populations from grabbing this nation’s expensively-made young adults, such emigration is either prevented by force or highly taxed. Emigration taxes might start when local fertility is high. World culture evolves to not see such policies as “coercing” women into motherhood. Kid Debt/Equity: Some nations let parents endow their kids with debt and equity obligations, selling such assets to investors to pay for their parenting expenses. Such nations use force to prevent such kids from emigrating to nations that would let them evade such obligations. World culture evolves to not see such debt, equity, and emigration blocks as “slavery”. Age of Em: A world of brain emulations arises, and most humans convert to becoming ems, after which far fewer care whether the remaining humans eventually go extinct. This","If robot nannies become affordable, then it could allow people to have more kids at older ages, even if they have to be more efficient with their time. This tech must arise before economy shrinks. Global Overpopulation: If the world population is over 9B, as projected, and if the global population is too high to be sustainable, then that might lead to a collapse, or a hard choice. I think the latter is more likely. The question is, will we be able to live with that high population? Maybe we can, but we might be forced to live in very restricted conditions. If the world population is over 9B, and we are not willing to live in very restricted conditions, then it might lead to a collapse. So the world might have to choose between a high population with low quality of life, or a low population with high quality of life. So, the key issue is: Will we be able to live with a high population (as projected) or not? That is, will we be able to live with a population of 9-11B, or not? The answer is not clear. The problem is that in the current world, people have a high population, but a high quality of life. So we are used to that. But if the population is high, but the quality of life is low, that might be very bad. So, the question is: can we sustain 9-11B without sacrificing the quality of life? I think that the answer is yes, but I’m not sure. If we can, then the world would be in a very good position, with the population peak, and then a gradual decline. But if not, then we might have to choose between a high population and low quality of overpopulation, or a low population and high quality. So, the key is: can we live with a high population? Let me think about that. If we can, then the population",489,500,328,0.2415,0.2382,0.9419,0.9402,0.9602,0.9709,0.6345,0.4589,0.3315,0.3372,0.0273,0.0439,0.0109,0.0141,0.4501,0.556,0.9294,0.9451,0.31951640759930916,0.3236301369863014,0.5013054830287206,5,4,0.9913,0.9619,0.1738241308793456,0.15,0.1676829268292683,0.9118,0.5461,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,"Alien Life Info, But Not Status, Found.txt","A new Journal of Cosmology article says that sealed deep in the water-clay-full sort of (CI1 carbonaceous) meteorites that likely come from comets, one consistently finds forms that look visually and chemically like ancient bacteria fossils. Typical reactions:
This effort clearly falls into the category of “extraordinary claims” that require extraordinary evidence. (more)
Dr David Marais, an astrobiologist with NASA’s AMES Research Centre, said he was very cautious about jumping on the bandwagon. These kinds of claims have been made before, he noted and found to be false. “It’s an extraordinary claim, and thus I’ll need extraordinary evidence,” he said. (more)
Those are odd and intriguing formations, to be sure. … Contamination, no matter how unlikely, is a more mundane explanation than extraterrestrial life, and Occam’s Razor will always shave very closely here. We have to be very, very clear that contamination was impossible before seriously entertaining the idea that these structures are space-borne life. I’ll be honest: my own reaction is one of extreme skepticism. As it should be! All things being equal, I would take news like this with a very large grain of salt, and want a whole lot of outside expert analysis. (more)
The last one links to this explanation:
Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence because they usually contradict claims that are backed by extraordinary evidence. The evidence for the extraordinary claim must support the new claim as well as explain why the old claims that are now being abandoned, previously appeared to be correct. Alas, these attitudes make far more sense in status terms than in information terms. In status terms, it would of course be big news to hear that academia had declared its consensus that alien life had most likely been found. Academia’s public and patrons would take heed, and the academics associated with inducing that event would gain high status. So academics want to ensure that only folks with quite impressive academic abilities could gain such a prestigious honor. Thus they naturally want to that this honor goes to folks with extremely impressive data, methods, etc. And this paper, published in a low prestige journal by a low prestige academic, using solid but not especially difficult techniques, seems below that bar. But in information terms, this new result does seem in the ballpark of tipping us over the threshold of thinking it likely than alien life has been found. First, our prior estimate that alien life would be found in comet-based meteorites should have been pretty high. The idea that life came here from out there is a standard reasonable view:
Panspermia is no longer a marginalized view. It may not yet be the majority opinion, but it shows up often in journal articles and conference proceedings. Counting by volume, comets seem the most likely place to find such life, and so meteorites from comets would be the most likely place to find alien fossils. We also seem to see alien fossils from Mars.","Furthermore, the only known betting market on this topic has for 15 years consistently said we’d find evidence of alien life by 2050: Not only should our prior on finding alien life in comets be high, the likelihood of this new data seems much higher if alien comet life were common than if it didn’t exist. This new data was careful to examine only opened surfaces in a sterile vacuum: The study was confined to investigations of uncoated, freshly fractured, interior surfaces of the meteorites. All tools, sample holders and stubs were flame sterilized. Lunar dust samples and silicon wafers were used as negative controls. … The meteorites were stored in sealed vials at -80 oC and after preparation, electron microscopy stubs were kept in sealed containers in dessicator cabinets or in the freezer. The fusion crust and old cracks in the stones were carefully avoided. The meteorite samples were placed in the instrument chamber (with the fresh fracture surface up) a pumped down immediately after the stones were fractured. All solvents, acids or other liquids were strictly avoided. … Only one seriously Murchison sample was found to be contaminated with fungal filaments (in old cracks in the fusion crust) and not a single pollen grain has been encountered during extensive studies of carbonaceous meteorites carried out since 1996 at the NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center. Furthermore, the chemical signatures found match ancient fossils far better than recent life. And how could meteorites that fell to Earth a century ago get contaminated with ancient Earth fossils? Yes these forms might have non-biological explanations, but the point is the likelihood ratio – that such forms that look much like known life are much more likely given life than given not. Informationally, a nearly neutral prior together with a strong new likelihood ratio should have us now accepting the claim as more likely than not. But academia will not publicly admit that fact until they can find a status holder to credit who they consider worthy of the honor. The journal says: Members of the Scientific community were invited to analyze the results and to write critical commentaries or to speculate about the implications. These commentaries will be published on March 7 through March 10, 2011. I’d bet these commentaries will mostly say this is interesting but doubts remain, that this evidence is too ordinary to support its “extraordinary” conclusion, and yet they’ll refuse to bet on the subject. How sad is that? Added 2:30p: This claims Ladbrokes offers 1000 to one odds against finding alien life, but I can’t find more details online. This says William Hill offers 100 to one odds against “proof of the existence of intelligent extra-terrestrial life will be provided within a year”, but there’s no word on longer time scales. PaddyPower‘s odds estimate a <20% chance “The sitting President of the USA making a statement confirming without doubt the existence of alternative life beings from another planet” after 2020, and a <30% chance for before 2020 (including","The fact that we have found life in meteorites is something that is not yet proven, but the evidence is there. The evidence is that we have found in these meteorites structures that are like ancient bacteria. (more)
So, in the end, the paper is “extraordinary” but not so extraordinary that it’s not worth considering. So, if it is true, that would be a big deal. But if it's false, that would be a big deal too. But it's a big deal either way. (more)
So, the question is, what is the probability that this paper is correct? What is the probability that these structures are extraterrestrial life?

Robin Hanson,Responses to Sex Inequality Critics.txt,"As I promised yesterday, here are specific responses to the nine mass media articles that mentioned my sex redistribution post in the eight most popular media outlets, as measured by SemRush “organic traffic”. (For example, the note (21M) means 21 million in monthly traffic.) Quotes are indented; my responses are not. My responses are somewhat repetitive, as most seem content to claim that self-labeled “incels” advocating for sex redistribution are deeply icky people, and especially that they are women-hating. Even if that were true, however, that doesn’t to me say much about the wisdom or value of sex redistribution. I’m much more interested in general sex inequality than I am in the issues of the tiny fraction self-labeled “incel” activists. Robin Abcarian, The idea of an ‘incel rebellion’ would be laughable if it hadn’t already resulted in so many murders, Los Angeles Times (21M), May 8, 2018. The only thing that feels inevitable about it is that men — even smart ones who should know better — would seriously try to address a perverse and dangerous issue, i.e. that men have the right to have sex with women. Framing this idiotic idea as a real social problem is another assault on the hard-won right of American women to control their own bodies … The incel community is not motivated by sexual frustration. That is a smoke screen for the real agenda. … It is motivated by old-fashioned misogyny, rank sexism and male entitlement. I didn’t suggest giving men a right, nor taking any from women. I’m interested in general sex inequality, but not in the problems or agendas of the tiny “incel community.”
Moira Donegan, Actually We Don’t Owe You Sex, and We Never Will, Cosmopolitan (15M), May 4, 2018. The idea that men are entitled to sex, and that women owe it to them, was first plucked from the incel community after the Toronto attack by Robin Hanson, an economist at George Mason University, who took to Twitter and to his personal blog to advocate for a “redistribution” of sex. … The rights and desires of women who would be “redistributed” in this scenario aren’t thought of much at all. The idea that individual men might have a right to sex the way that they have a right to safety and survival was then taken up by Douthat. …
By taking the incels’ claims at face value, he legitimized their ideas, and forwarded the assumption that if some men can’t get laid, it’s not because they’re creeps or jerks, but because women have too much independence. … Sex is an activity, one that you need two willing, capable people to do. Incels don’t really want that. What they want is a right to rape on demand, a right not to see women as people with rights and desires of their own, but only as objects to be fucked.","But in the real world, where women are at least nominally full citizens with control over their own sex lives, some men will inevitably go unlaid in order for women to go unraped. … Women are not interchangeable, we are not commodities, and we will not be “distributed” against our will. The choice of who we have sex with will always be only our own. I didn’t suggest a right or entitlement for men. I’m interested in general sex inequality, but not in the legitimacy or personal problems of the tiny “incel community.” Just as our income redistribution policies give both sides a veto over each employer-employee relation, sex redistribution policies can give both parties a veto over each sex act. Clarence Page, The incel mind: As if hating women will get you a girlfriend, Chicago Tribune (12M), May 4, 2018. Robin Hanson, a George Mason University economist, provocatively argues that “the desire for some sort of sexual redistribution” may be no more ridiculous than the notion of redistributing income to the less advantaged. Sex adviser Dan Savage proposes the incel phenomenon offers an argument for loosening our laws and attitudes toward professional sex workers. Others have proposed stepping up development of sex robots. None of these alternatives strikes me as particularly satisfying in the long run. Among us “normies,” incel slang for normal non-incel folks, young people often discover that their desire for sex masks an underlying deeper desire to be loved. An inability to love and care about other people may be the real tragedy of the incel world. The policies you mention might put a dent in general sex inequality. I don’t care much if they won’t solve personal problems within the tiny “incel community.” David J. Ley, Monogamy and Violence, Psychology Today (11M), May 21, 2018. Hanson suggested that legalized prostitution, education or training, promotion of monogamy and discouraging promiscuity, were all strategies which might more equitably distribute the opportunity to have sex across a wider range of persons. The redistribution of sex was widely reacted to as indicating some form of legalized rape, where women might be forced somehow to be sexual with men they would not otherwise have chosen.… There is some surprising evidence, at least tangentially supportive of the argument that Hanson and Peterson make. Multiple research studies have revealed (link is external)that societies which are polygamous have higher rates of violent crime. … Note, however, that all of these arguments are based on the treatment of sex with females, and reproduction, as economic commodities. Women have something which men desire, and perhaps even need, in order to reproduce. When female sexuality is treated as an economic resource, it does indeed support the notion that this resource may be utilized or controlled in utilitarian manner, to further social interests. Men who cannot mate or get a date, are viewed as inferior, broken and worthless. … Where Peterson and Hanson’s arguments fail, is that they are using data, research, evidence, and theories, based on","… The incel idea is that men are not entitled to sex, but that women are. … I didn’t suggest giving men a right, nor taking any from women. I’m interested in general sex inequality, but not in the issues or agendas of the tiny “incel community.”
Dana Goldin, The Rise of the ‘Incel’ Movement, The New York Times (16M), May 3, 2018. The incel movement is a fringe, anti-social group, a small subset of men who feel that they are not getting the sex they want, and who believe that they are entitled to it. … This movement is not a new one. It has been around in different forms for a long time. … The incel movement is not about redistribution of sex, but rather about the idea that men are entitled to sex, which is a dangerous and misguided idea. …
The incel movement is not about redistribution of sex, but rather about the idea that men are entitled to sex, which is a dangerous and misguided idea. … Incels believe that the only reason that they are not getting sex is that women are too independent, not that they are not attractive, not that they are not good at socializing, or not that they are not into them. … I didn’t suggest giving men a right, nor taking any from women.

Robin Hanson,AI Progress Estimate.txt,"From ’85 to ’93 I was an AI researcher, first at Lockheed AI Center, then at the NASA Ames AI group. In ’91 I presented at IJCAI, the main international AI conference, on a probability related paper. Back then this was radical – one questioner at my talk asked “How can this be AI, since it uses math?” Probability specialists created their own AI conference UAI, to have a place to publish. Today probability math is well accepted in AI. The long AI battle between the neats and scruffs was won handily by the neats – math and theory are very accepted today. UAI is still around though, and a week ago I presented another probability related paper there (slides, audio), on our combo prediction market algorithm. And listening to all the others talks at the conference let me reflect on the state of the field, and its progress in the last 21 years. Overall I can’t complain much about emphasis. I saw roughly the right mix of theory vs. application, of general vs. specific results, etc. I doubt the field would progress more than a factor of two faster if such parameters were exactly optimized. The most impressive demo I saw was Video In Sentences Out, an end-to-end integrated system for writing text summaries of simple videos. Their final test stats:
Human judges rated each video-sentence pair to assess whether the sentence was true of the video and whether it described a salient event depicted in that video. 26.7% (601/2247) of the video-sentence pairs were deemed to be true and 7.9% (178/2247) of the video-sentence pairs were deemed to be salient. This is actually pretty impressive, once you understand just how hard the problem is. Yes, we have a long way to go, but are making steady progress. So how far have we come in last twenty years, compared to how far we have to go to reach human level abilities? I’d guess that relative to the starting point of our abilities of twenty years ago, we’ve come about 5-10% of the distance toward human level abilities. At least in probability-related areas, which I’ve known best. I’d also say there hasn’t been noticeable acceleration over that time. Over a thirty year period, it is even fair to say there has been deceleration, since Pearl’s classic ’88 book was such a big advance.Robin Hanson
I asked a few other folks at UAI who had been in the field for twenty years to estimate the same things, and they roughly agreed – about 5-10% of the distance has been covered in that time, without noticeable acceleration. It would be useful to survey senior experts in other areas of AI, to get related estimates for their areas. If this 5-10% estimate is typical, as I suspect it is, then an outside view calculation suggests we probably have at least a century to go, and maybe a great many centuries, at current rates of progress.","Added 21Oct: At the recent Singularity Summit, I asked speaker Melanie Mitchell to estimate how far we’ve come in her field of analogical reasoning in the last twenty years. She estimated 5 percent of the way to human level abilities, with no noticeable acceleration. Added 11Dec: At the Artificial General Intelligence conference, Murray Shanahan says that looking at his twenty years experience in the knowledge representation field, he estimates we have come 10% of the way, with no noticeable acceleration. Added 4Oct’13: At an NSF workshop on social computing, Wendy Hall said that in her twenty years in computer-assisted training, we’ve moved less than 1% of the way to human level abilities. Claire Cardie said that in her twenty years in natural language processing, we’ve come 20% of the way. Boi Faltings says that in his field of solving constraint satisfaction problems, they were past human level abilities twenty years ago, and are even further past that today. Let me clarify that I mean to ask people about progress in a field of AI as it was conceived twenty years ago. Looking backward one can define areas in which we’ve made great progress. But to avoid selection biases, I want my survey to focus on areas as they were defined back then. Added 21May’14: At a private event, after Aaron Dollar talked on robotics, he told me that in twenty years we’ve come less than 1% of the distance to human level abilities in his subfield of robotic grasping manipulation. But he has seen noticeable acceleration over that time. Added 28Aug’14: After coming to a talk of mine, Peter Norvig told me that he agrees with both Claire Cardie and Boi Faltings, that on speech recognition and machine translation we’ve gone from not usable to usable in 20 years, though we still have far to go on deeper question answering, and for retrieving a fact or page that is relevant to a search query we’ve far surpassed human ability in recall and do pretty well on precision. Added 14Sep’14: At a closed academic workshop, Timothy Meese, who researches early vision processing in humans, told me he estimates about 5% progress in his field in the last 20 years, with a noticeable deceleration. Added 4Jan’15: At a closed meeting, Francesca Rossi, expert in constraint reasoning, gave an estimate of 10%, with deceleration. Margret Boden, author of Artificial Intelligence and Natural Man (1977), estimated 5%, but for no particular subfield. Added 6July’15: David Kelley, expert in big data analysis, says 5% in last twenty years, sees acceleration only in last 2-3 years, not before that. Added 18Apr’16: Henry Kautz, says in constraint satisfaction we were at human level 20 years ago and have moved to super human levels now. In language, he says we’ve moved 10% of the way, with a noticeable acceleration in the last five years. Added 13July2016: Jeff Legault says that in robotics we’ve come 5% of the way in the last 20 years, and there was only acceleration","(But I don’t know the math here, so I’ll just say that the outside view suggests that, and that I don’t think we’re anywhere near human level yet.) 

The passage is a reflection on the progress of AI over the past twenty years, comparing it to the distance to human-level abilities. The author has a background in AI research, including work at Lockheed and NASA, and has presented at major conferences like IJCAI and UAI. The author notes that the field has made steady progress, with a 5-10% increase in the distance covered toward human-level abilities. The author also acknowledges that the field has not accelerated significantly over the past two decades, and that the progress is likely to continue at a similar pace, suggesting that it could take a long time to reach human-level AI. The author also mentions a specific example of an AI system that can generate text summaries of videos, which is a significant achievement. The author is cautious about the future of AI and suggests that there may be a long time before human-level AI is achieved. 

The author also notes that the field has moved from a time when probability-based approaches were considered radical to a time when they are widely accepted. The author also mentions that the AI field has a long history of debate between different schools of thought, and that the neats (those who emphasize math and theory) have generally been more successful in the long term. The author also suggests that the progress in AI is not as fast as it could be, and that it may take a long time to reach human-level abilities. 

The author also mentions that other experts in the field have similar estimates, and that this suggests that the progress is likely to be slow over the long term. The author also mentions that the field has a long way to go, but is making steady progress. The author also acknowledges that there are still many challenges in AI, and that the field is still far from achieving human-level abilities.

Robin Hanson,Replace G.P.A. With G.P.C._.txt,"Most schools assign each student a “grade point average”, i.e., a number that averages over many teacher evaluations of that student. Many schools also assign each teacher an “average student evaluation”, i.e., a number that averages over many student evaluations of that teacher. Many workplaces similarly post evaluations which average worker performance ratings across different tasks. And sport leagues often post rankings of teams, which average over team performance across many contests. A lot rides on such metrics, even though they are simple aggregates over contests of varying difficulty, which creates incentives for players to “game” these metrics. For example, students seek to take, and teachers seek to teach, easy/fun classes; workers seek to do easy tasks, and sport teams seek to play easy opponents. Yet we have long known of a better way, one I described briefly in 2001: stat-model-based summary evaluations. For example, imagine that a college took all of their student grade transcripts as data, and from that made a best-fit statistical linear regression model. Such a model would predict the grade of each student in each class by using a linear combination of features of each class, such as subject, location, time of day and week, and also “fixed effects” for dates, professors, and especially students. That is, the regression formula would include a term in its sum for each student, a term that is a coefficient for that student, times one or zero depending on if that datum is about a grade for that student. Such a fixed effects regression coefficient regarding a student should effectively correct for whether the student took easy or hard majors, classes, profs, times of day, year of degree, etc. Furthermore, standard stat methods would give us a “standard error” uncertainty range for this coefficient, so that we are not fooled into thinking we know this parameter more precisely than we do. Thus a “grade point coefficient”, i.e., a G.P.C., should do better than a G.P.A. as a measure of the overall quality of each student. And the more that potential employers, grad schools, etc. focused on G.P.C.s instead of G.P.A.s, the less incentive students would have to search out easy classes, profs, etc. We could do the same for student evaluations of professors, and the more we relied on prof fixed effects to judge profs, then the less incentives they would have to teach easy classes, or to give students As to bribe them to give high evaluations. The general idea is simple: fit performance data to a statistical model that estimates each performance outcome as a function of the various context parameters that one would expect to influence performance, plus a parameter representing the quality of each contestant. Then use those contestant parameter estimates as our best estimates of contestant quality. Such statistical models are pretty easy to construct, and most universities contain hundreds of people who are up to this task.","And once such models are made and listened to, then contestants should focus more on improving their quality, and less on trying to game the evaluation metric. Yes, as new data comes in, the models would get adjusted, meaning that contestant estimates would change a little over time, even after a contestant stopped having new performances. Yes, there will be questions of how many context parameters to include in such a model, but there are standard stat tools for addressing such questions. Yes, even after using such tools, there will remain some degrees of freedom regarding the types and functional forms of the model, and how best to encode key relevant factors. And yes, authorities can and would use those remaining degrees of freedom to get evaluation results more in their preferred directions. But even so, this should be a huge improvement over the status quo. Instead of students looking for easy classes to get easier As, they’d focus instead on improving their overall abilities. To prove this concept, all we need is one grad student (or exceptional undergrad) with stat training willing to try it, and one university willing to give that student access to their student transcripts (or student evals of profs). Once the models constructed passed some sanity tests, we’d try to get that university to let its students put their G.P.C.s onto their student transcripts. Then we’d try to get the larger world to care about G.P.C.s. So, who wants to try this? P.S. I’ve posted previously on how broken are many of our eval systems, and how a better entry-level job eval system could allow such jobs to compete with college. Added: This paper and this paper shows in detail how to do the stats. One could get more than one useful number per student by adding terms that interact the student fixed effect terms with other features of classes. That second paper shows a two number system is more informative, but is rejected because “gains realized with the two-component index are offset by the additional complexity involved in explaining the two-component index to students, employers, college administrators and faculty.” One might allow students to experiment with classes in new subjects by including a term that encodes such cases. One might include terms for race, gender, age, etc. of students, though I’d prefer transcripts to show student GPCs with and without such terms. Added 17Oct: This book by Valen Johnson considers in detail models like those I describe above, wherein the performance of a student in a class is a linear combination of a student term, a class term, and an error. Except that sometimes instead of estimating a grade point, they instead estimate discrete grades, using several terms per class to describe the underlying parameter cutoffs between different discrete grades. The student term sets an “adjusted GPA” and Johnson proposes to “allow students to optionally report adjusted GPAs on their transcripts.” He reports that when he attempted but failed to get Duke to do","But they are not being used, because the system is designed to allow for “incentive compatibility” in the sense that it is easier for students to game the system by taking easy classes, which would improve their GPA. The problem is that the current system is not “efficient”, in the sense of game theory, because it allows for manipulation. But if we could design a system that is “efficient”, in the sense of game theory, and not allowing manipulation, then we could get the better metrics. But how? The answer is that we need to design a system that is not only efficient, but also “incentive compatible” in the sense that the agents (students, teachers, workers, etc.) are motivated to behave in the way that the system is designed to reward. So the key is to make the system “incentive compatible”, not just efficient. The problem is that in the current system, the GPA is a “score” that is the sum of many things, and people are allowed to manipulate the system by selecting the right things to do. However, if we could find a way to design a score that is both efficient and incentive compatible, that is, a score that gives the correct result (i.e., the correct value of the quantity we want to measure) and is not manipulated by the agents, then we would be in good shape. The question is: how can we do this? The answer is that we need to find a score that is the correct value of the quantity we want to measure, and that is also not manipulated by the agents. That is, we need a score that is a “correct” measure, and that is not manipulated. The key idea is that if we can model the data in such a way that the score we are calculating is not a sum over many things, but is rather a parameter that is estimated from the data, then we can avoid the manipulation. In the example of the student GPA, if we",484,500,340,0.3336,0.1118,0.9782,0.9297,0.7888,0.6353,3.6261,7.772,0.366,0.2922,0.031,0.0326,0.0011,0.0021,0.6182,0.5277,0.9478,0.9034,0.3540925266903915,0.37347294938917974,0.5012594458438288,6,7,0.9961,0.9651,0.17768595041322313,0.138,0.1323529411764706,0.8542,0.6982,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,More Or Less Sacred.txt,"Children were almost twice as likely to be willing to share their most treasured belonging after winning the game than after losing. … Only people in the first group—primed to consider the unreliability of their close friends or romantic partners—reported greater uncertainty that they could count on others and an increased attachment to objects.

Many adults own a ‘favorite dress’ or a ‘lucky sweatshirt’ to which they feel emotionally attached, whether for aesthetic (‘I like how I look when I wear it’), sentimental (‘My mother gave me this necklace’), or superstitious purposes (‘If I wear this on gameday, my football team will win’). … For example, an older woman who possesses an art project her child made in elementary school may find that, over time, her attachment to the art project increases the more that she uses it as a cue to reminisce about her time as a young mother.

We like to see sacred things as pure, lasting, clearly distinguished from profane things, and not in conflict with each other. Thus in our view things aren’t more or less sacred, there is just the mutually-supporting package of sacred things clearly distinguished from everything else, and such sacred things were always this way. We did not choose or make the sacred. But in fact, we do choose and cause some things to be sacred, things are sacred to varying degrees, and these degrees often change gradually over time as a direct result of our choices. And I think the clearest way to see all this, and to see in detail how the sacred works, is to look at the slow personal processes by which get deeply attached to ordinary people, places, events, and things. (Children and the elderly both do this more, just as tend they both tend to be more religious.) Looking at some concrete examples, I can see how this works in me, and I think if you try you will be able to see it it you as well. For example, when shopping for shirts, we are quite willing to consider many details and tradeoffs. But then once we buy a shirt and wear it for many years, we become much less willing to sell or trade it for other shirts. And we come to like it less for its particular features, or for particular aspects of how it fits or looks. Its details matter less; it matters more as a symbol. Our shirt has become identified with us, and we have become identified with it. By embracing this shirt, we bond with all the other people we have been in the past, and all the people will be in the future, at least all wearing this shirt. The identify-affirming property of our shirt feels especially important to us when our identity is threatened; for example, you seem especially likely to wear your favorite shirt after a romantic breakup.","In this state, we seem quite eager to embrace implausible claims about how our favorite shirt expresses or embodies high ideals. We might see it as using our favorite color, see the words on it as the motto of our life, or see its design as the perfect quintessence of shirt design. We often similarly idealize our favorite amusement park, restaurant, person, TV show, or holiday; we are eager to find ways to see them as embodying widely accepted high ideals. And we are reluctant to see any of our favorite things as in conflict with each other; why of course I could wear my favorite shirt to my favorite restaurant on my favorite holiday. In fact, the things we chose will vary in how easily they are in fact idealized. For example, compared to history or the arts, we find it harder to idealize sports, due to the higher salience in sports of selfishness, competition, bragging, numbers, and money. Science is easier to idealize than sports, but still harder than the arts, due to its emphasis on numbers, objective evaluation criteria, and skepticism regarding mysticism. As another example, I grew up going to Disneyland annually, so I often long to return there regularly, and I find myself eager to frame the place as achieving high ideals, even though many other academics hate it. While no particular view or activity there seems especially appealing to me in my imagination, the abstract idea of going back to be a kid again in the place I loved as a kid seems quite appealing. That abstract appeal doesn’t depend much on when I go there, or what I do there, and I feel a bit ashamed to wonder if the price is too high to make it a good deal. Our homes and families may not seem especially idealized when we see them up close during a holiday meal. After a few hours, we may even look to escape them. But months or years beforehand, and when far away, it seems very important to join them for that meal. There is little that inspires troops to fight for their country more than seeing themselves as defending their sacred homes and families, see abstractly from afar. And medicine inherits much of its sacred appeal from the way it is said to have helped some preserve their sacred families against the threat of death. All of this helps us to see how the sacred works. Whatever we get attached to, we come to value. And then we naturally look for ways to idealize those things and value them more by seeing them more abstractly, as if seeing them from a distance. This distance method helps us to see and value such things the same across our lives, as our perspectives change. And it helps us to see and value such things the same across diverse communities. While we have rules regarding appropriate beliefs and attitudes toward sacred things, we actually accept compromises quite often there.","(more)
I find the idea that the more you like something, the less you like it when you have to give it up, to be quite compelling. I find that this is a very human thing, and that it is something that is not only a matter of our emotional preferences, but also of our psychological processes, which are not only about feeling, but about thinking and meaning. The reason that we can feel so strongly about something that we are reluctant to give it up is because we have come to see it not just as a thing, but as a symbol of who we are. So, for example, the shirt is not just a shirt, it is a symbol of my identity. If I lose that shirt, I lose part of my identity. So, the more I identify with the shirt, the more I fear losing it. And I think that this is not just with objects, but also with people. We do not just like people because they are nice or because they are smart or because they are good at something. We like people because we identify with them. We like people because we see ourselves in them. We like people because we have come to see them as part of our identity. And we are not just like people because they are nice, but because we have come to see them as part of our identity. (more)
The emotional attachment to things is not just a matter of how much we like them, but also of how much we have come to see them as part of our identity. The more we have come to see them as part of our identity, the more we are willing to go to great lengths to protect them, and the more we are willing to suffer for them. (more)
So the question becomes, how do we decide what is important to us? It's not just the things that we like. It's not just the things that we value.

Robin Hanson,Try-Try or Try-Once Great Filter_.txt,"Here’s a simple and pretty standard theory of the origin and history of life and intelligence. Life can exist in a supporting oasis (e.g., Earth’s surface) that has a volume V and metabolism M per unit volume, and which lasts for a time window W between forming and then later ending. This oasis makes discrete “advances” between levels over time, and at any one time the entire oasis is at the same level. For example, an oasis may start at the level of simple dead chemical activity, may later rise to a level that counts as “life”, then rise to a level that includes “intelligence”, and finally to a level where civilization makes a big loud noises that are visible as clearly artificial from far away in the universe. There can be different kinds of levels, each with a different process for stepping to the next level. For example, at a “delay” level, the oasis takes a fixed time delay D to move to the next level. At a “try once” level, the oasis has a particular probability of immediately stepping to the next level, and if it fails at that it stays forever “stuck”, which is equivalent to a level with an infinite delay. And at a “try try” level, the oasis stays at a level while it searches for an “innovation” to allow it to step to the next level. This search produces a constant rate per unit time of jumping. As an oasis exists for only a limited window W, it may never reach high levels, and in fact may never get beyond its first try-try level. If we consider a high level above many hard try-try levels, and with small enough values of V,M,W, then any one oasis may have a very small chance of “succeeding” at reaching that high level before its window ends. In this case, there is a “great filter” that stands between the initial state of the oasis and a final success state. Such a success would then only tend to happen somewhere if there are enough similar oases going through this process, to overcome these small odds at each oasis. And if we know that very few of many similar such oases actually succeed, then we know that each must face a great filter. For example, knowing that we humans now can see no big loud artificial activity for a very long distance from us tells us that planets out there face a great filter between their starting level and that big loud level. Each try-try type level has an expected time E to step to the next level, a time that goes inversely as V*M. After all, the more volume there is of stuff that tries, and faster its local activity, the more chances it has to find an innovation. A key division between such random levels is between ones in which this expected time E is much less than, or much greater than, the oasis window W.","When E << W, these jumps are fast and “easy”, and so levels change relatively steadily over time, at a rate proportional to V*M. And when E >> W, then these jumps are so “hard” that most oases never succeed at them. Let us focus for now on oases that face a great filter, have no try-once steps, and yet succeed against the odds. There are some useful patterns to note here. First, let’s set aside S, the sum of the delays D for delay steps, and of the expected times E for easy try-try steps, for all such steps between the initial level and the success level. Such an oasis then really only has a time duration of about W-S to do all its required hard try-try steps. The first pattern to note is that the chance that an oasis does all these hard steps within its window W is proportional to (V*M*(W-S))N, where N is the number of these hard steps needed to reach its success level. So if we are trying to predict which of many differing oases is mostly likely to succeed, this is the formula to use. The second pattern to note is that if an oasis succeeds in doing all its required hard steps within its W-S duration, then the time durations required to do each of the hard steps are all drawn from the same (roughly exponential) distribution, regardless of the value of E for those steps! Also, the time remaining in the oasis after the success level has been reached is also drawn from this same distribution. This makes concrete predictions about the pattern of times in the historical record of a successful oasis. Now let’s try to compare this theory to the history of life on Earth. The first known fossils of cells seems to be from 0.1-0.5 Ga (billion years) after life would be possible on Earth, which happened about 4.2 Gya (billion years ago), which was about 9.6 Ga after the universe formed. The window remaining for (eukaryotic) life to remain on Earth seems 0.8-1.5 Ga. The relatively steady growth in max brain sizes since multi-cellular life arose 0.5 Gya suggests that during this period there were many easy, but no hard, try-try steps. Multi-celluar life seems to require sufficient oxygen in the atmosphere, but the process of collecting enough oxygen seems to have started about 2.4 Gya, implying a long 1.9 Ga delay step. Prokaryotes started exchanging genes about 2.0 Gya, eukaryotes appeared about 1.7 Gya, and modern sex appeared about 1.2 Gya. These events may or may not have been the result of successful try-try steps. Can we test this history against the predictions that try-try hard step durations, and the window time remaining, should all be drawn from the same roughly exponential distribution? Prokaryote sex, eukaryotes, and modern sex all appeared within 0.8 Ga, which seems rather close together, and leaving a long uneventful period of almost ~2 Ga before them. The clearest hard step duration","If E is much less than W, then the oasis is likely to reach the next level. If E is much greater than W, then the oasis is likely to fail. So the great filter is at the point where E is about equal to W. In this theory, the “great filter” is not necessarily the same for all oases, but is a common problem that many of them face. In fact, the same filter is at the same place for all oases, but each oasis is going through it in a different way. That is, the same filter is in the same place, but each oasis may have a different rate of passing through it, and hence a different probability of success. So, the great filter is not a single event, but a range of events that all oases must pass through, and which are common to all of them. The theory also includes the idea that the great filter is at the level where the level of intelligence is. That is, we are not going to be able to find many other intelligent civilizations in the galaxy, because the great filter is between the level of life and that of intelligence, or between intelligence and civilization, or between civilization and the ability to send messages that are detectable. This theory is not the same as the “great filter” theory in the literature, which is more commonly associated with the idea that life is very common but civilizations are not. However, in this theory, the great filter is not necessarily at the point where life is, but can be at any level, and it is not necessarily at the point where life is, or even in the early levels. The theory is also not the same as the “Great Filter” theory in the literature. Wait, but the user wrote that the theory is “not the same as the “great filter” theory in the literature, which is more commonly associated with the idea that life is very common but civilizations are not.” So the user is saying that this is",498,500,350,0.2465,0.3192,0.9719,0.9719,0.6149,0.9862,-9.7618,-0.35,0.3825,0.4221,0.0442,0.0801,0.0057,0.016,0.3605,0.381,0.9456,0.9246,0.41739130434782606,0.3923611111111111,0.5417721518987342,8,6,0.9327,0.9915,0.11044176706827309,0.174,0.10571428571428572,0.9742,0.6805,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Bow To Our Future Overlords.txt,"The political left and right each have a big long term problem about which they cry most. For the left it is global warming; for the right fertility decline. (Sure, a few tech people cry about AI, but far fewer than re these others.)
Great efforts are devoted to these causes by well meaning folks, and this does induce concrete actions that do “move the needle”. But few seem willing to face a hard fact: neither problem is likely to be solved in the recommended way. While at some level people do kinda know this, they are too invested in outrage re it still not being too late. (It just feels so good to focus on outrage.)
Re global warming, yes, we could still adopt huge well-enforced carbon taxes and other regs to cut material consumption. And yes we keep getting global deals to do so. But they keep being deals without teeth, and they keep being violated. Yes, a few nations are doing what they agreed, but far from enough. Yes we are developing better alt tech, but it’s far from good enough to keep us from emitting carbon. Overall we are only somewhat delaying a high carbon emission future. So some of us at least should think about a Plan B. To figure out how to adapt to a high carbon world, such as one warmer with higher sea levels and more storm variance. Plan for your descendants to keep away from low flooding shores, and maybe move to nicer climates, like say Canada or Russia. Or maybe try geo-engineering to artificially block sunlight, but without global permission, which is unlikely to come. Re fertility decline, yes, as the main change in the last half century is the number of women who become moms, not the number of kids per mom, all we need is a larger fraction of women having kids. Yes, as that used to happen, it must still be feasible. Yes, a big enough subsidy per kid would work, and we could make the new kids pay for that via government debt. And yes, as we’ve seen fertility rise at some times and places, there’s historical variation that we could plausibly mine to find factors to promote fertility. However, it takes voters who want more kids to vote in politicians who promote them. After all, the cultural ask re higher fertility is huge, plausibly even larger than to cut carbon emissions. The trends to be opposed are in both cases deeply embedded in existing culture, and in ways that most of us treasure. Societies in history that have loudly lamented fertility declines, and tried to reverse them, either among elites or more widely, have consistently failed. This includes recent versions of our societies. Our world’s fertility decline has been pretty consistent for ~2.5 centuries, and local deviations have so far always been temporary. Thirteen years ago I guessed fertility to be our biggest problem, but didn’t let it distract me much.","Two years ago I guessed that insular fertile subcultures is how fertility decline will end, but still didn’t let the topic distract me. A few months I realized that innovation would grind to a halt during a declining economy, and since have read and talked much on the topic. Alas this has confirmed my worse fears. I’m not sure quite how best to persuade you all of this, but world population will soon fall fast, and then unless we achieve full AGI or end aging by then, our total world economic capacity will also fall, with scale economies and innovation rates both falling roughly in proportion. Actually innovation will fall faster due to diminishing returns, populations getting older, and lower-than-Western African innovation quality. And the most likely way fertility rises again is via the rise of Amish-like insular fertile cultures. Like how Christians outbred the rest of the Roman Empire. (Amish have doubled every two decades for over a century.) Their rejection of tech, innovation, and large scale econ processes will hurt them much less in an era of little innovation and shrinking econ scales. Yes they will face obstacles in adapting to encompassing an entire economy, and in defending themselves. Some factions may, like the Mormons, fly too close to the world cultural Sun and assimilate to it and its fertility habits. But even so, these seem much better positioned to win out than any identifiable competitors. If no one succeeds, we go extinct. The main thing that the discussions of fertility I’ve seen most miss is the centrality of insularity. Activists often seek factors they could push to promote fertility, but don’t seem to notice how hard it will be to get groups to deviate from world culture standards as our world gets more tightly integrated culturally. Over recent centuries nations have tended to have quite different cultures rather resistant to outside influence, and yet these were quite insufficient levels of insularity; world cultures greatly converged. So in addition to getting some group to adopt a more pro-fertility culture, you also need that group to become quite culturally insular. The Amish and a few others have achieved the required level, but it is a rare achievement that has only happened a few times worldwide in the last few centuries. Thus, as with global warming, I’m pulled to consider a Plan B. If in fact, as I expect, one or more Amish-like cultures take over the world by just outbreeding the rest, they become our world’s new “overlords”. So if we want to influence the world they will control, we probably need to mostly achieve that via their consent and cooperation. In this role, we must bow to and serve our future overlords. Amish-like insular fertile subcultures are known for living in small rural pacifist egalitarian fundamentalist-religious isolated communities, and limiting their tech to be small scale and socially insular. That is, they don’t want members to interact much with outsiders, and so don’t like techs that allow or","But now I see that fertility decline is a bigger problem than climate change. Because of the time it takes to have kids, and the time it takes for the population to be reborn. So the bigger problem is not the one that we can solve the fastest. That is, even if we could solve climate change immediately, it’s not as bad as fertility decline. But the longer it takes to fix climate change, the more it seems like we’re not going to fix it, and the more we’re going to have to adapt to it. But the longer it takes to fix fertility decline, the more it seems like we’re not going to fix it, and the more we’re going to have to adapt to it. So in a way, both are problems that are hard to solve, and both are problems that we need to adapt to. However, fertility decline is a more fundamental problem. Because even if we could solve climate change, but we can’t reverse fertility decline, the population would still shrink. So the bigger problem is not the one that we can solve the fastest, but the one that we can’t solve at all. So, in the long term, even if we could solve climate change, we’d still be in trouble. But if we can’t solve fertility decline, then even if we could solve climate change, we’d still be in trouble. So, the real problem is not one or the other, but both. But, in the short term, the bigger problem is the one that is more urgent, which is climate change. Because the climate change problem is more immediate. So, the conclusion is that we need to address both. But the long term problem is the fertility decline, and the short term is climate change. But how do we deal with both? What are the solutions? What are the plans for the future? What are the steps to take now?

Robin Hanson,The Planiverse .txt,"I recently praised Planiverse as peak hard science fiction. But as I hadn’t read it in decades, I thought maybe I should reread it to see if it really lived up to my high praise. The basic idea is that a computer prof and his students in our universe create a simulated 2D universe, which then somehow becomes a way to view and talk to one particular person in a real 2D universe. This person is contacted just as they begin a mystical quest across their planet’s one continent, which lets the reader see many aspects of life there. Note there isn’t a page-turning plot nor interesting character development; the story is mainly an excuse to describe its world. The book seems crazy wrong on how its mystical quest ends, and on its assumed connection to a computer simulation in our universe. But I presume that the author would admit to those errors as the cost of telling his story. However, the book does very well on physics, chemistry, astronomy, geology, and low level engineering. That is, on noticing how such things change as one moves from our 3D world to this 2D world, including via many fascinating diagrams. In fact this book does far better than most “hard” science fiction. Which isn’t so surprising as it is the result of a long collaboration between dozens of scientists. But alas no social scientists seem to have been included, as the book seem laughably wrong there. Let me explain. On Earth, farming started when humans had a world population of ten million, and industry when that population was fifty times larger. Yet even with a big fraction of all those people helping to innovate, it took several centuries to go from steam engines to computers. Compared to that, progress in this 2D world seems crazy fast relative to its population. There people live about 130 years, and our hero rides in a boat, balloon, and plane, meets the guy who invented the steam engine, meets another guy who invented a keyboard-operated computer, and hears about a space station to which rockets deliver stuff every two weeks. Yet the entire planet has only 25,000 people, the biggest city has 6000 people, and the biggest research city has 1000 people supporting 50 scientists. Info is only written in books, which have a similar number of pages as ours but only one short sentence per page. Each building has less than ten rooms, and each room can fit only a couple of people standing up, and only a handful of books or other items. In terms of the space to store stuff, their houses make our “tiny houses” look like warehouses by comparison. (Their entire planet has fewer book copies than did our ancient Library at Alexandria.)
There are only 20 steam engines on their planet, and only one tiny factory that makes them. Only one tiny factory makes steel.","In fact most every kind of thing is made a single unique small factory of that type, and only produces a modest number of units of whatever it makes. Most machines shown have only a tiny number of parts. Their 2D planet has a 1D surface, with one continent divided into two halves by one mountain peak. The two ends of that continent are two shores, and on each shore the fishing industry consists of ~6 boats that each fit two people each and an even smaller mass of fish. I have a hard time believing that enough fish would drift near enough to the shore to fill even these boats once a day. As the planet surface is 1D, everyone must walk over or under everything and everyone else in order to walk any nontrivial distance. Including every rock and plant. So our hero has to basically go near everyone and everything in his journey from one shore to the mountain peak. Homes are buried underground, and must close their top door for the rivers that wash over them periodically. So in sum, the first problem with Planiverse is that it has far too few people to support an industrial economy, especially one developing at the rate claimed for this. Each industry is too small to support much in the way of learning, scale economies, or a division of labor. It is all just too small. So why not just assume a much larger world? Because then transport costs get crazy big. If there’s only one factory that makes a king of thing, then to get one of it to everyone each item has to be moved on average past half of everything and everyone. A cost that grows linearly with how many things and people there are. Specialization and transportation are in conflict. A second lessor problem is that the systems shown seem too small and simple to actually function. Two dimensions just don’t seem to offer enough room to hold all needed subsystems, nor can they support as much modularity in subsystem design. Yet modularity is central to system design in our world. Let me explain. In our 3D world, systems such as cells, organisms, machines, buildings, and cities consist of subsystems, each of which achieves a different function. For example, each of our buildings may have at least 17 separate subsystems. These deal with: structural support, fresh air, temperature control, sunlight, artificial light, water, sewage, gas, trash, security surveillance, electricity, internet, ambient sound, mail transport, human activities, and human transport. Most such subsystems have a connected volume dedicated to that function, a volume that reaches close to every point in the building. For example, the electrical power system has connected wires that go to near every part of the building, and also connect to an outside power source. In 2D, however, a volume can only have two or fewer subsystems of connected volumes that go near every point. To have more subsystem volumes, you have to","They have a single space station, which is built in a single location, and which only has a single launch pad. The whole thing is built on a single location, and only one launch pad. The whole thing is built on a single location, and only one launch pad. The whole thing is built on a single location, and only one launch pad. (This is a bit of a typo, but I think the author meant to say that the space station is built on a single location, and only one launch pad.)
The author’s reasoning is that the more dimensions you have, the more complex the system. So, the more complex systems require more energy, more space, and more people to build. But this is not correct. In reality, the complexity of a system is not directly proportional to the number of dimensions. For example, the complexity of a system could be due to the number of parts, the number of interactions between parts, or other factors. The number of dimensions is not the only determinant of complexity. However, the author’s logic is a reasonable one for the purpose of the story, and the book is not meant to be a scientifically accurate simulation. It’s more of a creative exploration of the implications of a 2D universe. 

In the context of this book, the author's approach is to use a 2D universe as a metaphor to explore various scientific and philosophical concepts. The author’s intention is to create a world that is both scientifically plausible and creatively engaging, even if it is not entirely accurate in all aspects. The book is a work of speculative science fiction, and the author is not expected to be a scientific authority but rather to use scientific principles as a foundation for the story.

The book’s success lies in its detailed and imaginative exploration of a 2D universe, which is a unique and engaging concept. The author’s collaboration with scientists is a key factor in the book’s scientific accuracy, even if it is not a perfect representation of",486,500,345,0.179,0.1661,0.9861,0.9556,0.8728,0.9547,-2.6131,-0.9306,0.3139,0.2851,0.0333,0.0549,0.0032,0.0043,0.4124,0.3885,0.9737,0.9512,0.3971119133574007,0.38879159369527144,0.4763092269326683,8,7,0.9936,0.9975,0.12139917695473251,0.134,0.12173913043478261,0.9487,0.5797,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,10 Implications of Automatic Norms.txt,"My last post observed that we seem to have a meta-norm that norm application should be automatic and obvious. We are to just know easily and surely which actions violate norms, without needing to reflect on or discuss the matter. We are to presume that framing effects are unimportant, and that everyone agrees on the relevant norms and how they are to be applied. If true, this has many implications:
1) We rarely feel much need to think about or discuss with others whether our own behavior violates norms. We either feel sure that we are innocent, or we feel at risk of being guilty. If we end up being seen as guilty, we’d rather be able to claim that we forgot, were distracted, or were overcome by passion. Any evidence that we discussed or thought carefully about the choice would instead suggest that we consciously choose to be guilty. 2) We aren’t much interested in ethics and misbehavior discussion or training for the purpose of helping us to figure out what to do personally. We may, however, be interested in using such things as a way to show others that we are devoted to good norms, and that we despise those who violate them. We are far more interested in norm preaching than learning or analysis. 3) We feel justified in accusing others of bad motives when they seem to us to violate norms. It seems to us that either they intended to be guilty, or they were inexcusably sloppy or lacking in control of their passions. We usually don’t need to wonder how they framed the situation, what norms they applied, or how they interpreted those norms. Of course we may not feel obligated to point out their violation, but we’d feel justified if we did. 4) We feel justified in describing those who claim to disagree with us about particular cases as either stupid or mean, or perhaps lacking a proper moral upbringing. With a proper upbringing, they are probably trying to excuse what they know to be their own guilty behavior. 5) We actually face a high risk of framing effects when interpreting particular acts as norm violating. We first learn norms by examples, and then we later apply learned norms to new examples. In both situations the result can depend on the particular examples, their context, and how we framed all this in our minds. If these were the main cognitive processes that produced norm application, then we’d all need to learn from a lot of pretty similar examples in order to reasonably have much confidence that we were all applying the same norms the same way. 6) In a relatively simple world with limited sets of actions and norms, and a small set of people who grew up together and later often enough observe and gossip about possible norm violations of others, such people might in fact learn from enough examples to mostly apply the same norms the same way.","This was plausibly the case for most of our distant ancestors. They could in fact mostly be sure that, if they judged themselves as innocent, most everyone else would agree. And if they judged someone else as guilty, others should agree with that as well. Norm application could in fact usually be obvious and automatic. 7) Today however, there are far more people, and more intermixed, who grow up in widely varying contexts and now face far larger spaces of possible actions and action contexts. Relative to this huge space, gossip about particular norm violations is small and fragmented. So it isn’t very plausible that we’ve all converged on how to reliably interpret most norms in most contexts. Thus today we must quite frequently make different judgements on whether actions violate norms. We may converge in judgement with our closest associates and gossip partners, at least on our most common topics of gossip. But for everyone else, if we consider the details of most of their behavior, we will find fault with a lot of it. As they would if they considered the details of our behavior. We are usually sure that we are innocent, but in fact that’s not how many others would categorize us. 8) We must see ourselves as tolerating a lot of norm violation. We actually tell others about and attempt to punish socially only a tiny fraction of the violations that we could know of. When we look most anywhere at behavior details, it must seem to us like we are living in a Sodom and Gomorrah of sin. Compared to the ancient world, it must seem a lot easier to get away for a long time with a lot of norm violations. Selection effects in who chooses to complain about which violations, and which violations others are willing to punish, may seem plausibly to make a big difference to who actually gets punished how much. We must also see ourselves as tolerating a lot of overeager busybodies applying what they see as norms to what we see as our own private business where their social norms shouldn’t apply. They may not complain out loud about us each time, but we know that they often judge us privately as violating norms, and for no good reason from our point of view. They should just butt out, we think. 9) Random effects of who frames which particular actions as norm violating or not may contribute substantially to who succeeds or fails overall. Some people don’t see a serious violation, and then find themselves punished for what they consider a triviality. They conclude someone had it in for them. Others see a serious potential violation, and pay substantial costs to avoid it, when they in fact faced little risk of punishment. Compared to the ancient world, today larger gains go to those with the social savvy to discern what norm violations others can more easily observe and are likely to punish, and the moral flexibility to act","But in a complex world, with many people, many more norms, and many more possible actions, we can’t all be expected to have the same norm application. 7) So we have to accept that there is no way for any of us to be sure that we are applying the right norms the right way. We are all to be in a state of uncertainty and possibly error. We are not to be in the position of thinking that we are in the right, that we are right, that we are correct, and that we are not wrong in the way that we have applied the norms. 8) We are also to accept that we may be wrong about the norms themselves.

Robin Hanson,This AI Boom Will Also Bust.txt,"Imagine an innovation in pipes. If this innovation were general, something that made all kinds of pipes cheaper to build and maintain, the total benefits could be large, perhaps even comparable to the total amount we spend on pipes today. (Or even much larger.) And if most of the value of pipe use were in many small uses, then that is where most of these economic gains would be found. In contrast, consider an innovation that only improved the very largest pipes. This innovation might, for example, cost a lot to use per meter of pipe, and so only make sense for the largest pipes. Such an innovation might make for very dramatic demonstrations, with huge vivid pipes, and so get media coverage. But the total economic gains here will probably be smaller; as most of pipe value is found in small pipes, gains to the few biggest pipes can only do so much. Now consider my most viral tweet so far:
Good CS expert says: Most firms that think they want advanced AI/ML really just need linear regression on cleaned-up data. This got almost universal agreement from those who see such issues play out behind the scenes. And by analogy with the pipe innovation case, this fact tells us something about the potential near-term economic impact of recent innovations in Machine Learning. Let me explain. Most firms have piles of data they aren’t doing much with, and far more data that they could collect at a modest cost. Sometimes they use some of this data to predict a few things of interest. Sometimes this creates substantial business value. Most of this value is achieved, as usual, in the simplest applications, where simple prediction methods are applied to simple small datasets. And the total value achieved is only a small fraction of the world economy, at least as measured by income received by workers and firms who specialize in predicting from data. Many obstacles limit such applications. For example, the value of better predictions for related decisions may be low, data may be in a form poorly suited to informing predictions, making good use of predictions might require larger reorganizations, and organizations that hold parts of the data may not want to lose control of that data. Available personnel may lack sufficient skills to apply the most effective approaches for data cleaning, merging, analysis, and application. No doubt many errors are made in choices of when to analyze what data how much and by whom. Sometimes they will do too much prediction, and sometimes too little. When tech changes, orgs will sometimes wait too long to try new tech, and sometimes will not wait long enough for tech to mature. But in ordinary times, when the relevant technologies improve at steady known rates, we have no strong reason to expect these choices to be greatly wrong on average.","In the last few years, new “deep machine learning” prediction methods are “hot.” In some widely publicized demonstrations, they seem to allow substantially more accurate predictions from data. Since they shine more when data is plentiful, and they need more skilled personnel, these methods are most promising for the largest prediction problems. Because of this new fashion, at many firms those who don’t understand these issues well are pushing subordinates to seek local applications of these new methods. Those subordinates comply, at least in appearance, in part to help they and their organization appear more skilled. One result of this new fashion is that a few big new applications are being explored, in places with enough data and potential prediction value to make them decent candidates. But another result is the one described in my tweet above: fashion-induced overuse of more expensive new methods on smaller problems to which they are poorly matched. We should expect this second result to produce a net loss on average. The size of this loss could be enough to outweigh all the gains from the few big new applications; after all, most value is usually achieved in many small problems. But I don’t want to draw a conclusion here about the net gain or loss. I instead want to consider the potential for this new prediction tech to have an overwhelming impact on the world economy. Some see this new fashion as just first swell of a tsunami that will soon swallow the world. For example, in 2013 Frey and Osborne famously estimated: About 47 percent of total US employment is at risk .. to computerisation .. perhaps over the next decade or two. If new prediction techs induced a change that big, they would be creating a value that is a substantial fraction of the world economy, and so consume a similar fraction of world income. If so, the prediction industry would in a short time become vastly larger than it is today. If today’s fashion were the start of that vast growth, we should not only see an increase in prediction activity, we should also see an awe-inspiring rate of success within that activity. The application of these new methods should be enabling huge new revenue streams, across a very wide range of possible application areas. (Added: And the prospect of that should be increasing stock values in this area far more than we’ve seen.) But I instead hear that within the areas where most prediction value lies, most attempts to apply this new tech actually produce less net value than would be achieved with old tech. I hear that prediction analysis tech is usually not the most important part the process, and that recently obsession with showing proficiency in this new analysis tech has led to neglect of the more important and basic issues of thinking carefully about what you might want to predict with what data, and then carefully cleaning and merging your data into a more useful form. Yes,","The overall point is that, in the case of data and prediction, the majority of value is in the simple, small applications that are widely available. So, the fact that the majority of firms in a given industry are not using advanced machine learning techniques is a sign that the majority of value is in the simple, small, and widely available applications. Hence, the economic impact of recent innovations in ML will be limited unless they are made simple, small, and widely available. So, the current state of ML is much like the state of pipes, and the current state of ML innovation is much like the state of pipe innovation. But here's the problem: even if we could get these innovations (for pipes or ML) to be simple, small, and widely available, the economic gains would be small. But if the innovations were instead made for the largest pipes (or for the biggest ML applications), then the gains would be larger. But the problem with making them for the largest pipes is that they are hard to do. So, we have a trade-off: we can get some gains by making simple, small, and widely available innovations, but those gains are small. Or we can get bigger gains by making more difficult innovations for the biggest pipes (or biggest ML applications), but those are harder to do and thus perhaps more risky. So, the problem is not that the ML industry is not innovating, but rather that the direction of the innovation is not aligned with the most economically valuable applications. So, the fact that the majority of firms are not using advanced machine learning techniques is a sign that the majority of value is in the simple, small, and widely available applications. Thus, the economic impact of recent innovations in ML will be limited unless they are made simple, and small, and widely available. So, the current state of ML is much like the state of pipes, and the current state of ML innovation is much like the state of pipe innovation.

Robin Hanson,Conquest and Liberation of Academia.txt,"During my graduate studies (’93-97), I looked at the history of prizes in science. I learned that from ~1600-1800, prizes funded science lots, and much more than did grants. But ~1830, science elites controlling top scientific societies in both Britain and France defrauded donors to switch funding to grants, which were then directed by society insiders to be given mostly to insiders. Thereafter such societies insisted that donors must fund grants, not prizes, if they wanted their donations to gain prestigious scientific society associations. Later, ~1900, tenure became common in academia. Then ~1940, peer review became common in publications, and ~1960 in grants. Also about midcentury, journalism switched from its usual mode of questioning and investigating claims made to it, to accepting whatever academics said and trying to “communicate” that to the public. In ~1980s, college rating systems became widely available to the US public, ratings which depended mainly how how elite academics rated those colleges. All of these changes were ways in which academic elites wrested control of academia from outsiders who previously imposed some degree of incentives and accountability. The elites of most any profession would love to fully control it, being given resources to spend at their discretion, with little need to accommodate demands of customers, investors, regulators, or anyone else. But academic managed to achieve this ideal far more than most, due to its peak prestige. Via elite schools, academics control prestige in many other areas of life. I review this history to make clear just what academic reformers are up against. It is far from sufficient to enumerate academic failures; you’ll have to develop concrete alternatives that can win prestige fights against the usual academics. History has long been moving against you; you’ll have to somehow reverse that strong tide. In my 40+ years of thinking about how we might reform academia, I’ve considered many different parties as potential allies in this venture. First I and other hypertext publishing fans hoped to use backlinks to make criticism of claims easy to find from those claims, thus recruiting critics and honest readers into our reform venture. But we’ve now achieved that ease of finding criticism, without much impact. Readers care far more about publication prestige than about which criticisms are persuasive to those who read them with care. Second, I saw the public as an ally willing to bet lots on science and related policy questions. However, we’ve seen that if academics choose to ignore such bets, the public isn’t much interested in them either. And laws continue to block such bets. Third, I saw research patrons as allies. Surely they’d want to fund research in ways more likely to induce intellectual progress, if only they understood the better ways. Like prizes instead of grants. But then I learned about the history of academia that I summarize above. No, patrons used to use better methods, but caved when academic threatened to take away their prestige by association.","Patrons care more about such prestige with academics than they do intellectual progress. Fourth, I hoped journal editors might be allies. But when we showed that polls and prediction markets could predict which papers wouldn’t replicate, and tried to get journal editors to publicly declare that they’d consider such predictions as part of their article approval process, all the journals refused. Journals are happy to publish sexy papers that don’t replicate. Now my best hope is to recruit as allies future folk willing to give honest appraisals of their distant past. One key claim that elite academics are not willing to give up on is this: The people that academics now most celebrate with jobs, funding, publication, and publicity are in fact the people today who future folks centuries later, carefully considering the question, are most likely to identify as the people today who should have been listened to most for the purpose of speeding intellectual progress. Just as we can sometimes we can get auditors, judges, juries, and even journalists to give honest independent appraisals of others’ acts and accomplishments, there’s a decent chance that we can find a ways to fund “historians” (who might not be professional credentialed as such) to look back carefully at particular areas of research, and rank past researchers in terms of who should have been listened to more. And compound interest over centuries should let us spend lots then on such evaluation, when funded today by only small amounts set aside. The first order of business in this reform effort is to actually fund such efforts to rank researchers from centuries ago, to show that we can in fact robustly enough rank them now. Once we show that diverse approaches give substantially correlated answers, we can search for approaches whose expected results are the most correlated with others, at the lowest cost. (The best way might randomize over many methods.) Once we have demonstrated such a capacity, we could create markets today on assets that pay off proportional to (some monotonic transform of) rankings of current researchers. (Such assets should be built out of assets that accumulate long term value, such as stock index funds.) And we could make markets in such assets conditional on such evaluations being done centuries later on their areas of research. This approach would thus be robust to the fraction of such areas later evaluated. It might be most all such areas, or just a few, depending on how much funding becomes available, how far in the future evaluations are done, and how cheap they end up being. With market estimates of future rankings of current researchers, we could then highlight contrasts between such rankings and the people who academic elites now choose to celebrate, via jobs, funding, publications, etc. Such elites would then have to either (A), dismiss such markets as ignorant, (B) change their choices to better align with market estimates, or (C) trade in these markets to make market estimates better match their non-market choices.","So, patrons are not allies, because they don’t understand the power of academic prestige. Fourth, I considered the possibility of using the media. I thought that maybe, if we could get the media to show more of the negative side of academia, it might help. But media, in their current state, don’t want to do that. They are content to just report on what the academics say, or even to help them. So, media is not an ally either. Fifth, I considered the idea of using the military and government. But I think that the military and government are already quite dependent on academia for their science and technology. So that’s not helpful. Sixth, I considered the possibility of using the academic community itself. That is, maybe we could get some of the academics who are not part of the elite to work with us. But I think that the academic elite has been so successful in making the academic community into a sort of insular, self-reinforcing system that even the non-elite members are too inured to the problems. They are too used to the status quo to want to change it. Seventh, I considered the possibility of using the “outside” of academia. That is, maybe the people who are not in academia could help us. But I think that those people are too often either too naive or too aligned with academia, and don’t have the resources to challenge it. So, potential allies are not helping. So, I have to find a different approach. What is the problem? What is the solution?

I think the problem is that academia has become a closed, self-reinforcing system, in which the elite control the prestige, and thus control the resources. The solution is to find a way to get the system to change its way of allocating resources. That is, instead of the elite controlling the distribution of resources (prizes, grants, publication prestige, etc.) via their control of prestige, we have to find a way",491,500,333,0.1298,0.2053,0.9747,0.9001,0.6601,0.765,9.537,-4.3519,0.3225,0.3004,0.0192,0.0284,0.0,0.0012,0.5751,0.5088,0.9587,0.9286,0.37653239929947463,0.4052173913043478,0.46954314720812185,6,6,0.9578,0.9948,0.13238289205702647,0.13,0.16216216216216217,0.9056,0.6278,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Response to Scott Alexander on Medical Effectiveness.txt,"Scott Alexander on Wednesday:
I’ve spent fifteen years not responding to [Hanson’s medicine] argument, because I worry it would be harsh and annoying to use my platform to beat up on one contrarian who nobody else listens to. But I recently learned Bryan Caplan also takes this seriously. Beating up on two contrarians who nobody else listens to is a great use of a platform! What claim of mine does he dispute? Robin Hanson of Overcoming Bias more or less believes medicine doesn’t work. This is a strong claim. It would be easy to round Hanson’s position off to something weaker, like “extra health care isn’t valuable on the margin”. This is how most people interpret the studies he cites. Still, I think his current, actual position is that medicine doesn’t work. Scott then quotes 500 words from a 2022 post of mine, none of which have me saying all medicine is useless on all margins. Even so, he repeats this claim several times in his post. Now I agree that the analogies I chose in the two places he quotes me, to casinos and to old medicine, were not to cases where there’s clearly much difference between marginal and average effects. But analogies don’t have to be the same in all features to be useful. Those analogy choices may have misled Scott. If so, I’m sorry. But I think I’ve been clear elsewhere. Such as in our 2016 book The Elephant in the Brain:
Our ancestors had reasons to value medicine apart from its therapeutic benefits. But medicine today is different in one crucial regard: it’s often very effective. Vaccines prevent dozens of deadly diseases. Emergency medicine routinely saves people from situations that would have killed them in the past. Obstetricians and advanced neonatal care save countless infants and mothers from the otherwise dangerous activity of childbirth. The list goes on. …
We will now look to see if people today consume too much medicine. … we’re going to step back and examine the aggregate relationship between medicine and health. … We’re also going to restrict our investigation to marginal medical spending. It’s not a question of whether some medicine is better than no medicine—it almost certainly is—but whether, say, $7,000 per year of medicine is better for our health than $5,000 per year, given the treatment options available to us in developed countries.…
[Re] the medicine consumed in high-spending regions but not consumed in low-spending regions, … the research is fairly consistent in showing that the extra medicine doesn’t help. … Still, these are just correlational studies, leaving open the possibility that some hidden factors are influencing the outcomes. … To really make a strong case, then, we need to turn to the scientific gold standard: the randomized controlled study. There’s also my 2007 article Cut Medicine in Half where I say:
In the aggregate, variations in medical spending usually show no statistically significant medical effect on health.","… the tiny effect of medicine found in large studies is in striking contrast to the large apparent effects we find even in small studies of other influences. Obviously, if I thought medicine was useless at all margins, I’d have said to cut it all, not just cut it in half. Scott’s refutation of me focuses on (A) specific evidence suggesting specific treatments help, and (B) aggregate randomized experiments. On (A) specific treatments, he considers cancer and heart attacks. We can more clearly distinguish the effects of medicine by looking at … for example, what percent of cancer patients die in five years? … People with cancer are more likely to survive than fifty years ago. … Some of these changes (especially prostate) are a result of earlier diagnosis. … here’s a graph showing similar survival improvements among childhood cancers in particular, where we wouldn’t expect this to be a problem Odds of death within 30 days of a heart attack have fallen from 20% in 1995 to 12.4% in 2015 … can we dismiss this because maybe heart attack victims are younger? The study this particular graph comes from says their patients were on average 2.7 years older at the end than the beginning. First, my claim of a near zero marginal health gain from more medicine on average is consistent with some particular kinds of medicine having a positive marginal gains. We name some plausible candidates in our book. Cancer and heart attacks could also be among them. Or maybe just childhood cancer. Second, to be relevant to my claim these treatments need to be of the sort that many people get but many others do not. I’m willing to presume that cancer and heart attack treatment fall into this category, but Scott doesn’t show this. Third, Scott is well aware that many others attribute much of these changes to the population getting generally healthier over time, and thus better able at each age to deal with all disease, and also to earlier screening, which catches more cases that would never get very bad. He judges: Although some of this is confounded by improved screening, this is unlikely to explain more than about 20-50% of the effect. The remainder is probably a real improvement in treatment. But he seems well aware that many other specialists judge differently here. On (B) randomized experiments, Scott considers the four that I had mentioned: In a late 1970s RAND Health Insurance Experiment on 7700 people over 3-5 years, those who randomly consumed 30-40% more medicine were no healthier. In a 2008 Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, where for two years 8700 poor folk out of 35,200 eligible were randomly given Medicaid. This raised self-reported health, but mostly before they got any treatment. It cut medical debt. In a 2021 Karnataka Hospital Insurance Experiment, half of 52,300 people were randomly given free (or cheap access) hospital insurance for 3.5 years, which increased their hospital insurance take-up from 60% to 79%. Again, no significant health","…
But in the aggregate, variations in medical spending usually show no statistically significant medical effect on health. …
[The] data is not so clear, but there’s a consistent trend in the data. …
[We] are not saying that medicine is useless. We are saying that in aggregate, medical spending is not associated with better health. …
I think that’s pretty clear. So, I’m not sure what the problem is. If you don’t think that’s the case, then you must be thinking that the medicine we use today is not as effective as the medicine of our ancestors. But I don’t think that’s the case either. So, what’s going to be the solution? The only solution I can think of is to find a way to make medicine more effective. But I don’t think that’s the case. So, what’s the solution? The only solution I can think of is to find a way to make medicine more effective. But I don’t think that’s the case. So, what’s the solution?

The only solution I can think of is to find a way to make medicine more effective. But I don’t think that’s the case. So, Scott, I’m not sure what the problem is. Maybe I should be more clear.

Robin Hanson,Forager Mating Returns.txt,"Based on Bryan’s recommendation, I’ve been reading the excellent Promises I Can Keep (quotes below), an ethnography of mating patterns among poor folks in Philadelphia. I greatly respect ethnographies, and intend to read more of them (suggestions welcome). Bryan summarizes the book as saying:
Poverty isn’t about money; it’s a state of mind. That state of mind is low conscientiousness. But that doesn’t seem quite right to me – the situation is better summarized as the poor having different social norms on appropriate kinds of romantic commitment. Yes these norms may promote and be better matched to low conscientiousness, but even so it is the norms that are the direct effect. Let me explain. All societies have romantic/sexual pair-bonds, i.e., pairs of people with a special distinguished relation. But societies vary in their types and levels of commitment. Consider these options:
We see each other recently more often than do random pairs. We act as if we expect our relation to be exclusive. We act as if we expect our relation to last a long time. We tell associates that we expect a long/exclusive relation, and will be embarrassed if we are seen to be wrong. We invest in shared kids, friends, habits which are degraded if we split. We spent lots on a feast/ceremony to signal our long/exclusive relation, and can’t afford to do that again for a long time. Our community will see us as immoral and somewhat shame us if we split. We invest in relationship-specific capital that is degraded if we split, such as housing or a division of labor. We have transferable assets held hostage that we forfeit if we leave. Our community will use force to prevent one of us from leaving, if the other asks. Societies vary in which types of commitment they see as fitting when. Traditional farming cultures have used all of these ways to bond couples together. In contrast, traditional forager cultures typically only used levels #1,2 while young, and then added in only #3,4,5 when older. They didn’t use the rest. The lower class US culture described in Promises I Can Keep have mostly reverted back to forager ways. When young they basically only use #1,2, and eagerly have kids in that mode, which adds some of #5. When older they often formally marry which adds #3,4,5,6,7, but not #8,9,10. This is all done on purpose. When young they talk explicitly about wanting kids but not wanting to be tied to a particular partner, so they can switch when the mood strikes them. They see marriage as a way to brag about life success, which must await their achieving most of their life goals, including a house, career success, etc. Usually men push for marriage, and women resist. Before marriage, women enjoy pretty complete control over kids. Upper class US culture, in contrast, has a youthful dating period with only #1,2 but expects kids to wait for marriage which adds #3,4,5,6,7.","This culture still has elements of #8,9,10, but those are increasingly disapproved, and this culture is moving away from those. So our entire culture has been moving from farmer toward forager norms as we’ve become richer, but the richer among us are those whose norms have moved slower in that direction. This is understandable if some people and subcultures more strongly feel the social pressures that made foragers into farmers, and if farming norms and styles tend to cause more wealth today. The obvious near term prediction is that as wealth continues to increase, we’ll see a continuing move toward forager mating habits and norms within all classes. Those promised quotes: “In the beginning, when you first like a guy a lot, oh, you want to have his baby.” … Nearly everyone knows that a young man who proclaims his desire to have a baby by a young woman is offering high tribute to her beauty. … The heady significance of the declaration “I want to have a baby by you” is also ruled by the extraordinary high social value the poor place on children. … Poor youth … often begin to eagerly anticipate children and the social role of parents at a remarkably tender age. … The desire to conceive can become so compelling that some young couples begin trying as soon as they feel it is minimally feasible to care for a child. … Now forty-seven, this African American mother of two growth children and a twelve year old remembers vividly how her mother wanted her to get a diploma first and “live her life.” “But to me,” she explains, ‘that [baby] was life!” … Typically, young women describe their pregnancies as “not exactly planned” yet “not exactly avoided” either – as only a few were using any form of conception at all when their “unplanned” child was conceived. …Roughly half of the woman with accidental pregnancies said they were not doing anything too prevent a pregnancy at the time. Yet most know full well the facts of life ands realized that unprotected sex would almost inevitably lead to conception. … Most … believe that it is unjust to penalize an unborn child for its parents’ poor planning, so they nearly always conclude that the “responsible” reaction is to “deal with it” and have the baby rather than seek an abortion. … Virtually no woman we spoke with believed it was acceptable to have an abortion merely to advance an educational trajectory. … Some [men] immediately attempt to deny the child is theirs and accuse their mystified girlfriends of being “cheaters” or “whores.” … Though young women usually claim their boyfriends’ accusations are completely groundless, youth in these neighborhoods do move quickly form one relationship to another, and the rapid onset of sex means there is sometimes legitimate reason for doubt. … The sexual mistrust that is so palpable in the relationships of many poor couples fuels both women’s suspicions and men’s possessiveness. … The mother will retain","They use a lot of #8,9,10 (e.g., social and legal enforceability of marriage). So, the problem in the poor class is that they have a different norm system that is more flexible and less binding. That is, they have a different system of social norms that make their romantic relationships less binding than the ones in the upper class. Thus, the problem isn’t that the poor are low conscientiousness, but that they have different social norms that make them less likely to be committed to their romantic partners.
This is a really important point. It’s a case for understanding the poor not as lacking certain traits but as having different norms. That is, they are not simply low conscientiousness, but their social norms are different. So the problem is not with them, but with the social norms. Therefore, the solution isn’t to change them, but to change the norms. That is, to promote norms that are more like the upper class ones. But that would mean changing the norms in the poor class, which is not likely to be possible. So, the solution is not to change the poor, but to change the norms that they are under. This is a huge shift in perspective. It is more like a cultural shift, not a character shift. That is, the poor are not inherently less committed, but their social norms make them more likely to be less committed. Thus, the problem is not the poor, but the social norms in which they live. Therefore, the solution is not to change the poor, but to change the norms that they are under. But how?
But the question is not only about the poor. If the norms in a society determine the behaviors of the people, then the same applies to any society. The upper class may have their own social norms that make them more committed. So, the problem is not that the upper class is more committed, but that their norms are different. So, the problem is not",492,500,337,0.1157,0.1303,0.9464,0.9051,0.6217,0.8971,9.3059,-1.5741,0.2936,0.3237,0.0079,0.0451,0.0,0.0096,0.5314,0.6742,0.9609,0.9278,0.41074523396880414,0.3905429071803853,0.5089058524173028,7,5,0.9772,0.9975,0.17073170731707318,0.084,0.1572700296735905,0.8608,0.5891,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Toward Consecrated Capital.txt,"Capitalism is the engine of our world; more than anything else, it is what has made us rich over the last few centuries. It is not just that we are free to trade stuff at market prices. It is also that we have teams who bet huge chunks of capital on risky ventures that attempt big changes to key methods and distributions of production. And that many of our best and most ambitious folks are drawn into such teams, hoping to win big from these gambles. That is the magic combo that has made our world vroom, via rapid adaptation and innovation. We give this powerful engine pretty free rein in most mundane parts of our world, the parts that seem too boring to think about. In such areas, we let capitalists decide what are our products, how and where they are made, how they are priced, how work is divided among organizations, which workers do what, which ones are fired, who gets rich, and how often all of this changes. And in such mundane areas, we overall have seen spectacular progress. But alas, the more interesting and important an area of life seems to us, the less willing we are to let this powerful engine work there. For example, we are revolted by things like prostitution and recreational drugs, and so try to ban them. Resulting in “black markets” which mediate about 13% of GDP in developed nations, and 36% in others. Yes trade happens in black markets, but capitalists are greatly restrained there. Many other areas of life seem to us, in contrast, to be too important, too sacred even, for us to feel comfortable giving capitalists free rein there. And so we instead push to have governments or non-profits to run those areas. In the US today, 10% of (non-black-market) workers are self-employed, 10% work at non-profits, and 14% work for governments. Furthermore a third of those who work at for-profits are at publicly-traded firms, where the power of capitalists is substantially constrained relative to at privately held firms. Thus only 38% of US workers are where capitalists are most free to adapt and innovate. This figure is probably even lower in most other nations. Furthermore, even at the most capitalist firms, government regulations often greatly limit allowed changes. Because most people apparently trust government regulators more than they do non-government certifiers or evaluators. In addition, heavy regulations and high taxes induce us to do a lot of things for ourselves (e.g., cooking and cleaning), instead of paying outsiders to do them. Considering all these factors, my guess is that capitalists today are free to change less than a quarter of what they’d be free to change in a completely capitalist economy. This problem also shows itself in reactions to reform proposals. Over the years I’ve proposed alternative institutions for many important areas of life. Being an economist, my proposals usually include money and capitalists. And that has consistently make many dislike them.","For example, critics often imagine extreme scenarios wherein some hurt others for money, and they aren’t moved by stats showing related acts to be quite rare. It is enough that they can imagine them. Yet most worry little about analogous scenarios that remain quite possible with non-profits or governments. Those they trust; money and capitalists they don’t. The fundamental problem here seems to be our old friend, the sacred: money seems profane. Money doesn’t distinguish sacred from profane. It can be spent to get sacred or profane things, and can be obtained via sacred or profane activities. Which violates our norm that the sacred and profane should be clearly separated. Because of this, we can more easily imagine money inspiring profane motives and acts. Furthermore, the vast inequality that rich capitalists represent seems itself profane, making it especially easily imagine such capitalists acting profanely from profane motives. After all, we often care more about others’ motives than the effectiveness of their actions. To prevent the profane from corrupting the sacred, we often try to restrict how money can be used by non-profits, government, and individuals. For example, for individuals we authorize and limit education, retirement, and health-savings accounts. We like employees to be paid straight salaries and given only promotion incentives, rather than detailed performance incentives. We limit org purposes to a few pre-approved options, and we divide their budgets into many non-mixable “colors of money”. Alas, such limits not only tend to be crude and ad hoc, they also greatly hinder capitalists from adapting and innovating in such areas. Which has led me to wonder: could we somehow change money to avoid the things that most make it seem profane, while still enabling something close to capitalism? And that has led me to the idea of: sacred money. I briefly outlined this idea before. Now let me say more. Here is the key idea: create “sacred banks” that enable consecration of capital: Anyone may “consecrate” any ordinary asset, and thereby commit its value to be used only by sacred ventures to achieve sacred ends. For example, you could take some money to a sacred bank, in trade for which they would give you the same amount of sacred money. You could then take that sacred money to a hospital which is approved by a sacred bank to be a sacred venture. This hospital may (if they choose) accept your sacred money as payment for a sacred hospital service. The hospital uses sacred money to pay its suppliers, such as employees. A surgeon supplier, for example, could take that sacred money to a sacred bank, who would then exchange it back to regular money, if that bank approved of the kind and price of the inputs that this suppliers provided to that sacred venture. In this scenario, the key promise has been kept: the original assets that were made sacred were only used to achieve sacred ends. Except, what if a sacred venture collects more scared money from its customers","Even when they are not necessarily bad, even when they are actually good, they are just not liked. The more “capitalist” my proposals are, the more they are rejected. So, what is the problem here? Why do we not trust capitalist solutions to important problems? Is it that we have a deep-seated dislike for capitalism in general? Or is it that we don’t trust capitalists? Or is it that we have a fear that such solutions will be too exploitative or will harm the poor? Or is it that we are simply not used to such solutions? Or is it something else? This is a puzzle that is worth thinking about. But I don’t have the time to solve it now. Let me just say that I think the problem is that we are too quick to reject proposals that are not based on our own experience. We are too quick to assume that the kind of system we have now is the only possible one. We are too quick to assume that if we would have a more capitalist system, the results would be worse than the current ones. So, for instance, if I propose to have a market for organ donations, and I say that this would result in more people giving organs, and more people receiving them, I will be accused of being “capitalist” and “exploitative.” But if I propose to have a government-run system, which is currently the norm, and I say that it is not working well, I will be accused of being “pessimistic” and “anti-compassionate.” It is also possible that we are not used to such solutions. We are used to being told that the problem is that the market is broken. But we are not used to being told that the problem is that the market is not free enough. So, in this case, the problem is not the market being broken, but the market being too constrained. But I think the key issue is that we are too quick to reject proposals that are",496,500,342,0.1103,0.1062,0.9471,0.9298,0.998,0.9126,0.0357,-1.5833,0.3076,0.3527,0.0242,0.042,0.003,0.0072,0.5389,0.6101,0.9581,0.9532,0.41710296684118675,0.3944636678200692,0.5846153846153846,6,6,0.9865,0.9468,0.15120967741935484,0.14,0.11403508771929824,0.908,0.6457,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Will World Government Rot_.txt,"We have seen a centuries-long increase in the scale and scope of governance, and today we see many forms of global governance. While the literature has so far identified many costs and benefits of global governance, I here suggest that we add one so-far-neglected consideration to the list: rot. While many kinds of systems tend to innovate and grow with time, other kinds of systems tend to rot, decay, and die. We should consider the risks that global governance may increase the rot of our total world system. Global Governance
Over the last millennia, the scale of nations has increased, as has the scope and intensity of governance. Particular governance functions have tended to migrate to larger scales, from local to regional to national to global. At the global level, we have increasingly many organizations with increasing abilities to coordinate policy in many particular areas. In addition to formal organizations like the United Nations and the World Trade Organization, we also see an increasingly strong informal global convergence of policy across many areas, such as regarding pandemics, medicine, finance, schools, nuclear, aviation, telecom, and media. This is plausibly due to an increasingly integrated global community of elites and policy-makers, an integration which makes policy-makers in each nation reluctant to deviate far from global policy consensus. How much wider and stronger might global governance become, and what might be the costs and benefits of such changes? An old literature had identified many relevant factors (Glossop 1993; Alesina & Spolaore 2003; Deudney 2008). On the plus side, larger scale governance allows for wider standardization, and more trade and migration over larger scales. It also allows for more production of larger-scale public goods such as the promotion of innovation, and dealing with global problems such as CO2 warming. Also, global governance can suppress inter-state warfare. On the minus side, however, large scale governance encompasses more diverse places, cultures, and populations, and this diversity is an obstacle to coordination. It suggests more internal conflicts within these global systems, and more difficulty reaching consensus, perhaps even leading to armed rebellion. Also, as the threat of external competition weakens, larger scale political processes become freer to focus on internal conflicts and rent seeking, and governance units become freer to suppress dissent and to entrench themselves. Global governance also becomes a single point of failure for the globe, for example increasing risks of both global suicide and of a global totalitarian regime well-entrenched against resistance. The purpose of this short paper/post is to add one more consideration to this list: rot. The Question of Rot
Some kinds of systems rot and decay, while other kinds grow and improve. To better judge the potential for rot in our total world system, we need to better understand what distinguishes these two kinds of systems. For example, over time whole biospheres like Earth seem to slowly accumulate innovations and to spread into more environmental niches.","But the individual organisms of which such biospheres are made tend to decay and die, after an initial period of growth. Most individual species, adapted to relatively stable environments, may slowly rot, to be outweighed by the few rare species adapted to varied and changing environments, forcing them to abstract and remain flexible. Non-trivial software systems seem to consistently rot and decay (Kruchten et al. 2012; Izurieta & Bieman 2013). Software changes resulting from new features and changing hardware and customer environments tend to be haphazard, resulting in more interdependences between previously relatively modular subsystems. This interdependence makes further changes increasingly expensive, so that the system becomes more inflexible and changes less. While efforts to “refactor” such systems, by streamlining their overall structures, can temporarily increase flexibility, large software systems are almost always eventually discarded, to be replaced by new systems rewritten from scratch. Over time, legal systems seem to similarly become more complex, interdependent, and resistant to change. Sometimes legal systems are “refactored” to increase flexibility, such as when the Roman emperor Justinian arranged for a restructuring and simplification of the Roman legal code. This Justinian code was later adapted by Napolean, who spread it across Europe, after which European conquests spread it across the world. While the rate at which firms die does not seem to depend on age (Daepp 2015), older firms do tend to grow at a lower rate (Hosono et al. 2020). That is, individual firms rot. While industries supplied by many diverse firms seem to consistently grow and innovate, such innovation is greatly reduced when industries are dominated by a very small number of firms (Peneder & Woerter 2014; Delbono & Lambertini 2020). Industry innovation can also be greatly reduced by intrusive and globally coordinate regulations. For example, in the nuclear industry strong regulation has resulting in greatly increasing costs, greatly curtailing its potential (Haas 2019; Hall 2021). Across human history, entire civilizations and empires also seem to consistently rise and then fall, suggesting that empires also rot (Turchin & Nefedov 2009). Will today’s integrated world economy and culture also rot for similar reasons, or will some important difference in today’s world civilization prevent that? Does World Government Rot? So now we reach the crucial question: are our new systems of global governance more like an open field of competition that innovates and grows, as do open industries and biospheres? Or are they more like individual organisms, firms, empires, and software and legal systems, or like overly-concentrated or overly-regulated industries? Which tend to decay and rot. What are the key parameters that determine renewal versus rot, and how can they be mapped onto systems of global governance? And can we identify the safest least-rotting variations to recommend? Is it sufficient to keep such systems very simple and modular, allowing few dependencies? References Alberto Alesina, Enrico Spolaore (2003) The Size of Nations, The MIT Press, November 7. Madeleine I. G. Daepp , Marcus J. Hamilton , Geoffrey B. West and Luís M. A. Bettencourt 2015.","But some systems, such as political systems, have been known to rot, to be corrupted, to be mismanaged, and to become inefficient and self-serving. So, what makes one system rot and another not? What are the characteristics that make a system more or less likely to rot? We need to think about these questions, not only for political systems but for any system. If we can understand these characteristics, we can then identify which systems are more or less likely to rot and what kind of rot we can expect to see in them. Rot is not necessarily a simple matter of corruption or inefficiency, but it may be a more complex and insidious process. For example, even if a system is not corrupt, it can still be rotting if it is not adapting to change. In other words, rot can be a failure to adapt, even if the system is not corrupt. The process of rotting can be slow and subtle, but it is still a significant risk.
Rot can occur in many different systems, including political systems, economic systems, and even social systems. In the case of political systems, rot may manifest as corruption, inefficiency, or the entrenchment of power. In economic systems, rot can be seen as market failures, stagnation, or the inability to adapt to new technologies. In social systems, it may appear as the breakdown of social norms, the erosion of trust, or the decline in social cohesion. The question is, what factors contribute to the rotting of these systems? What are the characteristics that make a system more prone to rot, and what can be done to prevent or mitigate this process?
This is the first part of a longer paper, which will explore the concept of rot in more depth, but for now, the focus is on the question of rot in the context of global governance. The first question is: what is the possibility that global governance might increase the rot in the total world system? The second question is: what",485,500,339,0.2475,0.2808,0.9707,0.9472,0.6761,0.8429,-7.2576,-3.5202,0.3057,0.3216,0.0337,0.0548,0.005,0.0104,0.3724,0.4501,0.9549,0.917,0.33756805807622503,0.30664395229982966,0.46786632390745503,5,5,0.964,0.9715,0.15257731958762888,0.184,0.1504424778761062,0.8187,0.7727,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Incentives Are Not Enough.txt,"Imagine a billionaire kidnapped a random person and said:
Here is a camera, banana, bicycle, sundress, and porcupine; you have one day to, by yourself, make a funny video using them all. I’ll upload it to YouTube, and if it gets “enough” views in the first day, I’ll give you $10B. If not, I’ll kill you and your closest twenty relatives. No, I’m not going to tell you my “enough” threshold. Go. This random person would now have a very strong incentive to produce this video. And yet would most likely fail. Maybe even worse than if you’d just offered them a $1000 reward. The billionaire would be much better off hiring experienced video professions chosen from a competitive market. The lesson: incentives by themselves, even strong ones, can be quite insufficient. Consider another example: political sortition. A big problem with democracy is that each voter has on only a tiny chance to be pivotal, and thus has very little direct incentive to decide well. A possible solution to this is to instead pick random juries of voters to decide things. But alas, while I’d like to see this tried, I’m not very optimistic about it. At least at first, I doubt random juries would pick much different from the usual voters. Though maybe after years of experience, society could learn to use them. For a third example, consider health insurance indemnities, also known as “critical illness insurance”. Here you get paid cash upon a medical diagnosis of a serious illness, cash that you can either keep or spend on a matching medical treatment, at an insurer-negotiated price. This arrangement is designed to avoid the problem that regular “in-kind” insurance can induce patients to accept to-them-free treatments that are beneficial, but not worth their cost. Some say indemnities won’t work as docs would take bribes to over-diagnose, but this is already a common form of insurance, and corrupt over-diagnosis is just as serious a problem in the usual case, where the docs who diagnose you are also the docs paid to treat you. Instead, the main problem seems to be that, at least at first, the cash option doesn’t much influence patient treatment choices. This is suggested by a 2020 study reporting on
two blinded vignette-based survey experiments with 3,000 respondents, randomized to eight clinical vignettes and three insurance types. … Most or all of the spending due to insurance would occur even under an indemnity. While patients chose higher-value treatments more often, and accepted treatments more when they were insured, indemnity versus in-kind insurance didn’t make a significant difference to which treatments patients chose. At least in a survey, few pick money instead of the usual treatments. Yes, maybe people would act different in real life, and maybe a society where indemnity was common would learn to choose cash more often. But at least at first, merely giving patients better incentives re once-in-a-lifetime events doesn’t change much.","As a fourth example, imagine that we tried to predict future events via polls that were strongly incentivized via proper scoring rules, but polls which we asked of everyone and where respondents had to immediately answer, and weren’t warned so they could prepare. While such forecasts might be a bit better than un-incentivized but identical polls, they’d be far worse than well-subsidized prediction markets. In such markets, people self-select to become traders, and they can (a) form org teams, (b) take their time to consider answers, and (c) pick what and when they forecast. Such markets work even better when they repeatedly answer similar questions over many years, resulting in the worse teams losing and going away, while the best learn how to win. The general lesson here is that instead of just wanting people who serve us to have strong incentives, we more want something like capitalism. That is, it is not enough to “pay for results”, i.e., for the people who sit in roles doing key tasks to get more of what they want if they produce better results. Even getting paid a lot more just isn’t that helpful. We more want self-selection into competitions for sitting in such roles, with orgs and not just individuals able to play. Including for-profit orgs. When many such entities compete under substantial incentives over long periods to sit in similar roles doing similar tasks, the world can learn how to do better. For many of our most important tasks, peak performance in our civilization has long looked like this: for-profit orgs sitting in roles where they are paid more cash when they produce better results for customers. Investors compete to find and create good orgs, orgs that are sufficiently free from regulation to explore large spaces of possible products, services, and methods for making and marketing them. Employees and customers have access to sufficiently accurate markers of the costs and gains of alternate offerings to be able to, on average, roughly choose the better options. All of these agents should have substantial incentives, but incentives by themselves are just not enough. For example, my proposed political reform is futarchy, wherein speculators are paid for improving our consensus predictions of the consequences of proposed policies, proposal-consideration time-slots are auctioned, and proposers are paid a cut of market-estimated proposal value. Anyone with sufficient capital can make teams to self-select to compete in these roles of proposers and speculators. Voters need only attend to which election candidates support the outcomes (not policies) they want. My proposed medical reform is to merge health insurance with life, disability, and pain insurance, and have hands-tied third-parties pay extra premiums for extra benefits. Auctions can select the orgs willing to offer fixed insurance packages for the lowest premiums. Any org with sufficient capital can offer such insurance services. Patients need only judge their relative values for cash, life, disability, and pain. My proposed criminal law reform is bounty hunters plus requiring everyone to get a “voucher” who fully","So, the lesson: Incentives by themselves, even if they are strong, can be insufficient. The point is not that incentives are useless, but that they are insufficient. Incentives are not the only thing that matters. In some contexts, especially when it comes to things that happen only once, the incentives are not enough. In that case, you need some kind of norm or culture that encourages the right behavior. The point is not to say that incentives are bad, but that they are not sufficient. So, in the case of the billionaire, the person is likely to have a strong incentive to make the video, but that incentive is not sufficient to make the video funny. So, the problem is that the person is not a professional, and the incentive is not enough to overcome the lack of expertise. Similarly, with the political sortition, the juries are likely to be more motivated, but that doesn’t mean they would make better decisions. Similarly, in the case of health insurance, the incentive to spend money is not enough to overcome the problem that people just don’t want to spend money on treatments. So, the conclusion is that incentives are not sufficient, but they can be part of the solution. So, the author is making a point that even when you have strong incentives, they are not enough on their own. So, in the first case, the person is likely to be able to make a funny video, but not necessarily, since they are not a professional. In the second case, even if the juries are more motivated, they may not be more competent. In the third case, the incentive to spend money is not enough to overcome the problem that people just don’t want to spend money on treatments. The author is making the point that incentives are not sufficient, but that they are still useful. The author is not arguing that incentives are bad, but that they are not enough. So, the conclusion is that incentives can be part of the",488,500,340,0.1377,0.2261,0.9081,0.9596,0.8803,0.9932,2.5741,0.1296,0.2918,0.3696,0.0205,0.0429,0.001,0.0104,0.5817,0.7728,0.9445,0.918,0.37372013651877134,0.38045375218150085,0.5202020202020202,5,3,0.9898,0.9541,0.16188524590163936,0.154,0.14705882352941177,0.9273,0.5638,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,We Moderns Are Status-Mad.txt,"Twelve years ago I posted on how our era is a rare unique “dreamtime” of fast growth, wide cultural integration, and delusional beliefs. But I think I missed a big reason why we have the delusions we do: as we get rich, we each increasingly over-estimate our relative social status. Let me explain. The core idea of evolutionary psychology is that evolution shaped our behaviors to be adaptive in our ancestral environments. That is, we do stuff that gives us more descendants. But because our ancestors only experienced a limited range of environments, we only evolved behavior rules sufficient to induce adaptive behavior in those actual environments. This made our behavior indeterminate in the other new environments which humans have experienced since then. So a re-run of the process of evolution could easily lead to different behaviors in these new environments. That is, human behavior today results not just from adaptation to ancestral environments, but also from the many random ways that evolution happened to encode our behavior in rules. For example, our ancestors needed to drink water to avoid dehydration, but because in their environments water always had the same combination of water smell and water feel, we could have evolved either to check that stuff is water by its smell, or by its feel. If those two water features always go together, and if both methods are just as easy, then this difference won’t make much difference to behavior. We find water, check that it is water, and drink it. But if later we encountered stuff that had water smell but not water feel, or water feel but not water smell, then these two different ways to detect water might lead to very different behaviors. For example, water-smell humans might drink stuff that smells but doesn’t feel like water, while water-feel humans would not drink such stuff. In this post, I want to suggest that much of the “modern” human style which has arisen since the industrial revolution results from a particular way that evolution happened to encode human detection of relative status. This has made human history go surprisingly well in some ways, and surprisngly badly in others. Had evolution happened to have coded our status detection machinery differently, these last few centuries might have played out very differently. And perhaps they did, in alien histories. But before we get into that, let us first see how our status detection methods have shaped the modern human style. Most social animals have status ladders, and humans are no exception. Selfishly optimal animal behavior depends on where an animal sits in such ladders. Thus animals need ways to detect the relative status rank of themselves and potential interaction partners. The same applies to humans, though humans had some new ways to mark and assert status, and so needed some new ways to judge status. My key hypothesis is this: evolution had humans use their absolute income/wealth to judge their relative status.","(I’m talking here about overall status in the larger community, not status relative to particular associates; we have many better clues to judge that.) Yes, this method would work badly in environments where communities varied greatly in average levels of absolute income/wealth. In that case, someone rich might think that they had high relative status, when in fact most everyone in their society was also rich. But before the industrial revolution there were few persistent differences in average income/wealth across societies. Yes, there were temporary famines and pandemics, and so good times and bad, but these periods were short relative to human lifetimes. So until recently absolute wealth, averaged over many years, was in fact a good indicator of relative status. However, for the first time in history the industrial revolution enabled income/wealth to grow faster than did human population, inducing a rapid increase in average income/wealth, an increase that has been continuing for several centuries now. As a result, our status detection systems have severely misfired. They tell us each that, because we are rich, we have high relative status. And the richer we have become, the more severe has been this error. To judge how this has this distorted our behavior, we mainly just need to know how humans had previously evolved to adjust their behavior to relative status. For forager and farmer era humans, what behaviors were more adaptive for the high in status? We can find many such differences. For example, for most social mammals, being higher status protects you more from stressful life events, so that you less often invoke the standard mammal stress response. By not spending on stress, you body invests more in growth and immunity. So higher status primates are less sick, and live longer. Thus this theory predicts that humans came to live much longer after the industrial revolution. You might think that this outcome is also predicted by our being able to afford more medicine, nutrition, clean water, and other public health measures. But in fact these factors do a poor job of explaining the magnitude and steadiness of the mortality fall over the last few centuries. Changes in these other factors have been weaker and less steady than declining mortality. Higher status animals also tend more to be group leaders, and thus to be peacemakers regarding local disputes. Yes, the leaders of a group may manage its disputes with outsiders, and then they may need to act tough. But leaders are supposed to less take sides regarding internal disputes, and more try to resolve them peacefully. That is, they have a wider moral circle, and are more cooperative and pro-social. Thus higher status animals less often pick fights with associates, so they are on average more peaceful. And low status humans are consistently more violent than are high status ones. Thus this theory predicts what we have seen: declining rates of violence and conflict, less war, and widening moral circles. However, even as wars get rare, the fact that","That is, we have evolved to think that our relative status is determined by our absolute income/wealth. But that is a bad way to judge relative status. The reason is that in our ancestral environments, income/wealth was very low, and relative status was determined by a combination of absolute income and the distribution of others’ income. But when we became rich, the distribution of others’ income became relatively less important. So now, when we are rich, we think that we are relatively more powerful and important, but in reality, our relative status is more determined by other factors, such as our behavior, our social skills, and our contributions to society. This is why we have delusions of grandeur. We think that we are more important than we actually are. This is also why we are so bad at judging the relative status of others. We think that someone with a high absolute income is high status, but in reality, that person’s status is more influenced by how their income is distributed in the society, and how their behavior affects others. So, when we are rich, we over-estimate our own relative status, and we over-estimate the relative status of others, and underestimate the relative status of people who are not as rich as us. This is a problem because in the real world, the people who are not as rich as us are the ones who are actually more powerful and important, because they are the ones who are not as rich as us. But this is not our perception. We see them as inferior. And that is why we have a lot of delusions, and why we are so bad at judging people. Let me give a concrete example. Suppose that in a certain country, 100 people are each given a 1 million dollar income, and 1000 people are each given a 100,000 dollar income. Now, the absolute income of the 1 million dollar people is higher, but the",492,500,329,0.2609,0.176,0.9772,0.9377,0.8692,0.9478,-2.7202,-1.0858,0.3589,0.3421,0.0484,0.0529,0.008,0.0107,0.2778,0.4961,0.9697,0.9565,0.39783001808318263,0.3894736842105263,0.5080213903743316,6,7,0.9882,0.9829,0.11585365853658537,0.138,0.1337386018237082,0.8605,0.6619,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Why Be Contrarian_.txt,"While I’m a contrarian in many ways, it think it fair to call my ex-co-blogger Eliezer Yudkowsky even more contrarian than I. And he has just published a book, Inadequate Equilibria, defending his contrarian stance, against what he calls “modesty”, illustrated in these three quotes:
I should expect a priori to be below average at half of things, and be 50% likely to be of below average talent overall; … to be mistaken about issues on which there is expert disagreement about half of the time. …
On most issues, the average opinion of humanity will be a better and less biased guide to the truth than my own judgment. …
We all ought to [avoid disagreeing with] each other as a matter of course. … You can’t trust the reasoning you use to think you’re more meta-rational than average. In contrast, Yudkowsky claims that his book readers can realistically hope to become successfully contrarian in these 3 ways:
0-2 lifetime instances of answering “Yes” to “Can I substantially improve on my civilization’s current knowledge if I put years into the attempt?” …
Once per year or thereabouts, an answer of “Yes” to “Can I generate a synthesis of existing correct contrarianism which will beat my current civilization’s next-best alternative, for just myself. …
Many cases of trying to pick a previously existing side in a running dispute between experts, if you think that you can follow the object-level arguments reasonably well and there are strong meta-level cues that you can identify. … [This] is where you get the fuel for many small day-to-day decisions, and much of your ability to do larger things. Few would disagree with his claim #1 as stated, and it is claim #3 that applies most often to reader lives. Yet most of the book focuses on claim #2, that “for just myself” one might annually improve on the recommendation of our best official experts. The main reason to accept #2 is that there exist what we economists call “agency costs” and other “market failures” that result in “inefficient equilibria” (which can also be called “inadequate”). Our best experts don’t try with their full efforts to solve your personal problems, but instead try to win the world’s somewhat arbitrary games. Games that individuals just cannot change. Yudkowsky may not be saying anything especially original here about how broken the world can be, but his discussion is excellent, and I hope it will be widely read. Yudkowsky gives some dramatic personal examples, but simpler examples can also make the point. For example, one can often use maps or a GPS to improve on official road signs saying which highway exits to use for particular destinations, as sign officials often placate local residents seeking less through-traffic.","Similarly, official medical advisors tend to advise medical treatment too often relative to doing nothing, official education experts tend to advise education too often as a career strategy, official investment advisors suggest active investment too often relative to index funds, and official religion experts advise religion too often relative to non-religion. In many cases, one can see plausible system-level problems that could lower the quality of official advice, inducing these experts to try harder to impress and help each other than to help clients. To explain how inadequate are many of our equilibria, Yudkowsky contrasts them with our most adequate institution: competitive speculative financial markets, where it is kind of crazy to expect your beliefs to be much more accurate than are market prices. He also highlights the crucial importance of competitive meta-institutions, for example lamenting that there is no place on Earth where one can pay to try out arbitrary new social institutions. (Alas he doesn’t endorse my call to fix much of the general problem of disagreement via speculative markets, especially on meta topics. Like many others he seems more interested in bets as methods of personal virtue than as institution solutions.) However, while understanding that systems are often broken can lead us to accept Yudkowsky’s claim #2 above, that doesn’t obviously support his claim #3, nor undercut the modesty that he disputes. After all, reasonable people could just agree that, by acting directly and avoiding broken institutions, individuals can often beat the best institutionally-embedded experts. For example, individuals can gain by investing more in index funds, and by choosing less medicine, school, and religion than experts advise. So the existence of broken institutions can’t by itself explain why disagreement exists, nor why readers of Yudkowsky’s book should reasonably expect to consistently pick who is right among disagreeing experts. Thus Yudkowsky needs more to argue against modesty, and for his claim #3. Even if it is crazy to disagree with very adequate financial institutions, and not quite so crazy to disagree with less adequate institutions, that doesn’t imply that it is actually reasonable to disagree with anyone about anything. His book says less on this topic, but it does say some. First, Yudkowsky accepts my summary of the rationality of disagreement, which says that agents who are mutually aware of being meta-rational (i.e., trying to be accurate and getting how disagreement works) should not be able to foresee their disagreements. Even when they have very different concepts, info, analysis, and reasoning errors. If you and a trusted peer don’t converge on identical beliefs once you have a full understanding of one another’s positions, at least one of you must be making some kind of mistake. Yudkowsky says he has applied this result, in the sense that he’s learned to avoid disagreeing with two particular associates that he greatly respects. But he isn’t much inclined to apply this toward the other seven billion humans on Earth; his opinion of their meta-rationality seems low. After all, if they were as","In such cases, the official policy is not in the interest of the individual. The same is true for many other policies and systems, such as school districts, where officials often try to preserve the status quo rather than optimize for the best education for the individual child. So, the claim is that the official systems and institutions that are supposed to help people are actually not in the interest of the individual, and that we should be contrarians in order to find better solutions. So, the book is about how to be a contrarian, but not in the sense of being a contrarian for the sake of being contrarian. Instead, it is a contrarianism that is motivated by a desire to find better solutions to problems that the current systems are not solving. However, the book is not just about how to be contrarian. The book is also about how to be a better contrarian, by improving on the current state of contrarianism. The author is not just a contrarian, but a contrarian who is trying to be a better contrarian. That is, he is not just someone who is doing contrarian things, but is trying to improve the art of contrarianism. And this is where the book is most interesting. So, for instance, he says that in the past, the contrarian approach has been to be “unconvinced by arguments” (i.e., to reject the argument as soon as you see it). But that is a flawed approach. Instead, the author proposes a more refined method of contrarianism: “contrarianism is not the rejection of arguments, but the rejection of the argument for the wrong reasons.” So, if you see an argument that you think is wrong, you should not just reject it, but you should find out why it is wrong. So, this is an important point. The author is not saying that you should reject all arguments, but that you should be able to reject an argument for the right",459,500,331,0.2401,0.1985,0.9834,0.8987,0.8924,0.6686,-2.9692,-9.1438,0.38,0.3494,0.0384,0.0421,0.0022,0.0013,0.5413,0.6213,0.9765,0.9566,0.4088397790055249,0.39482758620689656,0.5478723404255319,6,6,0.9612,0.9261,0.12200435729847495,0.132,0.13293051359516617,0.8864,0.5724,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,AGI Is Sacred.txt,"Sacred things are especially valuable, sharply distinguished, and idealized as having less decay, messiness, inhomogeneities, or internal conflicts. We are not to mix the sacred (S) with the non-sacred (NS), nor to trade S for NS. Thus S should not have clear measures or money prices, and we shouldn’t enforce rules that promote NS at S expense. We are to desire S “for itself”, understand S intuitively not cognitively, and not choose S based on explicit calculation or analysis. We didn’t make S; S made us. We are to trust “priests” of S, give them more self-rule and job tenure, and their differences from us don’t count as “inequality”. Objects, spaces, and times can become S by association. (More)
When we treat something as sacred, we acquire the predictably extreme related expectations and values characteristic of our concept of “sacred”. This biases us in the usual case where such extremes are unreasonable. (To min such biases, try math as sacred.)
For example, most ancient societies had a great many gods, with widely varying abilities, features, and inclinations. And different societies had different gods. But while the ancients treated these gods as pretty sacred, Christians (and Jews) upped the ante. They “knew” from their God’s recorded actions that he was pretty long-lasting, powerful, and benevolent. But they moved way beyond those “facts” to draw more extreme, and thus more sacred, conclusions about their God. For example, Christians came to focus on a single uniquely perfect God: eternal, all-powerful, all-good, omnipresent, all-knowing (even re the future), all-wise, never-changing, without origin, self-sufficient, spirit-not-matter, never lies nor betrays trust, and perfectly loving, beautiful, gracious, kind, and pretty much any other good feature you can name. The direction, if not always the magnitude, of these changes is well predicted by our sacredness concept. It seems to me that we’ve seen a similar process recently regarding artificial intelligence. I recall that, decades ago, the idea that we could make artificial devices who could do many of the kinds of tasks that humans do, even if not quite as well, was pretty sacred. It inspired much reverence, and respect for its priests. But just as Christians upped the ante regarding God, many recently have upped the AI ante, focusing on an even more sacred variation on AI, namely AGI: artificial general intelligence. The default AI scenario, the one that most straightforwardly projected past trends into the future, would go as follows. Many kinds of AI systems would specialize in many different tasks, each built and managed by different orgs. There’d also be a great many AI systems of each type, controlled by competing organizations, of roughly comparable cost-effectiveness. Overall, the abilities of these AI would improve at roughly steady rates, with rate variations similar to what we’ve seen over the last seventy years. Individual AI systems would be introduced, rise in influence for a time, and then decline in influence, as they rotted and become obsolete relative to rivals.","AI systems wouldn’t work equally well with all other systems, but would instead have varying degrees of compatibility and integration. The fraction of GDP paid for such systems would increase over time, and this would likely lead to econ growth rate increases, perhaps very large ones. Eventually many AI systems would reach human level on many tasks, but then continue to improve. Different kinds of system abilities would reach human level at different times. Even after this point, most all AI activity would be doing relatively narrow tasks. The upped-ante version of AI, namely AGI, instead changes this scenario in the direction of making it more sacred. Compared to AI, AGI is idealized, sharply distinguished from other AI, and associated with extreme values. For example: 1) Few discussions of AGI distinguish different types of them. Instead, there is usually just one unspecialized type of AGI, assumed to be at least as good as humans at absolutely everything. 2) AGI is not a name (like “economy” or “nation”) for a diverse collection of tools run by different orgs, tools which can all in principle be combined, but not always easily. An AGI is instead seen as a highly integrated system, fully and flexibly able to apply any subset its tools to any problem, without substantial barriers such as ownership conflicts, different representations, or incompatible standards. 3) An AGI is usually seen as a consistent and coherent ideal decision agent. For example, its beliefs are assumed all consistent with each other, fully updated on all its available info, and its actions are all part of a single coherent long-term plan. Humans greatly deviate from this ideal. 4) Unlike most human organizations, and many individual humans, AGIs are assumed to have no internal conflicts, where different parts work at cross purposes, struggling for control over the whole. Instead, AGIs can last forever maintaining completely reliable internal discipline. 5) Today virtually all known large software systems rot. That is, as they are changed to add features and adapt to outside changes, they gradually become harder to usefully modify, and are eventually discarded and replaced by new systems built from scratch. But an AGI is assumed to suffer no such rot. It can instead remain effective forever. 6) AGIs can change themselves internally without limit, and have sufficiently strong self-understanding to apply this ability usefully to all of their parts. This ability does not suffer from rot. Humans and human orgs are nothing like this. 7) AGIs are usually assumed to have a strong and sharp separation between a core “values” module and all their other parts. It is assumed that value tendencies are not in any way encoded into the other many complex and opaque modules of an AGI system. The values module can be made frozen and unchanging at no cost to performance, even in the long run, and in this way an AGI’s values can stay constant forever. 8) AGIs are often assumed to be very skilled, even perfect, at cooperating with","There would be a few very advanced AI systems, but they’d be limited in scope and not as powerful as human-level intelligence. But now, people are moving toward a more sacred view of AI, one where AGI is not just a possibility but a certainty, and one where AGI would be so powerful that it would be able to do anything, including everything that a human can do, and perhaps even more. And once AGI is created, it would be so powerful that it would be able to do anything, including everything that a human can do, and perhaps even more. And once AGI is created, it would be so powerful that it would be able to do anything, including everything that a human can do, and perhaps even more. (More)
So, in the past, people treated the concept of “God” as sacred, and from that, they built a very extreme, extreme version of the concept. Similarly, people now are treating the concept of “AI” as sacred, and from that, they are building a very extreme, extreme version of the concept. In both cases, the sacred concept is more extreme than the normal, non-sacred concept. The sacred concept is more extreme in the sense that it is more idealized, less messy, more perfect, and more absolute. The sacred concept is not something that can be measured or priced, and it is not something that can be traded off against the non-sacred. It is something that is to be desired for itself, not for its utility or other pragmatic considerations. It is something that is to be understood intuitively, not through explicit calculation or analysis. It is something that is to be trusted, not to be questioned or scrutinized. It is something that is to be given more self-rule and job tenure, even if that means that the priests of the sacred concept may have more power or authority than the people who are not part of the sacred concept. It is something that is",492,500,334,0.2379,0.2783,0.9609,0.9242,0.9517,0.8117,-0.9501,4.5604,0.3659,0.3506,0.0322,0.0537,0.0049,0.0082,0.2579,0.3087,0.9425,0.9322,0.3505654281098546,0.35800344234079173,0.5207253886010362,4,5,0.953,0.9828,0.22967479674796748,0.148,0.1497005988023952,0.9402,0.5033,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,An Alien War Nightmare.txt,"Grabby aliens are advanced civs who change the stuff they touch in big visible ways, and who keep expanding fast until they meet each other. Our recent analysis suggests that they appear at random stars roughly once per million galaxies, and then expand at roughly half the speed of light. Right now, they have filled roughly half of the universe, and if we join them we’ll meet them in roughly a billion years. There may be far more quiet than grabby alien civs out there, but those don’t usually do much or last long, and even the ruins of the nearest are quite far away. While I’ve so far avoided thinking about much war within this scenario, I’ve decided to go there now. So here we go. First, consider quiet alien wars. Such quiet civs may have internal wars, but different civs rarely get close enough to each other for physical fights. Maybe more advanced ones would sometimes conquer less advanced ones via malicious messages, but I’m skeptical that such events are common. The rare civs who expanded long and quietly mainly to preserve a natural universe and prevent grabby origins within their sphere of control should share goals and thus have little reason to war when they meet. Furthermore, when grabby civs meet quiet ones, abilities would be terribly unequal, and so not much of an occasion for war. What about grabby civs? After a few million years they’d probably reach near max possible tech abilities. Which I guess makes them pretty immune to malicious messages. But such civs and their parts might vary in how well they had used a shared origin to promote internal cooperation. And a lack of perfect cooperation would likely result in some internal wars. The higher the rate at which they spend a fraction of their fast-access resources to fight or prevent fights, the faster they’d use up such resources. As a result, such fast spending civs might only get resources for a long time if some of their resource sources, like black holes, only allowed slow extraction. Long-distance ballistic directed energy weapons, which couldn’t be redirected along the way, would only be of use on targets whose locations could be predicted long enough in advance. As a result, grabby cis would usually ensure that the locations of important resources vulnerable to such attacks could not be so predicted. Similarly, they’d end or stay away from objects like stars that might be induced to explode by outside prods. Thus militarily-useful resources would likely need to maintain unpredictable locations and would need to be located quite close to where they’d be used. So conflicts would tend to be won locally by those with more military resources locally available near the point of conflict. If grabby civs are not more able to or inclined to cooperate internally than with other civs, then each small part of such a civ should be similarly wary of neighboring advanced life, regardless of its civ of origin.","In which case, the boundary at which different grabby civs meet might not have that much significance. Who wins each local conflict would mainly depend on their relative size, resources, level of internal cooperation, and local geography, but not civ of origin. On 100Mlyr and larger scales, this should add up to a pretty uniform picture. However, what if at least some parts of some grabby cigs could use their shared origin to cooperate more strongly internally than they could with other grabby civs? In this case, they’d expect more conflict at the border where grabby civs meet, compared to at other locations. As a result, the cooperating units on both sides might then try to send resources to that border, in anticipation of such conflicts. And then a key question arises: just how fast is it feasible to move militarily useful resources? Grabby civs expanding at half the speed might seem surprisingly fast, but this does seem roughly feasible given that they can afford to spend huge resources on speeding tiny seeds that can then use local resources to quickly grow exponentially into huge civs. Alas, no similar exponential strategy seems available to move resources from one place to another. If the resources required to accelerate resources to near the speed of light can be efficiently recaptured at a designation location, then perhaps resources could in fact be efficiently sent very far very fast. But otherwise, sending resources far fast (e.g., >2% of c) may only be possible at crazy high costs. At the border between two grabby civs, imagine that one of the civs had better managed to tax internal regions to send more resources to that border from within that civ, and at a very rapid speed. In this case, then after a while the resources accumulated on one side of that border might be far larger than that on the other side. Then if the natural advantage of defense over offense were not too large, the stronger side might be able to initiate a war and take territory from the other side. And in fact this outcome might become so obvious that the losing side would be very sure to lose, and not even want to fight. If merely threatening to attack with overwhelming force was usually sufficient to quickly rout the weaker side and win new territory, via induced surrender or flight, or if actual fights did not take too long or destroy too much of an attacker’s resources, then an attacker might continue to move forward into the other side’s territory at a rapid pace. And if that pace were on the order of 2% of the speed of light, that might be sufficient to completely take over all the territory of a neighboring grabby civ within the roughly hundred billion years remaining before the time when, it is now estimated, dark energy makes galaxy clusters disconnected, never more able to see or reach each other. Such attack threats might then be seen as","So the more grabby a civ is, the more likely they are to be aggressive and warlike. Therefore, the greater the risk of war between two civs is, the more grabby one of them is. But even if the risk of war is high, there may be no war if the two civs are not close enough to each other. If they are close enough to each other, then the question is whether they have the resources to wage war. If they have the resources, they will. If not, then they might not. So the more grabby a civ is, the more likely it is to be in a war. Now, considering all of this, what is the probability that a grabby civ will be in a war in the next few billion years? Let's say that we are at the moment when 50% of the universe is filled with grabby civs. If a grabby civ is in a war, then it is likely that the other civ involved in that war is also grabby. So, we can model this as a system where each grabby civ has a certain probability of being in a war, which depends on the density of other grabby civs and their own resources. But how do we quantify this? Let's suppose that the probability of two grabby civs meeting is a function of their distance from each other. If they are far apart, they might not meet. If they are close, they might meet and conflict. The probability of meeting is thus a function of the density of grabby civs. If the density is high, the probability of meeting is higher. So, in a universe where 50% of the space is filled with grabby civs, the probability of two such civs being in proximity is high. But how high? If the universe is expanding, then the distance between two grabby civs would be increasing over time. So the probability of meeting would decrease over",498,500,330,0.3767,0.359,0.9538,0.8477,0.8449,0.7425,3.9083,-5.4821,0.4067,0.3961,0.0568,0.0471,0.0137,0.0113,0.6471,0.6904,0.9677,0.9539,0.39469026548672564,0.4129263913824057,0.5415549597855228,6,6,0.9663,0.987,0.10040160642570281,0.1,0.12424242424242424,0.9117,0.5649,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,How Lumpy AI Services_.txt,"Long ago people like Marx and Engels predicted that the familiar capitalist economy would naturally lead to the immiseration of workers, huge wealth inequality, and a strong concentration of firms. Each industry would be dominated by a main monopolist, and these monsters would merge into a few big firms that basically run, and ruin, everything. (This is somewhat analogous to common expectations that military conflicts naturally result in one empire ruling the world.)
Many intellectuals and ordinary people found such views quite plausible then, and still do; these are the concerns most often voiced to justify redistribution and regulation. Wealth inequality is said to be bad for social and political health, and big firms are said to be bad for the economy, workers, and consumers, especially if they are not loyal to our nation, or if they coordinate behind the scenes. Note that many people seem much less concerned about an economy full of small firms populated by people of nearly equal wealth. Actions seem more visible in such a world, and better constrained by competition. With a few big privately-coordinating firms, in contrast, who knows that they could get up to, and they seem to have so many possible ways to screw us. Many people either want these big firms broken up, or heavily constrained by presumed-friendly regulators. In the area of AI risk, many express great concern that the world may be taken over by a few big powerful AGI (artificial general intelligence) agents with opaque beliefs and values, who might arise suddenly via a fast local “foom” self-improvement process centered on one initially small system. I’ve argued in the past that such sudden local foom seems unlikely because innovation is rarely that lumpy. In a new book-length technical report, Reframing Superintelligence: Comprehensive AI Services as General Intelligence, Eric Drexler makes a somewhat similar anti-lumpiness argument. But he talks about task lumpiness, not innovation lumpiness. Powerful AI is safer if it is broken into many specific services, often supplied by separate firms. The task that each service achieves has a narrow enough scope that there’s little risk of it taking over the world and killing everyone in order to achieve that task. In particular, the service of being competent at a task is separate from the service of learning how to become competent at that task. In Drexler’s words:
Comprehensive AI services (CAIS) provides a model of flexible, general intelligence in which agents are a class of service-providing products, rather than a natural or necessary engine of progress in themselves. … Strongly self-modifying agents lose their instrumental value even as their implementation becomes more accessible, while the likely context for the emergence of such agents becomes a world already in possession of general superintelligent-level capabilities. …
AI deployment today is dominated by AI services such as language translation, image recognition, speech recognition, internet search, and a host of services buried within other services.","… Even applications of AI within autonomous systems (e.g., self-driving vehicles) can be regarded as providing services (planning, perception, guidance) to other system components. … [Service] tasks for advanced AI include: • Modeling human concerns • Interpreting human requests • Suggesting implementations • Requesting clarifications • Developing and testing systems • Monitoring deployed systems • Assessing feedback from users • Upgrading and testing systems CAIS functionality, which includes the service of developing stable, task- oriented AI agents, subsumes the instrumental functionality of proposed self-transforming AGI agents, and can present that functionality in a form that better fits the established conceptual frameworks of business innovation and software engineering. Describing AI systems in terms of functional behaviors (“services”) aligns with concepts that have proved critical in software systems development. These include separation of concerns, functional abstraction, data abstraction, encapsulation, and modularity, including the use of client/server architectures—a set of mechanisms and design patterns that support effective program design, analysis, composition, reuse, and overall robustness. This vision seems built on the 1988 “Agoric computing” vision of Drexler and Mark Miller, which Miller has also built on in his computer security work. That vision is of computing systems with a fine-grain breakdown into service-providing modules with separate resources and property rights. As Peter McCluskey notes, this vision is also related to Drexler’s later nanotech visions: Drexler’s CAIS proposal removes the “self-” from recursive self-improvement, in much the same way that nanofactories removed the “self-” from nanobot self-replication, replacing it with a more decentralized process that involves preserving more features of existing factories / AI implementations. McCluskey is only mildly persuaded: [By] analogies to people … I’m tempted … to conclude that an unified agent AI will be more visionary and eager to improve. … The novelty of the situation hints we should distrust Drexler’s extrapolation from standard software practices (without placing much confidence in any alternative). … He wants humans to decompose [curing Cancer] into narrower goals (with substantial AI assistance), such that humans could verify that the goals are compatible with human welfare (or reject those that are too hard too evaluate). This seems likely to delay cancer cures compared to what an agent AGI would do, maybe by hours, maybe by months, as the humans check the subtasks. … I haven’t thought of a realistic example where I expect the delay would generate a strong incentive for using an agent AGI, but the cancer example is close enough to be unsettling. … Modularity normally makes software development easier … [but] modularity seems less important for ML. I’ve found two other critics of this new report. Rohin Shah: Typically, we’re worried about the setting where the RL [reinforcement learning] agent is learning or planning at test time, which can happen in learn-to-learn and online learning settings, or even with vanilla RL if the learned policy has access to external memory and can implement a planning process separately from the training procedure. … The lesson of deep learning is that if you can do","These services are, in the language of Drexler, “task-locked” in the sense that their functions are narrow and their purposes are clear. In this model, the AI is not a general-purpose intelligence, but rather a collection of specific-purpose AI services that are interconnected in a complex system.
In the context of AI risk, this is a very important point. If the AI is a collection of specific-purpose services, each with narrow, clearly defined functions, it is much less likely that any one of them will have the capacity to cause an existential risk. In particular, if the AI is not a single, self-improving, self-optimizing, self-reflecting, self-organizing, and self-motivated agent, but instead a collection of specific services that are not self-improving, then the AI is safer.
So, the idea is that, if we can have a system of many small, specific-purpose AI services, each of which is not self-improving, then we are more likely to be safe. This is similar to the idea that, if we have many small firms instead of a few big ones, we are more likely to be safe. Both cases rely on the idea that small, specific, and non-self-improving entities are less dangerous.
But wait a minute. If a system is made up of many small, specific-purpose AI services, then what happens if these services become self-improving? Is that a risk? Or, if a service becomes self-improving, does it become a self-improving agent, and then is it a risk? Or is the system a collection of services that are not self-improving, and then they can be made self-improving, but not by themselves? For example, if a service is not self-improving, but is developed by a company that is self-improving, then is that a risk?

Robin Hanson,Cook’s Critique of Our Earliness Argument.txt,"Tristan Cook has posted an impressive analysis, “Replicating and extending the grabby aliens model.” We are grateful for his detailed and careful work. Cook’s main focus is on indexical inference, showing how various estimates depend on different approaches to indexical analysis. But he has an appendix, ‘Updating n on the time remaining”, wherein he elaborates a claim that some of our analysis is “problematic”, “a possible error”, is “incompatible” with his, and that
“These results fail to replicate Hanson et al.’s (2021) finding that (the implicit use of) SSA implies the existence of GCs in our future.”
In this post I respond to that critique. Cook quotes our claim:
If life on Earth had to achieve n “hard steps” to reach humanity’s level, then the chance of this event rose as time to the n-th power. Integrating this over habitable star formation and planet lifetime distributions predicts >99% of advanced life appears after today, unless n < 3 and max planet duration <50Gyr. That is, we seem early. He also replicates this key diagram of ours:
This shows that humanity looks very early unless we have a low value of either n (the number of hard steps needed to create advanced life like us) or Lmax (max habitable planet duration). We suggest that this be explained via a grabby-aliens-fill-the-universe deadline coming soon, though we admit that either very low n or very low Lmax are other possible explanations. But Cook claims instead that “large n and large Lmax … are incompatible.” Why? He offers a simple Bayesian model with a uniform prior over n, equal numbers of two types of planets all born at the same time with lifetimes of 5 and 100 billion years, and updating on the fact that humans appeared on one of these planets after 4.5 billion years. He shows (correctly) that the Bayesian posterior then overwhelmingly favors n=1, with almost no weight on n>2. But this seems to me to just repeat our point above, that without a grabby aliens deadline one needs to assume either low n or low Lmax. If you allow large Lmax with no deadline, that will force you to conclude low n; no surprise. (Also, it seems to me that all of Cook’s n estimates do not update on all of the varied evidence that has led other authors to estimate higher n.)
The body of Cook’s paper describes a much more elaborate Bayesian model, a model which includes the deadline effect. And the posteriors on Lmax there also very strongly favor low Lmax, for all the indexical reasoning cases that he considers. Does this show that Lmax is “incompatible” with large n? No, because this result is easily attributed to the fact that his prior on Lmax strongly favors both low n and low Lmax. Cook considers three priors on n, with medians of 0,1,3. And while he allows Lmax to range from 5 to 20,000 Gyr, the median of his prior is ~10 Gyr.","Even though actual median planet lifetime is 5,000 Gyr. An analysis that won’t allow large Lmax or large n can’t tell us is those two are compatible. Note that the priors in Cook’s main Bayesian analysis are not designed to express great ignorance, but instead designed to agree with estimates from several prior papers that Cook likes. So Cook’s main priors exclude the possibilities that grabby alien civs might expand slowly, or that there are a great many non grabby civs for each grabby one. And he tunes his prior to ensure a median of exactly one intelligent civilization per observable universe volume. However, in another appendix of Cook’s paper, “Varying the prior on Lmax”, he also considers a wider prior on Lmax. (He retains all his other prior choices, including a prior on n with median 1.) Namely a lognormal with a median of 500 Gyr and a one sigma range of 110 to 2200 Gyr. His posterior from this has a median Lmax of 7Gyr, and a 90th percentile at ~100 Gyr. Which means that compared to Cook’s prior on Lmax, his posterior has substantially lower values of Lmax. Does this prove his claim that high Lmax is incompatible with high n? I think not, because 60% of this posterior is on cases with less than one grabby civ per observable universe volume, and it takes a much higher density of such civs to create a grabby aliens deadline effect. Look, the fact that we now find ourselves on a planet that has only lasted for 4.5Gyr should boost low Lmax hypotheses in two ways. The first, and weaker effect, is that the lower is Lmax, the fewer planets there are below Lmax, and thus the higher becomes the prior on our particular planet. This is a count effect, which boosts our planet’s posterior by a factor of ten for every factor of one hundred by which Lmax falls. As the total dynamic range of Lmax under consideration here is a factor of 4000, that’s a real but modest effect. The second effect is much larger. Without a grabby aliens deadline effect, then for n=1 a planet that lasts for 4000 times longer becomes 4000 times more likely to birth an intelligent civilization. For n=2, it becomes eight million times more likely. And this factor gets even bigger for larger n. Thus observing that we appear on a planet that has lasted only 4.5Gyr can force a huge additional update toward lower Lmax. Without a deadline, that’s the only way to explain how we appear on such a short lived planet if there is no grabby aliens deadline. This strong effect plausibly explains the strong Lmax updating effects we see in Cook’s wider Lmax prior analysis, as most of the posterior weight there is on scenarios with no deadline effect. Bottom line: I happily admit there is a count effect that prefers lower Lmax in a posterior compared to a prior. But this effect is weak; a factor","So, the prior is actually not that different from the uniform prior in our paper. But the key difference is that in his model, the deadline is not taken into account in the prior. In our paper, the deadline is included in the prior. So, when he updates with the fact that humans appear early, the result is that the prior on Lmax is updated to be much lower, and this is the reason for the discrepancy. Therefore, if we had used a prior on Lmax that included the deadline, then the posterior would be the same as in our paper, and there would be no contradiction.
So, I think that Cook is not right in claiming that large Lmax is incompatible with large n. Instead, the issue is that the prior in Cook’s analysis does not include the deadline. So, his analysis is not in conflict with our analysis, and in fact, in his model, the deadline is included, and that is the reason that his results are different.
But there is a possible issue. If we include the deadline in the prior, then we might have to assume that the deadline is a known parameter, which is not the case. In our paper, we don’t assume the deadline is a known parameter. But that is a different issue. It is a question of how the prior should be constructed. However, I think that the deadline should be included in the prior, if we are to do a proper Bayesian analysis, as it is a key part of the model. So, if you don't include it in the prior, then you can't really claim that the posterior is different from our analysis.
Therefore, I think that Cook's critique is not valid, and that our analysis is correct.
So, the answer to the question ""Is the claim that large n and large Lmax are incompatible with the analysis in the paper?"" is ""No, it is not incompatible, because the prior in Cook's analysis does not include the deadline, which is a",496,500,341,0.4103,0.3077,0.9898,0.9457,0.935,0.945,-1.3259,-1.1222,0.4159,0.41,0.0612,0.0713,0.0137,0.0179,0.5505,0.4139,0.9661,0.9255,0.3732876712328767,0.3905429071803853,0.535175879396985,8,5,0.9595,0.9227,0.14112903225806453,0.104,0.15835777126099707,0.8669,0.6193,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Prestige in US Today.txt,"Lauren A. Rivera’s Pedigree: How Elite Students Get Elite Jobs is a depressing book because it tells how the world works:
Pedigree takes readers behind the closed doors of top-tier investment banks, consulting firms, and law firms to reveal the truth about who really gets hired for the nation’s highest-paying entry-level jobs, who doesn’t, and why. A big % of graduates of elite colleges take such jobs, and the other jobs they take don’t make nearly as much money. The other big employers, such as hedge funds, private equity firms, and tech firms, choose similarly. And elite colleges use similar criteria to pick their students. So this is a window into how we pick a big % of the top elites in the US today. While I often assume that prestige is a big driver of human behavior, my poll respondents hardly admitted to putting much weight on prestige when picking experts. And many complain that I put too much emphasis on the concept. However, these elite employers strongly confirm my view, as they focus overwhelmingly on prestige when picking junior employees. They only recruit at the most elite colleges, and they want recruits to be attractive, energetic, articulate, socially smooth, and have had elite personal connections, jobs, and extracurriculars. They don’t that much care about your grades, what you’ve learned, or what you did in your jobs or extracurriculars, as long as they were prestigious. I noticed several interesting patterns worth pondering. For example, employers have little patience with candidates who didn’t pick the most prestigious possible college or job, but were swayed by other considerations. Such as topics of interest, limited money, or the needs of a spouse or family. A “serious” person always picks max prestige. Always. Yet for extracurriculars, you are not supposed to connect those to your career plans, as “nerds” do. You must instead do something with no practical value, but that is prestigious. Like varsity athletes in lacrosse or crew, sports that are too expensive for ordinary folks to pursue. Excess interest in ideas marks you as a “boring” “tool”. An interesting criteria is that you must tell a mesmerizing story about your life, a story told almost entirely in terms of choices that you made to pursue your internal goals, without external constraints having much influence. And even though you have been chosen for your very consistent lifetime pursuit of prestige, that is very much not allowed to be one of your main goals. You were instead pursuing other goals, and prestige just happened as a side effect. Lucky you. The author convincingly argues that this is not that much of a “meritocracy”, in that the features sought are much easier for elite parents to promote in their kids, and many of them are not actually that useful to society. But it does look like an equilibrium, in the sense that firms who picked differently would probably be punished.","It seems that while these firms do sell concrete consulting services to their customers, what they are mostly selling is a prestigious aura around that advice. So firms that hired less prestigious workers would likely be punished. Customers who paid as much for less prestigious advice would probably also be punished, via others being less willing to praise or follow that advice. And so on. All of this seems to fit my experience in academia, where at the highest levels the focus is overwhelming on gaining the endorsement of prestigious schools, journals, jobs, funders, etc. Whether the work you do is useful to society or even accurate is someone else’s job; your job to gain prestige and so you only do those other things if your prestige incentives encourage them. Some of these features that these firms look for probably count for prestige in most any society. Such as looks, energy, intelligence, connections, and social savvy. But in other ways the particular packages of features most sought here now are probably a local equilibrium; other societies have valued different packages. So a crucial question is: to what extent is it possible to move our prestige equilibrium to a different and more useful one? Where say it might be prestigious to actually do something useful for the world. Seems a worthy topic of study. Some book quotes to confirm my claims above: Evaluators frequently adopted an unconstrained view of university enrollment, believing that students typically “go to the best school they got into”. … Failure to attend a super-elite school was an indicator of intellectual failure, regardless of a student;’s grades or standardized test scores. Many evaluators believed that high-achievement students as lessor-ranked institutions (even top fifteen …) … must have slipped up. … In addition to being an indicator of potential intellectual deficits, the decision to go to a lower-ranked school was often interpreted as evidence of moral failings, such as faulty judgement or a lack of foresight on the students part. … even candidates who faced significant financial obstacles to attendance … “should be smart enough to invest in their future.” pp.88-89. Those who participated in [extracurricular] activities that were primarily academically or pre-professionally oriented were perceived to be “boring”, “tool,” “bookworms”, or “nerds” who might turn out to be “corporate drones” if hired. p.93 Across the board, [evaluators] privileged [extracurricular] activities that were motivated by “personal” rather than “professional” interest, even when activities were directly related to work within their industry. This was because evaluators believed that the later types of activities served the instrumental purpose of “looking good” to recruiters, and they viewed them as “resume filler” or “padding” rather than evidence of genuine “passion,” “commitment” and “well-roundedness.” … Evaluators also preferred activities driven by desire and personal passion rather than necessity, such as paid employment or care for family members. p.97 Grades are often distrusted by employers in general. p.101 Most evaluators did not believe that grades were an indicator of intelligence. There was a surprising","So, this is a system that is self-reinforcing, and that is not easy to change. It is a system that is not designed for the public good, but that is designed to reward those who are already in the system. The author also shows that the system is not as exclusive as it seems. For example, some people who are not from elite backgrounds do end up in these elite jobs, and often it is because they are from small towns or “rural” areas, and they were lucky with the right connections. So, the author is not saying that this system is the best, but rather that it is a self-reinforcing, entrenched system that is not easy to change. The author is also not saying that the system is fair, but rather that it is a system that is not fair, and that it is not that much of a meritocracy. The author’s conclusion is that the system is not fair, not a meritocracy, and that it is not easy to change. So, the author is not arguing for a utopia, but rather for a system that is self-reinforcing, entrenched, and not fair. The book is written in a very accessible, even engaging, way, with plenty of examples and anecdotes. The book is written by a professor at a top-tier university, which is very much in line with the author’s thesis that elite universities are not just important for their academic quality, but also for their role in the selection and development of the top-tier elite. The author also gives credit to the system, by saying that it does have some positive aspects, such as the fact that it is a self-reinforcing system, which helps to maintain the quality of the system, and that it is a system that rewards those who are already in the system. The book is not a call for revolution, but rather a call for understanding and awareness of the system.

Robin Hanson,"AI Risk, Again.txt","Large language models like ChatGPT have recently spooked a great many, and my Twitter feed is full of worriers saying how irresponsible orgs have been to make and release such models. Because, they say, such a system might have killed us all. And, as some researchers say that they are working on how to better control such things, worriers say we must regulate to slow/stop AI progress until such researchers achieve their goals. While I’ve written on this many times before, it seems time to restate my position. First, if past trends continue, then sometimes in the next few centuries the world economy is likely to enter a transition that lasts roughly a decade, after which it may double every few months or faster, in contrast to our current fifteen year doubling time. (Doubling times have been relatively steady as innovations are typically tiny compared to the world economy.)
The most likely cause for such a transition seems to be a transition to an economy dominated by artificial intelligence (AI). (Perhaps in the form of brain emulations, but perhaps also in more alien forms.) Especially as the doubling time of a fully-automated factory today is a few months, and computer algorithm gains have been close to hardware gains. And within a year or two from then, another transition to an even faster mode might plausibly occur. Second, coordination and control are hard. Today, org leaders often gain rents from their positions, rents which come at the expense of org owners, suppliers, and customers. This happens more-so at non-profits and publicly-held for-profits, compared to privately held for-profits. Political and military leaders also gain rents, and sometimes take over control of nations via coups. While leader rents are not the only control problem, the level of such rents is a rough indication of the magnitude of our control problems. Those who are culturally more distant from leaders, such as the poor and third world residents, typically pay higher rents. Today such rents are non-trivial, but even so competition between orgs keeps them tolerable. That is, we mostly keep our orgs under control. Even though, compared to individual humans, large orgs are in effect “super-intelligences”. Third, there may be extra obstacles to slow bio humans controlling future org ventures. Bio humans would be more culturally distant, slower, and less competent than em AIs. (Though the principle-agent lit doesn’t yet show smarts differences to be an issue.) And non-em AIs could be even more culturally distant. However, even an increase of a factor of two or four in control rents for AIs seems tolerable, offering such bio humans a rich and growing future. Yes, periodically some ventures would suffer the equivalent of a coup. But if, like today, each venture were only a small part of this future world, bio humans as a whole would do fine. Ems, if they exist, could do even better.","Of course the owners of such future ventures, be they bio humans, ems, or other, are well advised to consider how best to control such ventures, to cut leader rents and other related costs of imperfect control. But such efforts seem most effective when based on actual experience with concrete fielded systems. For example, there was little folks could do in the year 1500 to figure out how to control 20th century orgs, weapons, or other tech. Thus as we now know very little about the details of future AI-based ventures, leaders, or systems, we should today mostly either save resources to devote to future efforts, or focus our innovation efforts on improving control of existing ventures. Such as via decision markets. Most of the worriers mentioned above, however, reject the above analysis, based as it is on expecting a continuation of historical patterns, wherein ventures and innovations have been consistently small compared to the world economy. They instead say that it is possible that a single small AI venture might stumble across a single extremely potent innovation, which enables it to suddenly “foom”, i.e., explode in power from tiny compared to the world economy, to more powerful than the entire rest of the world put together. (Including all other AIs.) This scenario requires that this venture prevent other ventures from using its key innovation during this explosive period. It also requires that this new more powerful system not only be far smarter in most all important areas, but also be extremely capable at managing its now-enormous internal coordination problems. And it requires that this system be not a mere tool, but a full “agent” with its own plans, goals, and actions. Furthermore it is possible that even though this system was, before this explosion, and like most all computer systems today, very well tested to assure that its behavior was aligned well with its owners’ goals across its domains of usage, its behavior after the explosion would be nearly maximally non-aligned. (That is, orthogonal in a high dim space.) Perhaps resulting in human extinction. The usual testing and monitoring processes would be prevented from either noticing this problem or calling a halt when it so noticed, either due to this explosion happening too fast, or due to this system creating and hiding divergent intentions from its owners prior to the explosion. While I agree that this is a logically possible scenario, not excluded by what we know, I am disappointed to see so many giving it such a high credence, given how crazy far it seems from our prior experience. Yes, there is a sense in which the human, farming, and industry revolutions were each likely the result of a single underlying innovation. But those were the three biggest innovations in all of human history. And large parts of the relevant prior world exploded together in those cases, not one tiny part suddenly exterminating all the rest. In addition, the roughly decade duration predicted from prior trends for the","(The future world could be a world of many AIs, some of which may be ems, some of which may be non-ems, some of which may be bio humans. But the idea that the future world is dominated by AIs is a central thesis.)
Fourth, the future world is likely to be dominated by AIs, and even if they are not ems, they are still likely to be super-intelligent. Even non-ems would be super-intelligent. That is, the level of intelligence of such AIs would be much higher than that of humans. Therefore, the control problem is not merely the problem of control by humans over AIs, but also the problem of control by AIs over themselves. In that case, the control problem is not just about the future of the world, but about the future of AIs. If AIs are not controlled, they might not be able to stay in line with human values. In that case, they might not be able to stay in line with human values. If that is the case, then even if the world is dominated by AIs, the future may be very bad. But if AIs are controlled, then the future could be good. So the question is: can we control AIs? That is, can we make sure that they stay in line with human values?
The last point is the key. The control problem is not about control of the future by humans over AIs, but about control of AIs over themselves. If AIs are not controlled, they may not be able to stay in line with human values. If that is the case, then even if the world is dominated by AIs, the future may be very bad. But if AIs are controlled, then the future could be good. So the question is: can we control AIs? That is, can we make sure that they stay in line with human values?

Robin Hanson,New Tax Career Agent Test.txt,"If that taxpayer approved, the taxes that he or she pays to the government could be diverted, and instead delivered to a “tax career agent“, who would have, in an auction, won and paid for the right to get such diverted payments from that particular taxpayer. For the government, this would like borrowing, i.e., a way to convert future tax payments into current revenue. This agent would now have incentives to advise and promote this taxpayer, but would have no unusual powers to influence this taxpayer’s behavior. Previously I used a poll to estimate that career agents today who get 10% of client wages as a result raise those wages by 1.5% on average, suggesting that tax career agents (TCAs) who got ~20% of income might raise those same wages by 3%. But as this effect might be smaller for random workers, and as worker welfare gains would be less than wage gains, I estimated that TCAs raise worker welfare by ~1% on average, which at a real interest rate of 2% suggests a ~$20T present value to the world from adopting TCAs. In my last post, I sketched a simple experiment design to test the TCA concept: give N random people TCAs, and track their income changes compared to N others who don’t. If TCAs raised wages by 0.3% per year, then given the usual random noise in wage changes, a ten year experiment with N=7000 seems sufficient, but an upper bound cost on this is ~$32M. Which is crazy cheap (~ a part in a million!) relative to TCA social value, but in our broken world we probably need something cheaper. Here is my new concept: create a TCA for each worker, but get two auction prices per worker, one price if the TCA is active, i.e., free to promote and advise that worker, and a different price if the TCA is instead passive, i.e., prevented from helping this worker. Then randomly pick if the worker gets an active or passive TCA, and use the appropriate bids and prices to pick and charge the new TCA. If there is sufficient competition in the bidding, then the difference between those two prices is a direct market estimate of how much bidders expect an active TCA to raise worker wages, minus the effort they expect an active TCA expect to put in to make this happen. This estimate is available per worker, and immediately at the experiment start. So even an N=100 experiment at a TCA expense cost of ~$1M for could give valuable data! In addition to getting TCAs to estimate worker wage increases minus TCA costs, we might also want to get workers to estimate their welfare gains. And we could do this by putting workers into pairs, only one of which gets an active TCA, and making them bid against each other to see who gets that active TCA.","Bids should give direct estimates of worker value (i.e., increased wages minus extra effort or inconvenience) if the winning bidder pays the lower bid price. These worker value estimates are also available per worker, and immediately at experiment start. And the extra revenue from worker bids cuts the cost of the experiment. TCAs and workers would have strong incentives to make good estimates, but their estimates would still be based on pretty limited information. To get better informed estimates, it would help to spread this experiment out across time, and give later participants as much info as possible about earlier participant outcomes. The more time that elapses between the first and last TCA auctions, the more later participants will know, but the longer it will take to learn results from this experiment. Note that such a sequential approach also allows the experiment to better manage its expenses in the face of an initially uncertain costs per worker participant. Here is a more detailed design based on the above concepts. Offer random workers a sufficient compensation (1% tax rebate?) so that most who are invited agree to participate for Y years. (If Y is short, pick post-college-age workers, so their choice of more schooling is less of an issue.) Participants allow substantial info on them, including their taxes, to be revealed to experimenters and other participants. Match participants into pairs who seem as similar as possible, then auction off these pairs one at a time in sequence over many years, showing all qualified bidders info on outcomes for all prior participants. Each worker in each pair is asked for the bid B they would pay for a higher chance to be assigned the active, as opposed to passive, TCA for Y years. In addition, each pair auction has eight TCA auction prices, each qualified TCA bidder can bid on any or all of these eight prices, and the highest price wins each price auction, paying the second highest among its submitted prices. To prevent collusion within worker pairs, workers are given little info on their pair partners until they have set their bids. The eight prices come from all combinations of three binary factors. First, there are the two workers, who will differ somewhat in their info. Second, there are different prices to become an active or passive TCA for Y years. Third, there are different prices depending on if the worker submitted the higher or lower bid to get the active TCA. Worker bids are kept secret until all eight TCA auction prices are set. Then the worker who bid more gets a 2/3 chance of being assigned the active TCA, and a 1/3 chance of being assigned the passive TCA. Given a bid B, we can estimate their added value V of having an active agent via V = 3B. Note that at a 2% discount rate, the present value of 20% of the median US wage of $31K is ~$450K, 1% of which is ~$4.5K, implying a bid","If the worker who gets the TCA has a higher expected value of the TCA, then they would bid more and win. So the difference in bid amounts would be a direct estimate of the value of the TCA to that worker. This is a very low cost experiment, which would be possible to run with small N, and which would give us a lot of data about TCA effects. I think this is a very promising way to test TCA ideas. I am now going to try to make a concrete proposal for a small scale experiment. I would like to run a small experiment with N=100 people, and I think the cost is about $1M, which is within budget. The idea is to have 50 people in each group: 50 active and 50 passive. We can do this with a simple mechanism: have 50 active TCA bidders and 50 passive TCA bidders. Each TCA bidder bids for the right to be a TCA for one person. Each person is assigned to one of the two groups. If a TCA bidder is assigned to active group, they are given the right to bid on one person (so that they can get a TCA for that person). If they are in the passive group, they are given the right to bid on one person, but the TCA can’t help them. The TCA bidders are all individuals.

So, for example, if someone is in the active group, and they get a TCA for themselves, then they are in a situation where they can be advised by a TCA. If they are in the passive group, they can't.

Robin Hanson,A Perfect Storm of Inflexibility.txt,"Most biological species specialize for particular ecological niches. But some species are generalists, “specializing” in doing acceptably well in a wider range of niches, and thus also in rapidly changing niches. Generalist species tend to be more successful at generating descendant species. Humans are such a generalist species, in part via our unusual intelligence. Today, firms in rapidly changing environments focus more on generality and flexibility. For example, CEO Andy Grove focused on making Intel flexible:
In Only the Paranoid Survive, Grove reveals his strategy for measuring the nightmare moment every leader dreads–when massive change occurs and a company must, virtually overnight, adapt or fall by the wayside–in a new way. A focus on flexibility is part of why tech firms tend more often to colonize other industries today, rather than vice versa. War is an environment that especially rewards generality and flexibility. “No plan survives contact with the enemy,” they say. Militaries often lose by preparing too well for the last war, and not adapting flexibly enough to new context. We usually pay extra for military equipment that can function in a wider range of environments, and train soldiers for a wider range of scenarios than we train most workers. Centralized control has many costs, but one of its benefits is that it promotes rapid thoughtful coordination. Which is why most wars are run from a center. Familiar social institutions tend to be run by those who have run parts of them well recently. As a result, long periods of peace and stability tend to promote specialists, who have learned well how to win within a relatively narrow range of situations. And those people tend to change our rules and habits to suit themselves. Thus rule and habit changes tend to improve performance for rulers and their allies within the usual situations, often at the expense of flexibility for a wider range of situations. As a result, long periods of peace and stability tend to produce fragility, making us more vulnerable to big sudden changes. This is in part why software rots, and why institutions rot as well. (Generality is also often just more expensive.)
Through most of the farming era, war was the main driver pushing generality and flexibility. Societies that became too specialized and fragile lost the next big war, and were replaced by more flexible competitors. Revolutions and pandemics also contributed. As the West has been peaceful and stable for a long time now, alas we must expect that our institutions and culture have been becoming more fragile, and more vulnerable to big unexpected crises. Such as this current pandemic. And in fact the East, which has been adapting to a lot more changes over the last few decades, including similar pandemics, has been more flexible, and is doing better. Being more authoritarian and communitarian also helps, as it tends to help in war-like times.","In addition to these two considerations, longer peace/stability and more democracy, we have two more reasons to expect problems with inflexibility in this crisis. The first is that medical experts tend to think less generally. To put it bluntly, most are bad at abstraction. I first noticed this when I was a RWJF social science health policy scholar, and under an exchange program I went to the RWJF medical science health policy scholar conference. Biomed scholars are amazing in managing enormous masses of details, and bringing up just the right examples for any one situation. But most find it hard to think about probabilities, cost-benefit tradeoffs, etc. In my standard talk on my book Age of Em, I show this graph of the main academic fields, highlighting the fields I’ve studied: Academia is a ring of fields where all the abstract ones are on one side, far from the detail-oriented biomed fields on the other side. (I’m good at and love abstractions, but have have limited tolerance or ability for mastering masses of details.) So to the extent pandemic policy is driven by biomed academics, don’t expect it to be very flexible or abstractly reasoned. And my personal observation is that, of the people I’ve seen who have had insightful things to say recently about this pandemic, most are relatively flexible and abstract polymaths and generalists, not lost-in-the-weeds biomed experts. The other reason to expect a problem with flexibility in responding to this pandemic is: many of the most interesting solutions seem blocked by ethics-driven medical regulations. As communities have strong needs to share ethical norms, and most people aren’t very good at abstraction, ethical norms tend to be expressed relatively concretely. Which makes it hard to change them when circumstances change rapidly. Furthermore we actually tend to punish the exceptional people who reason more abstractly about ethics, as we don’t trust them to have the right feelings. Now humans do seem to have a special wartime ethics, which is more abstract and flexible. But we are quite reluctant to invoke that without war, even if millions seem likely to die in a pandemic. If billions seemed likely to die, maybe we would. We instead seem inclined to invoke the familiar medical ethics norm of “pay any cost to save lives”, which has pushed us into apparently endless and terribly expensive lockdowns, which may well end up doing more damage than the virus. And which may not actually prevent most from getting infected, leading to a near worst possible outcome. In which we would pay a terrible cost for our med ethics inflexibility. When a sudden crisis appears, I suspect that generalists tend to know that this is a potential time for them to shine, and many of them put much effort into seeing if they can win respect by using their generality to help. But I expect that the usual rulers and experts, who have specialized in the usual ways of doing things, are well aware of this possibility,","But the problem is that, in peace time, this might make it harder to change or adapt, or to be open to new ideas. So, the author's argument seems to be that:
A) Institutions that are too specialized and fragile are more vulnerable to sudden crises.
B) Peace and stability lead to more flexible and resilient institutions.
C) War is the only driver of generality and flexibility in human societies.
D) Long periods of peace and stability tend to promote specialists who have learned to win within a relatively narrow range of situations.
E) The East is more flexible than the West because of its authoritarian and communitarian nature.

Which of the following is the best choice for the answer?
A) Institutions that are too specialized and fragile are more vulnerable to sudden crises.
B) Peace and stability lead to more flexible and resilient institutions.
C) War is the only driver of generality and flexibility in human societies.
D) Long periods of peace and stability tend to promote specialists who have learned to win within a relatively narrow range of situations.
E) The East is more flexible than the West because of its authoritarian and communitarian nature.

Okay, let's try to work through this question. The passage is about how generalist species, like humans, are better at adapting to changing environments. The author uses examples like tech companies and militaries to illustrate the importance of flexibility. They also mention that long periods of peace and stability lead to specialized institutions, which become fragile and vulnerable to sudden changes, like the current pandemic. The East, which has faced more changes, is more flexible and doing better. 

The question is asking which of the options best captures the author's main argument. Let's go through each option:

A) Institutions that are too specialized and fragile are more vulnerable to sudden crises. The passage does say that long periods of peace lead to fragile institutions, which are vulnerable to big changes. This seems to be a key point. The author mentions that the West is",479,500,341,0.1203,0.3552,0.9702,0.9595,0.7656,0.8784,5.4663,-2.17,0.3076,0.4584,0.0296,0.1559,0.0018,0.0756,0.3982,0.4491,0.9624,0.9558,0.3844731977818854,0.426056338028169,0.4117647058823529,6,7,0.9807,0.8744,0.12317327766179541,0.12,0.1466275659824047,0.9432,0.7899,29-05-2025
Robin Hanson,Culture Policy Is Neglected.txt,"Long ago in physics I learned of the Union of Concerned Scientists. Then in computer science I learned of Computer Professionals For Social Responsibility. Each struggled to gain respect. Later I saw how economists treat policy. In all these areas, I saw most “scientists” taking roughly this stance:
On policy where science seems relevant, the world should defer to listen to our most prestigious scientists. But, policy is not science, even if science sometimes has policy implications. So doing policy work doesn’t count toward scientific reputation, and often detracts. Also, there’s no need to study anything besides your usual science to do policy well. So for max policy influence, first gain max science prestige, then announce policy opinions. There’s no shame in ignoring policy; your science is what matters. Yes, policy is more respected in some academic departments, like public policy and business, areas less eager to be seen as “science”. I’ve spent the last five months pondering culture, and upon finding what seem like big policy problems there, I’ve been puzzled to not find other cultural evolution academics much worried about them. I’ve read and watched many, and talked to a few. But watching a 2.5 hour interview by Joseph Walker of two top such, Robert Boyd and Peter Richerson, helped me understand: they avoid policy to seem “scientific”. Boyd and Richerson very much want to be seen as “scientists” (this interview mentions “scientist” 7 times and “science” 17 times), especially so given how many see social science, and especially cultural studies, as low status and “not science”. So while Boyd and Richerson do in fact notice some of the big problems I see, like modern status markers cutting fertility, causing a population fall, with our civ plausibly replaced by Amish-like, they just don’t seem worried, nor do they seek fixes. Why? Boyd does mistakenly think population fall won’t hurt innovation much, probably from not knowing relevant economics literatures. But I suspect the deeper cause here is that cultural evolution specialists treat policy analysis as unscientific, and thus someone else’s job. Oh they’ll dabble a bit if it comes up in casual conversation, but they have little energy for digging deeper. Their job is to stand outside cultures modeling them, not to stand inside recommending cultural moves. This is a problem because others like myself has much less standing to be taken seriously in making claims about the policy implications of cultural evolution. Here are selected quotes, which I claim support my interpretation:
RICHERSON: … in our ’85 book we have a little vignette about the demographic transition in which we attribute it to … If education becomes a major source of economic success and prestige, then people who spend a long time furthering their education and start their families late will have an advantage in getting into prestige positions, … So you're sacrificing your genetic fitness for your cultural fitness, so to speak. …
BOYD: I’d predict the same thing for urbanisation expansions in the past.","So if we could go back to Tenochtitlan or Rome and get good measures of fertility, I'd predict the urban people would get sucked up into the same thing because they have these wider social networks. … RICHERSON: the Anabaptists, to take an example where the demographic transition is not happening, … they seal their prestige system off from the rest of us quite tightly. Things like movies and … They seal themselves culturally off. And they maintain small communities that are rich in kin. So they are working on both of those things simultaneously. … WALKER: It'd be interesting to see whether the world's Amish in a few centuries. RICHERSON: Yeah. Well, I mean, the other group that's a little like this is the ultra-orthodox Jews, and they're numerous enough now in Israel to be a political problem – or a political force, let's put it that way. So not to prejudge. Yeah, but who knows what … It's hard to predict what will happen to that whole phenomenon. … WALKER: Does the fact that fertility-reducing behaviours don't seem to be being fixed very quickly imply that cultural group selection has weakened and that we have low variation? … BOYD: We do have low variation. WALKER: And we're in some kind of, like, global macro culture? … the archetype is like the Davos-style elite. Because we're all interconnected through telecommunications technologies. BOYD: We do have a macro culture in the sense that urban life, bureaucratic government … Educational systems that take a lot of time, that's shared more or less, to varying degrees, across the world. I mean, development agencies are trying as hard as they can to make everybody else do it too. WALKER: Am I making an analytical error? Could we infer from the fact that the demographic transition isn't being fixed in all these different countries that cultural evolution is happening too slowly and therefore there must be low variation? RICHERSON: Well, the trouble is … you mentioned non-parental transmission. Cultural culture, in lots of cases, will result in adaptations that would fix problems with genetic fitness, but that's not guaranteed at all. So cultural evolution can favour fitness-diminishing behaviour. So selection on cultural variation will not necessarily be correlated with the selection on genetic fitness. Globally, overall, in human evolution, it had to have been true that there was some kind of correlation between cultural fitness and genetic fitness, or else culture wouldn't have evolved, right? It would have been extinguished by selection. But … BOYD: That doesn't have to be true for even the last 10,000 years. RICHERSON: No. BOYD: Especially if you think brains are getting smaller. I don't see any clear reason to predict that cultural evolution should favour higher genetic fitness, except that our brains have evolved to … We like sweet things and we don't want to die and lots of fitness-enhancing things. But if cultural evolution has finessed that by creating prestige systems, I don't see any reason it","But in the current case, the demographic transition is not just a matter of the people who are more educated being more likely to have fewer children. It's also that there's a growing number of people who are not only more educated, but who have higher levels of status, and this is the case in many countries. …
So, the two of us have written about this before, and we have a paper that we've published in the Journal of Human Evolution that shows that in the United States, the proportion of the population that is highly educated is growing rapidly. So, the people who are highly educated are having fewer children. But that is only part of the story. The other part is that this is a result of the fact that in the United States, the people who are highly educated and have high status are the ones who are having fewer children. That is, they are the people who are not only more educated, but have higher status. So, the demographic transition is due to both education and status, and that’s a very important point to make.
So, in these quotes, they acknowledge that there is a demographic transition with educational and status-based fertility decline. However, they do not address the implications of this. In fact, they do not even mention the idea that this might be a problem. So, even though they acknowledge a problem, they don't see it as a problem. That's the crux. The problem is that cultural evolution specialists like Boyd and Richerson do not consider policy implications. So, when someone like myself says that this is a problem, they don’t take me seriously. But if I had been a cultural evolution specialist, I would be taken more seriously. So, the question is: why do cultural evolution specialists not consider policy implications?

The problem here is that cultural evolution specialists, like Boyd and Richerson, are focused on understanding and explaining how cultural traits evolve, rather than on applying their findings to policy.
